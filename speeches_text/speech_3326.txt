<p data-HoCid="8108645" data-originallang="en">Meanwhile, I completely understand how dire the situation in Gaza is. It is one of the worst places in the world to live right now. The <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">Minister of Immigration</a> and I are working actively to find a very compassionate approach when it comes to Canadians and their families, and we will get Canadians out of Gaza. I am in close contact with my Israeli and Egyptian counterparts to make sure that the Kouta family can come back to Canada.</p>
