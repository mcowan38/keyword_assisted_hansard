<p data-HoCid="8399307" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8399308" data-originallang="en">I did watch part of <a data-HoCid="300005" href="/politicians/randy-boissonnault/" title="Randy Boissonnault">Minister Boissonnault</a>'s testimony yesterday. I know he's going to come here and provide us with the facts in the case, which I think is sorely lacking in the social media clips that have been generated. I just want to reiterate that I do think the Ethics Commissioner should be able to do their work on this, if that's the case. I'm concerned that we're constantly going down these rabbit holes of “gotcha” moments to try to derail studies, like the one that we've been doing on misinformation and disinformation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8399309" data-originallang="en">I know my colleague from the Bloc is an honourable person, and I appreciate where he's going with this, but I do have concerns that we're constantly going down the lobbying.... I have the utmost respect for my NDP colleague, but rather than doing it with different news stories, why don't we just do a study on the act itself instead of trying to tie it to individual situations? I believe his concern is genuine about the grey areas in the act—then that's what we should be looking at, not individual cases.</p>
