<p data-HoCid="8412220" data-originallang="en">I think it's pretty clear that we're witnessing a filibuster on a motion to study the rise of the far right. The far right is clearly anti-Semitic. It is clearly Islamophobic. This is exactly what we want to look into, so I don't understand why the Conservatives are wasting our time and why we don't get to the vote on this motion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412221" data-originallang="en"> If they believe that they want to look into anti-Semitism, then let's see them vote for this motion, and let's cut this filibuster. We're wasting the witnesses' time. We're all wasting our time.</p>
