<p data-HoCid="7870201" data-originallang="en">This is amendment CPC-34. There is a CPC-35 and a CPC-36 as well. I move that Bill <a data-HoCid="11777172" href="/bills/44-1/S-245/" title="An Act to amend the Citizenship Act (granting citizenship to certain Canadians)">S-245</a> be amended by adding after line 18 on page 1 the following new clause:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7870202" data-originallang="en"> 1.4 Section 24 of the Act is amended by adding the following: </p>
<p data-HoCid="7870203" data-originallang="en"> Respecting holidays and days of significance to promote Canada’s multicultural identity </p>
<p data-HoCid="7870204" data-originallang="en"> 24.1 (20) Citizenship ceremonies may not be scheduled on Hanukkah. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7870205" data-originallang="en">In brief, the eight-day Jewish celebration known as Hanukkah commemorates the rededication during the second century before Christ of the second temple in Jerusalem. Often called the “festival of lights”, the holiday is celebrated with the lighting of the menorah, games, traditional foods like latkes and doughnuts, and playing games with the dreidel, which is a little instrument that you spin. It's kind of like a die, but you get to spin it too.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7870206" data-originallang="en">I think it's important to ensure that we don't have citizenship ceremonies on days when persons practising the Jewish faith will be unable to attend a citizenship ceremony to take the oath and would much rather spend time with their families. Hanukkah is a very important holiday. It's one of those high holy days in the Jewish calendar.</p>
