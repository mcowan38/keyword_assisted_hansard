<p data-HoCid="8576502" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I will try to be as eloquent and relevant as my colleague from Saint-Jean. She gave a bit of a preview of what the Bloc Québécois will be talking about this evening. We really want to set aside all partisanship in tonight's debate. This is an emergency debate on how we can have an impact on peace in Lebanon and on the populations affected there. I commend my colleague on her speech. I will try to live up to what she has just said.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576503" data-originallang="fr">I will begin this speech by expressing my sincere and profound thoughts for all the families and people affected by the conflict we are discussing this evening. Our thoughts are with the people affected, who are all too often the first victims of these armed conflicts. As my colleague from <a data-HoCid="278372" href="/politicians/christine-normandin/" title="Christine Normandin">Saint-Jean</a> said just before me, the situation in the Middle East is alarming and getting worse by the minute.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576504" data-originallang="fr">Following a week of heavy Israeli bombing, Israel has just launched a ground offensive in Lebanon, a targeted offensive as we understand it. Thus far, Israel's air strikes have reportedly killed nearly 1,000 people and wounded more than 2,770 people as of yesterday. Earlier today, the deaths of two Canadian nationals were reported. That is what we feared the most, that the conflict would flare up at the regional level. That obviously seems to be happening. Once again, the federal government is failing to show any leadership.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576505" data-originallang="fr">I will explain. As my colleague from Saint-Jean said a little earlier, in 2006, the federal government evacuated approximately 15,000 Canadians, mainly by sea. At the time, there were between 40,000 and 50,000 Canadians in Lebanon. This intervention by the Canadian government was criticized, not for the nature of the evacuation, but for the way in which the federal government contacted and informed nationals. In 2006, the Government of Canada relied on telephone lines and Internet messaging, while a large part of the country was without power. As for the telephone lines, we were told that they were in operation only on weekdays, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., which is bordering on indecency.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576506" data-originallang="fr">This poor choice of communication channels seems to be a recurring problem at the federal level when an international crisis is developing, be it an armed conflict or a natural disaster. We need only think of Haiti in 2010. It is as if the government does not learn from its mistakes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576507" data-originallang="fr">The situation sadly unfolding before our eyes today is very similar to the one we saw during the evacuation of Afghanistan. I was on the Special Committee on Afghanistan in 2022. My fear is that Canada has not learned from its mistakes, as I just said. Once again, we are witnessing Canada's lack of leadership on the international stage.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576508" data-originallang="fr">At the risk of repeating myself and at the risk of repeating what my colleague said, I would like to say that last May, the Bloc Québécois proposed 10 measures to the Canadian government regarding the conflict in Gaza. They are as follows: </p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8576509" data-originallang="fr"> Reiterate Canada's support for an immediate ceasefire and the free flow of medical, food and humanitarian aid throughout the Gaza Strip; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8576510" data-originallang="fr"> Support the Arab League in its call for the creation of an international peacekeeping force to be deployed to the occupied Palestinian territories until a functional Palestinian state is established; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8576511" data-originallang="fr"> Adopt a full moratorium on the export of any potential military-use technology to Israel; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8576512" data-originallang="fr"> Apply Canada's sanctions regime to target Israeli ministers who are openly calling for crimes against humanity in Gaza and to target more extremist settlers in the West Bank; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8576513" data-originallang="fr"> Immediately exclude occupied territories from the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement in order to stop providing trade benefits to the illegal West Bank settlements, contributing to their economic prosperity; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8576514" data-originallang="fr"> Join the many countries that have recently recognized the Palestinian state by recognizing Palestine, while reiterating the support for a two-state solution; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8576515" data-originallang="fr"> Support the International Court of Justice and possibly the International Criminal Court to uphold international law and commit to arresting any person against whom an arrest warrant is issued and who may be on Canadian territory; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8576516" data-originallang="fr"> Reiterate that any deliberate obstruction of humanitarian access to Gaza is a war crime and will lead to Canadian sanctions against those responsible; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8576517" data-originallang="fr"> Develop and state a clear and predictable policy by Global Affairs Canada on Gaza; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8576518" data-originallang="fr"> Reiterate the rejection of Hamas and consider new sanctions against countries that provide logistical, financial or other support to that terrorist group. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8576519" data-originallang="fr">Those are the Bloc's proposals.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576520" data-originallang="fr">We add our voice to those of the G7 countries that support the ceasefire proposal put forward by the United States and France, in the hope that a break in fighting will enable a diplomatic path to be found.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576521" data-originallang="fr">That said, this will require a sustained effort from Canada. The conflict is currently spreading to Lebanon, and Israeli air strikes are reaching as far as Beirut. Israel is scaling up its attacks and, according to many, is preparing for a ground invasion. Not only is it preparing, but it has already begun, albeit in a targeted manner. Even so, Israel is conducting ground operations in Lebanon. It is an alarming situation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576522" data-originallang="fr">Many airlines have suspended their flights to Lebanon, which has greatly reduced the opportunities for many people, including Canadian nationals, to leave the country. According to Global Affairs Canada, there are 45,000 Canadian nationals in Lebanon, and evacuation efforts so far appear to be modest. Canada is apparently content to reserve seats on commercial flights. The federal government reported that it has reserved 800 seats on commercial flights, while, as I mentioned earlier, several airlines have cancelled their flights to Lebanon for obvious security reasons.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576523" data-originallang="fr">The Canadian government has reportedly negotiated an agreement with an airline to keep flights going, but if the airport becomes dysfunctional, I do not see how it will be possible to continue evacuating people by air. What is more, as my colleague from <a data-HoCid="278372" href="/politicians/christine-normandin/" title="Christine Normandin">Saint-Jean</a> said, Canadian nationals will have to pay full price for the reserved seats. Given the economic situation in Lebanon, that will not necessarily be easy, especially for large families. Since the Beirut airport is the only major airport in Lebanon, I am worried that many people will have to pay a lot of money and will still not be guaranteed a flight back to Canada. People will have to take the risk of paying and perhaps not being able to leave, which may make them reluctant to book flights to leave the country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576524" data-originallang="fr">We also know that evacuation by ship could be an alternative, but only when ships are available, and we do not have any information about that. To make matters worse, Lebanon has been in the midst of an unprecedented socio-economic crisis since 2019. On August 4, 2020, an explosion devastated the city of Beirut and destroyed Lebanon's biggest port, which was also the main point of entry for the country's food imports.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576525" data-originallang="fr"> I therefore have serious doubts about the ability to safely evacuate nationals by sea, given that the situation has only worsened since then. In a country already facing economic insecurity and a refugee crisis, now there are also air strikes and ground attacks.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576526" data-originallang="fr">As I said at the start of my speech, the situation is alarming and, as we have seen throughout the day, it has been steadily deteriorating. As these events unfold before our very eyes right now, my thoughts and, I believe, the thoughts of everyone in the House and those who are not here, but who sit here, are with the people who are currently living in fear, real fear. These are people who are all too often and sadly the first victims of armed conflict and who deserve to see us do everything in our power, as parliamentarians, to help them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576527" data-originallang="fr">I urge all the parliamentarians taking part in this debate tonight to try as hard as they can to imagine a family currently hunkered down in an apartment in Beirut. I ask them to imagine a father and mother trying to protect their children. I doubt that they are aware that we are having this debate tonight. I urge all of my colleagues to think about these people and perhaps set aside some attacks that might let them score political points.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576528" data-originallang="fr">Rather than do that, I sincerely call on all my colleagues, and without any animosity, to think of these people who fear for their children's lives. I think that we can answer some of the questions asked by my colleague from Saint-Jean today if we really want to. Can we work productively with these people in mind and try to have even a small impact, even if we are thousands of kilometres away from this conflict? Are we able to sit down together, work together and save lives? That is basically what should be our greatest concern tonight. I urge my colleagues to think this way and to think of those people who are currently fearing for their lives.</p>
