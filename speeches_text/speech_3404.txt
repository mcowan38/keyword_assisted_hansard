<p data-HoCid="8185445" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8185446" data-originallang="en">I certainly agree with the points that you've made, Ms. Tait, that the issue of disinformation and hate.... We've seen the far right and their massive propaganda infrastructure, Fox Media, and Meta, which allows through its algorithms tragic growth of toxic hate in all of its forms, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, racism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, all of those toxic forms of hate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8185447" data-originallang="en">We need to have an institution like the CBC that provides that balance and provides for the real information to counter the far-right disinformation that is washing over North America.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8185448" data-originallang="en">I note a couple of things. First off are the massive subsidies—a billion dollars per year—that go to Meta and Google when they have not been responsible in any way in being a voice to counter this hate and disinformation. Do you feel it's appropriate that the federal government subsidize so massively and directly the advertising for Meta and Google?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8185449" data-originallang="en">Second, you've mentioned the growth of digital services. You mentioned the streaming service, Gem. I'd like you to take the opportunity to talk more about the budget that you have in terms of digital and streaming services and what the results have been, both of promoting digital resources—you flagged the BBC—and of promoting streaming services like Gem. What have the results been?</p>
