What is worse is that the department at this point in time is unable to clarify for us, for the sector, the extent of this decision, meaning, does it extend to parts and components within platforms like F-35, for example? Then, because the department cannot give us clarity on that, there is a concern coming out of industry that this will harm 50% of our market share, which is our export market with the United States, largely serviced under the Defence Production Sharing Agreement. </p>
