<p data-HoCid="7546362" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I wish a happy new year to all.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7546363" data-originallang="en">The word “genocide” is not one to be used lightly. According to the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7546364" data-originallang="en"> genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: </p>
<p data-HoCid="7546365" data-originallang="en"> (a) Killing members of the group; </p>
<p data-HoCid="7546366" data-originallang="en"> (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; </p>
<p data-HoCid="7546367" data-originallang="en"> (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; </p>
<p data-HoCid="7546368" data-originallang="en"> (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; </p>
<p data-HoCid="7546369" data-originallang="en"> (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7546370" data-originallang="en">It was with that definition in mind that this House, on February 22, 2021, recognized that genocide is indeed taking place, being carried out by the People's Republic of China against Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7546371" data-originallang="en">Since that motion passed in the House, the government has not addressed the concerns it raised. The UN human rights commissioner recently released a report again highlighting the atrocities being committed against Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims by the Chinese regime. If we do not act now, when will we?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7546372" data-originallang="en">The Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration unanimously passed a motion calling on the government to extend existing special immigration measures to Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims, allow Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims in third countries who are at risk of being deported back to China to seek refuge in Canada, and waive the UNHCR determination for Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims. This motion is in the same spirit as that one.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7546373" data-originallang="en">It is no surprise that the Chinese government, even in the face of overwhelming evidence, denies what is taking place. In doing this, it is following the pattern set by other autocratic regimes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7546374" data-originallang="en">The government of modern Russia continues to deny the death of millions of innocent Ukrainians in the Holodomor, even as once again it is assaulting the Ukrainian people. Like the Chinese, it denies the history. The world knows better.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7546375" data-originallang="en">Germany at least has accepted that the Holocaust not only happened but is a national shame. The German people have worked hard to be able to say “never again”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7546376" data-originallang="en">Standing against genocide is very personal to many people, but there are times when we must do more than just take a stand. This motion is a call for action.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7546377" data-originallang="en">Given the situation Uighurs face, this motion calls on the government to: </p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7546378" data-originallang="en"> urgently leverage Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada’s Refugee and Humanitarian Resettlement Program to expedite the entry of 10,000 Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in need of protection, over two years starting in 2024 into Canada; </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7546379" data-originallang="en">This House has already stated that the crimes against the Uighur people are a genocide. The time has come to do more than just offer words of support, unless all we want is for the world to see how virtuous we are, how we are on the right side. We must do more, but what should that “more” look like?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7546380" data-originallang="en">It seems simple to say that we must open our borders, that in a country with as much geography as Canada, 10,000 or more people are easily accommodated. Perhaps there are logistical questions in moving thousands of people from the other side of the world to Canada, but if there is a will, logistics can be overcome.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7546381" data-originallang="en">However, we need to remember there is more to this equation than geography and seeing how many people can fit into a particular space. We are not talking about numbers here. We are talking about people, people who have been driven from their homes in fear of their lives and who have been persecuted in ways many of us cannot imagine.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7546382" data-originallang="en">It is not that they want to leave China, but faced with a choice of life or death, they have chosen life. A new life in Canada can offer hope, hope for a new life in a peaceful land where they will not suffer for their ethnicity or their religion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7546383" data-originallang="en">I know, first-hand, that it is possible, for I have experienced Canada as a welcoming place, but should it be the first choice? Has anyone thought to ask those fleeing the genocide if coming to Canada is their first choice or their second or their third? Maybe starting fresh in Canada seems more appealing than life in refugee camps, but do they know the reality of what life looks like in Canada? I applaud the spirit of this motion, but I wonder if we have explored all options.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7546384" data-originallang="en">Would these refugees be happier if a way could be found for them to be integrated into community life in the countries where they have taken refuge, rather than travelling across the world to a place with an unfamiliar language and culture? Could Canada help with that?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7546385" data-originallang="en">The government is not very good at hands-on compassion. Ask any recently arrived immigrant. Many who come here find that Canada is not that promised land after all. The truth is that people fleeing conflict zones and attempted genocide need more than just a roof over their heads and a few language lessons. They need to know that they are safe and accepted, that there are people in this new land who are very happy to see them, who want to be their friends and who value them for who they are.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7546386" data-originallang="en">Government programs, no matter how well-meaning, cannot replace the personal touch. Those fleeing genocide, and indeed all newcomers to Canada, need someone who can help with the basics. For some, that would be a family member who has come here before them, but for most of those fleeing conflict, such as the Uighurs, it would be a Canadian reaching out in friendship to a newcomer.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7546387" data-originallang="en">That is what we did with the boat people coming from Vietnam in the early 1980s. That is what we have been doing with those refugees who came from Syria seven years ago, and those who continue to arrive on our shores today. We, here, can say, “Let us bring in these people who need our help”, but it is the Canadian people who will make these newcomers feel welcome.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7546388" data-originallang="en">Conservatives believe that Canada's immigration system should uphold Canada's humanitarian tradition of providing safe haven for refugees. I think that may be something that all political parties can agree on.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7546389" data-originallang="en">There may be some who are concerned about the reaction from the government of the People's Republic of China, which has been trying to have the countries where the Uighurs have taken refuge return the refugees, in violation of international law.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7546390" data-originallang="en">I would not be surprised if the Chinese ambassador to Canada calls me to complain about the words I have chosen to use today. His government insists that there is no genocide and feels insulted when people talk about it. I would invite the ambassador to take a trip with me to the border areas of the neighbouring countries where the Uighurs have fled. I would invite him to talk with the refugees, to hear their stories, and then I would ask him again if there is no genocide.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7546391" data-originallang="en">I doubt I will have that opportunity, but we in this House do have the opportunity to show our support for the Uighur people. I urge all hon. members to do so.</p>
