<p data-HoCid="6736389" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, my colleague from the NDP knows I have a great deal of respect for him. We do agree on some issues here and there.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6736390" data-originallang="en">On his comment about that, I will go back to my comments before. We need to have supports as people begin to recover. I am frustrated that we have to offer CERB as we go into this summer, because parts of our country will be reopening.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6736391" data-originallang="en"> We have made it very clear that we need to be there for our businesses, we need to be there for individuals, but for me, that means getting more vaccines into arms quickly so we can safely reopen. July is almost a year and a half after this started. We are months behind the United Kingdom, the United States, Israel and other countries that have had successful rollouts. The fact that we need to have this and the fact that are businesses are not allowed to reopen, flourish and regrow our economy is a failure in itself.</p>
