<p data-HoCid="7345709" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345710" data-originallang="en">I recognize that a motion of this nature has been entertained at this committee before; however, at that time we did not have all of the information that we now have. Based on the testimony that has been brought forward by Minister Hussen, we now know that, indeed, about half a million dollars was given to Mr. Marouf and his wife, a.k.a. the organization. That's the entire organization. That was given by the CRTC. We know, based on Mr. Hussen's testimony, that it is <a data-HoCid="278929" href="/politicians/pablo-rodriguez/" title="Pablo Rodriguez">Minister Rodriguez</a> who oversees the heritage department, which oversees the CRTC, which gave the funding.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345711" data-originallang="en">It would then seem to be of interest to this committee to hear from <a data-HoCid="278929" href="/politicians/pablo-rodriguez/" title="Pablo Rodriguez">Minister Rodriguez</a> in terms of this funding, how that vetting process was conducted, why that funding was granted in the first place and what actions are going to be taken in order to mitigate risk going forward.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345712" data-originallang="en">I say risk because to have someone like Mr. Marouf on Twitter and other social media platforms spewing hate of the worst kind.... I don't even know that you can say that. All forms of hate are disgusting, but there is something extraordinarily vile about Mr. Marouf's approach. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7345713" data-originallang="en">Money was given to this individual when there was clear evidence showing that he is an extremely vile individual who engages in not only racist rhetoric but calls for outright violence and celebration of violence that has already been done. Given that this is the fact, it seems appropriate that the minister would be given an opportunity to answer for his department's decisions and how they might make changes going forward.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345714" data-originallang="en">I think this whole situation is very shocking. This summer when I first became aware of Mr. Marouf's statements, I know that I, for one, was very shocked, appalled and surprised. I watched as Canadians responded. I saw their grief, frustration, outrage and pain. It was pain for many of them. There are many who are a part of the Jewish community and many who are allies with the Jewish community. They see conduct like that, and it impacts them deeply.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345715" data-originallang="en">The truth is that I wish it impacted all of us deeply. I wish Minister Hussen had been impacted at a deeper level so that it would not have taken him a month to finally respond with any sort statement of condemnation towards the conduct of Mr. Marouf.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345716" data-originallang="en">The point is this. There are these vile, absolutely disgusting tweets and other social media engagements that are out there. Somehow that was missed in the vetting process. Mr. Hussen has said that he's going to undertake an investigation or a review process of some kind in order to look into that and hopefully fix the vetting process.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345717" data-originallang="en">We do not know what <a data-HoCid="278929" href="/politicians/pablo-rodriguez/" title="Pablo Rodriguez">Mr. Rodriguez</a> is going to do on his side with regard to the half a million dollars of funding that has been awarded by the CRTC. What about that vetting process? What did that look like? How did Mr. Marouf get missed? What's going to be done in order to rectify that situation? How are we going to ensure that Canadian tax dollars are not put towards the perpetuation of racism in the future? As this government has stated, and I hope I can take them at their word, they want to fight racism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345718" data-originallang="en"> Again, I find that somewhat difficult to fully believe or give credit to when we have a minister before us who took more than a month—more than a month—just to open his mouth and say something, let alone take action. I actually would say that inaction, therefore, makes him complicit in racism. He actually lent to its perpetuation. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7345719" data-originallang="en">However, if the true desire going forward is for change, then I would suggest that we give <a data-HoCid="278929" href="/politicians/pablo-rodriguez/" title="Pablo Rodriguez">Mr. Rodriguez</a> the opportunity to share with us his vision for his department and the actions that he will take going forward in order to rectify this, in order to make sure that Canadians are assured—assured of their safety, assured of their well-being, assured that their tax dollars will be used wisely, assured that they are not made complicit in extending racism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345720" data-originallang="en"> I sure don't want my tax dollars used in that way, and I don't think anyone on this committee call right now wants their tax dollars to be used in that way. So, for that reason, for the reason of accountability, for the reason of transparency—</p>
