<p data-HoCid="6312638" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, thanks for the opportunity to come back to my second home. I just want to open up, first of all, by giving some shout-outs, some thanks, some hellos, if you don't mind, to the most important people in the room: the staff. This is a shout-out to Dillan and Angela. You are blessed, Madam Chair, with a couple of the most amazing staff people on the entire parliamentary precinct. You're very, very well served.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6312639" data-originallang="en">I also, of course, want to give a shout-out to my former colleagues Shawn, Kevin and Dean. Can I just underscore the fact that Dean went out of his way to come today, given that he didn't have a very long tenure? He and I started on this project back in 2004 when neither one of us knew what the public accounts committee was or what the work was. To me, the fact that he would come back today to underscore its importance says a lot about him, and it also says a lot about the importance of the work of the PACP committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6312640" data-originallang="en">I also want to give a shout-out to Chandra, who was nice enough to come. He was on the last committee. Again, I think he's here because he's underscoring what that committee meant to him and the importance of it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6312641" data-originallang="en">Jean, guess what, Jean? Remember when I used to talk about how tough it was at the beginning of the last Parliament, when I was the only one who had any experience and I spent half my time doing training as much as I was participating? Well, guess what? Now it's on you, and you came part way through the last Parliament, so you're going to be a touchstone for them, Jean. I know that you may feel that you don't have a lot of experience, but your experience is a thousand times more than everybody else's. I think you're going to play a key role in helping the committee pick up what I think was the culture of the best PAC committee we ever had. I'd like to say that this was during my leadership, but it wasn't; it was actually during Kevin's, because of the makeup of the committee and who we had there, and because of his tremendous leadership.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6312642" data-originallang="en">Shawn, you were great. I'd like to think that I was okay, but Kevin's the one who hit the sweet spot with all the right people in the right place.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6312643" data-originallang="en">Obviously, I want to give a quick shout-out to my buddy Matt Green, who is ensuring that Hamilton Centre stays at the public accounts committee now for the 16th year in a row. Way to go, Matt. You're going to do a great job.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6312644" data-originallang="en">I saw that Greg is on there. Greg has not been a part of this committee, but Greg and I developed a bit of a friendship in the last Parliament based on Mauril Bélanger and our relationship there.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6312645" data-originallang="en">Greg and Matt, I want to give you guys a shout-out for the work you're doing on the Parliamentary Black caucus. You're showing great leadership. I know there's friction, but overall, from where I'm sitting, you guys are doing a great job, and it's going to make a tremendous difference.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6312646" data-originallang="en">This is the last one before I get into my stuff. I have to believe that lurking out there somewhere, not far behind Matt, is my former right hand, Tyler Crosby. Assuming that he's out there somewhere, I give a shout-out to Tyler and a thanks for everything that he did for me.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6312647" data-originallang="en">Now I'll go on to why we're actually here: PACP.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6312648" data-originallang="en"> I have to tell you that I am impressed. I am impressed because normally, now that I'm doing some work with CAAF and travelling around more to jurisdictions, one of the most difficult things is to convince politicians that they need training because, of course, we know everything when we're politicians. Nobody can tell us what to do. That's why we're here: to get rid of that old nonsense and bring in the new and the fresh. The reality is that you get it. Every one of you, from what I've heard, is seeking more training, and that is brilliant, because in my opinion, it shows that you're starting from exactly where you need to be.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6312649" data-originallang="en">Lesley asked you what you thought about this committee. Oftentimes, it's thought of like the library committee, especially by the whips, and not like health, environment, finance or trade; no, it was some of that other stuff. I was in Parliament for 15 years, and I know darn well that the public accounts committee in many ways was seen in the same way as the library committee. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6312650" data-originallang="en">The fact that the whips are there at all means two things. First, it helps instill the importance of this committee, but also, through the training, I hope you'll come to realize that if PACP is doing its job right, whips do not have the same influence on its members as they do on other committees because, as has been stated by Lesley and Carol, you're in a completely different universe. This is not like any other committee you've been on. The sole responsibility of this committee is to provide the premier oversight for the spending of taxpayers' money by rooting out waste and supporting efficiency.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6312651" data-originallang="en"> That's what you do, and you have the power to make that happen, but you heard about that reputation that flowed from the last Parliament because at every meeting we worked really hard at making sure that our party membership was left at the door and that when we came in, we were a team. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6312652" data-originallang="en">Chair, I want to say to you that your role here is way more important than it is in other committees, because in other committees you're often just the traffic cop dealing with the presenters and the witnesses. You're going to find, especially when you get into report writing when you're in camera and it's just the group, just the team, that they're going to look to you to be the one to help them when they're at loggerheads. Sometimes it's done with humour. Sometimes it's done with the gravitas of the chair. Sometimes it's done with the chair taking their shoe off and smacking the table à la Khrushchev.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6312653" data-originallang="en"> Whatever it takes, Chair, your job, in my view, is to promote and protect the culture and to see yourself as a team leader, not the Conservative chair of a standing committee. You are the team leader of the premier oversight mechanism for the entire federal government of a G7 country. That's a big deal, and it's a lot of responsibility for you, but I know you: You're a veteran, and I know you can do this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6312654" data-originallang="en"> That's why it means so much to me that the chair that I think we made some of the greatest advances under was Kevin Sorenson. Going back, I think Dean would agree that John Williams played a major role and was a mentor to all of us. Back in the day, he was “Mr. Public Accounts”. He led that team, and that team was a team. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6312655" data-originallang="en">You're going to break down sometimes and slide into partisanship. Fight it to get back. Please, I implore all of you, do not let public accounts hearings become a rerun of what you did at question period. Carol made a reference to that. When you do that, it may get a headline and it may get you a quote in the lead story of the day, but you've let Parliament down, because Parliament is looking to this committee to do that job, and that job can only be done if you're not being partisan. When you're partisan, yes, you benefit and you get the headline or you're part of the story, but you've completely blown up the culture of the committee, and it's the culture that gives it the strength, the respect and the awareness that you need to work together. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6312656" data-originallang="en">The fact is that you are the only entity other than cabinet that can hold departments to account. The AG can only point things out, but it's the politicians who can say, “You shall do this, and you shall do it by this time period, and you will report back to us at this time period as to how well you're progressing.” That's why, when you have someone like Dillan, who is just a crackerjack at grabbing all these things, you're going to find that he and Angela are going to be such a help when you're doing report writing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6312657" data-originallang="en">I'm going to jump around a bit because I always use up my time, and I know I'm going to lose it here. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6312658" data-originallang="en">When you have reports reflecting that the opposition is opposed to something and the government is in favour of it, or the other way around, when you issue that report, everybody looks at it and says, “Oh, the government is where you would expect the government to be and the opposition members are where you expect them to be, so what am I really going to get out of reading this report except two versions of different rants?” You're going to go months when nobody even knows you exist, and then you're going to wake up one morning and you're front and centre for days in a row because of what's going on in terms of the reports that are in front of you. It's not like that with all of them, but enough of them. They're huge. What is powerful, especially when you have a big audit, and the thing that helps Parliament and helps the Canadian people, is if you go in camera and you come to a unanimous agreement. If the government deserves to be criticized, then that language is in there.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6312659" data-originallang="en"> When you're in camera, in the give and take, the government members, in a perfect world, are going to say, “Look, we accept that the government screwed up, and the audit reflects that and our report is going to reflect that, but come on—give me a break on the language. Really, I can't accept that language.” Then, from the other side, respect that the government members are willing to provide some criticism, but be careful of the wording. Listen to what they're saying. Work at the wordsmithing. This is where Dillan is so fantastic at coming up with not only alternative language, but sometimes a completely different approach that lets you keep the points you're making but allows you to get through the part where you got stuck.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6312660" data-originallang="en">Chair, any time your committee is issuing a unanimous report, you've hit a home run. If it's divided, it's not your fault, but the committee wasn't as effective as it could have been. I would ask my colleagues, when they take the floor, if they can think of any reports that weren't unanimous; I know we always worked toward unanimity. Kevin, in the last one, I think we did it all the way.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6312661" data-originallang="en">Anyway, I'm going to jump around. I have a couple more points that I really want to get out. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6312662" data-originallang="en">First, you've already heard about CAAF. In full disclosure, I need to declare to you that I'm on the board of directors and I do some work for them. Long before then, CAAF was our right hand. In fact, in questioning, you might want to talk about some work we did when they analyzed how we reviewed the public accounts themselves, and it was the first time in the world that it had been done. CAAF is critically important.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6312663" data-originallang="en">Another one is the CCPAC. You heard Lesley make reference to it, and Carol too. It's the Canadian Council of Public Accounts Committees. Number one, it's the only real chance you're going to get to travel, and it's great, because you move from province to province. I cannot urge enough for all the members—and, Chair, you in particular—to be at that conference, because as Lesley has alluded to, the rest of the country looks to the feds. You're the most powerful, you have the most capacity, you have the most experience and you're on the world stage. The provinces and territories will look to you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6312664" data-originallang="en"> Chair, though you're new, they don't expect you to know all the answers, but what they want to hear is that there's a continuation happening at the federal level of the culture that the committee under the leadership of Kevin Sorenson was able to bring. To me, that's just textbook; that last public accounts committee was as good as I've ever seen, and probably as good as it gets. Therefore, I urge you to participate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6312665" data-originallang="en">The other group, the third acronym, is CPA, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. They're all parliaments. It's the former Empire Parliamentary Association. Now we're linked together through a commonwealth organization. They now have the Commonwealth Association of Public Accounts Committees. It started two or three years ago. Kevin and I were there for the founding of CAPAC. It has gone through some variations and is still trying to find its legs, but I urge you to keep your eye on it, and if they're holding any more conferences, that's the other travel that you should do. We did that. We went to London, England, once to visit the public accounts committee. We came back with some amazing ideas, some of which are in the legacy report that we left, ideas that we hadn't got around to that we learned from there.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6312666" data-originallang="en">To wrap all this up, remember, I'm a guy with a grade 9 education, so if this was about being smart with numbers and knowing auditing and having a great academic background, I couldn't even start to do the work, but it is not; the auditors do that. Your job—our job—is the political part, and that's the key thing you do. When I started going to the Canadian Council of Public Accounts Committees, I began to see a bigger world. I began to realize that this is a big thing. There are literally hundreds of thousands of people—such as Carol, such as our new Auditor General and such as Lesley Burns—who dedicate their professional lives to the issue of transparency and accountability and its role in strengthening democracy. I first got a flavour for that, my first sip of the Kool-Aid, when I went to CCPAC. Every year, I took a bit more Kool-Aid, and a bit more, and by the end, I was bringing my own Thermoses of Kool-Aid, because I bought in.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6312667" data-originallang="en">It is a key component of any democracy. Some of you will know that I've travelled the world and have done a number of international election observation missions, so I know some of the fundamentals of what makes a strong democracy. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6312668" data-originallang="en">Chair, I see your eyes. I'm getting ready to close.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6312669" data-originallang="en">The work that you do is critical. Just know that you're entering a whole world of people who are committed to strengthening democracy through transparency and accountability. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6312670" data-originallang="en"> I thank you, Chair.</p>
