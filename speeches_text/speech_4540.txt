<p data-HoCid="8479406" data-originallang="fr">In your opinion, could something be done to largely satisfy the needs of the Islamic community and the Jewish community in Canada? Obviously, I'm not talking about conflicts abroad. Although we all suffer from them, we may have less power in that respect. What could be done here, in Quebec and Canada, to improve the situation for both the Jewish and Islamic communities?</p>
