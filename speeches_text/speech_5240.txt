<p data-HoCid="8690900" data-originallang="en"> One of my personal beliefs is that volunteerism is very important. I tried to instill that in my own kids. A friend of mine and I were having a beer one night and chatting about the lack of education for farm kidsâ€”specifically, the business part of it. A lot of farm kids know how to run the tractors, grow the wheat and bale the hay. What they don't know are all the laws behind labour and all the business components.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8690901" data-originallang="en"> We developed a course and went down this rabbit hole for three years, and then we pitched it to Algonquin College. After another three years, it became an actual program that exists at the Perth campus now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8690902" data-originallang="en">Yes, there needs to be a lot of work to allow farmers to do succession planning and get out. I also think we need to better educate some of the young people to come in.</p>
