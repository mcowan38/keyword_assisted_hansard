<p data-HoCid="7345526" data-originallang="en">I in no way meant to suggest that anti-Semitism should not be taken seriously. Quite the contrary, in many years of my adult life I have spent time fighting anti-Semitism, fighting Islamophobia, fighting racism on the ground working with community members from various communities, so I take this extremely seriously and I would encourage you to revisit my remarks on this matter on a number of occasions. I disagree with you, with respect, sir.</p>

We trusted at that time that the adequate vetting had been completed, and, as we have said, this individual fell through the cracks and that is why I'm here today, to assure members that we're putting in place significant measures to ensure this never happens again. </p>
