<p data-HoCid="7936305" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, it is a great honour to speak today at this unique sitting. Unfortunately, I am unable to attend in person.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936306" data-originallang="en">Because of my inability to be on an airplane at this point in my life due to having had a stroke, and I am, as you see, recovering quite well, I cannot participate in person, which means I also cannot vote, which is a terrible shame. I am participating this way because I want to make sure this election for the Speaker takes into account what I think are the essential elements for the next Speaker of the House.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936307" data-originallang="fr">We must follow our rules.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936308" data-originallang="en">For me, this is essential. If you walk down the back corridor behind the Speaker's chair, you will see the portraits of former Speakers. I do think you should pause in front of the portrait of Lucien Lamoureux, who served this place from 1966 to 1974. He was the best of all of our Speakers. He personified nonpartisanship. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7936309" data-originallang="en">Elected as a Liberal in the government of Lester B. Pearson, when Lucien Lamoureux ran for re-election as a sitting Speaker, he did so twice as an independent. He also applied our rules, which meant he was not always popular, and he was not elected. He was able to enforce the rules. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7936310" data-originallang="en">Everyone who has spoken has said our rules are important, but on a daily basis we ignore Standing Orders 16 and 18, which require that we respect one another and that we treat each other with respect.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936311" data-originallang="fr">I completely agree with my colleague, the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278395" href="/politicians/greg-fergus/" title="Greg Fergus">Hull—Aylmer</a>. Respect is of the utmost importance. However, we have made it a habit to flout our rules.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936312" data-originallang="en">We ignore our rules at our peril. I cite the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278667" href="/politicians/anthony-rota/" title="Anthony Rota">Nipissing—Timiskaming</a> for his service, and the tragedy that unfolded in this place could have been avoided if we had followed our rules.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936313" data-originallang="fr">There are rules about recognizing visitors in the galleries. In this case, it is clear that the rules were broken in acknowledging that man's presence.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936314" data-originallang="en">I know that because I tried to convince the former Speaker to recognize someone whom I thought did deserve recognition in our gallery, only to be told that Dr. David Suzuki did not qualify, so I know the rules represent a steep hill to climb to have someone recognized in the gallery. I cannot imagine how this happened, but I also agree words are not enough. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7936315" data-originallang="en">That moment in this House brought back the words of the late Irving Abella, who said that in our history it was easier to gain entry to Canada as a Nazi than as a Jew. I think we have to do more than say we are sorry. I think we have to atone and open up the records of the Deschênes commission. We have to look at our history, just as we do on the day of truth and reconciliation for the injustices and genocide toward indigenous peoples.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936316" data-originallang="fr">We must follow our rules.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936317" data-originallang="en">The Speaker's role is essential, as the Speaker is the only person who can decide who speaks in question period. It has been 40 years that the Speaker has broken the rules every single day, regardless what Speaker we are talking about, by accepting a list from a party whip that tells him or her who speaks and in what order. That abomination has moved the system of rewards and punishments from the Speaker to the party whip. The party whips are not the people we want to please if we want this place to operate with respect and to make Canadians look at the House of Commons and think, “There is a place I respect; that is democracy in action.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936318" data-originallang="fr">We can try harder and we can do better. It is possible.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936319" data-originallang="en">All of those running in this election are more than qualified to be good Speakers of the House. If it were my honour to fill that role, I cannot tell you how overwhelmed I would be. However, I think it is not likely, and I encourage you to vote for the person you think will be your best Speaker.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936320" data-originallang="en">I pledge my support to the next Speaker, whoever is brave enough to go back to following our rule that only the Speaker chooses who speaks in question period. This was confirmed when the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278258" href="/politicians/andrew-scheer/" title="Andrew Scheer">Regina—Qu'Appelle</a> was the Speaker of the House, in April 2013 on a point of order from the late Mark Warawa. It would no doubt improve our proceedings enormously.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936321" data-originallang="en">With that, I wish you all the best of luck.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936322" data-originallang="fr">Good luck to all of my colleagues who are hoping to be the next Speaker. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7936323" data-originallang="en">I miss you all and cannot wait to see you all again. You know I love you all. I really miss you and want to give you a big hug.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936324" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much. I wish you the best of luck. God bless you.</p>
