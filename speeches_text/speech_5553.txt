<p data-HoCid="8716940" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, today I rise to commemorate World Day for the Prevention of and Healing from Child Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Violence, a day that demands our unwavering commitment to protecting the most vulnerable in our communities. As a member of the Subcommittee on International Human Rights, I heard devastating testimonies from hundreds of NGOs. These organizations are working in over 190 countries and territories worldwide, and they have revealed the brutal realities that children face in conflict zones.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8716941" data-originallang="en"> Today we continue working together to advocate for children facing crisis around the world, including in Sudan, Palestine, Ukraine and too many more. Since 2016, Canada has contributed millions in humanitarian funding, but financial support alone is not enough. We must strengthen international protocols, enhance legal protections and create better support systems for children at risk. Every child in Canada and across the world deserves safety, dignity and an opportunity to dream.</p>
