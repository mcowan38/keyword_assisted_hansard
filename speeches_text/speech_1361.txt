<p data-HoCid="6955970" data-originallang="en">Since the tweets by one of the NDP members have come up, I want to make it very clear that her tweet in no way reflected the position of the New Democratic Party. I've spoken to our leader, <a data-HoCid="278714" href="/politicians/jagmeet-singh/" title="Jagmeet Singh">Jagmeet Singh</a>, many times, and our support for the Ukrainian people and Ukrainian Canadians is unwavering. I believe that <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Ms. Gazan</a> has retracted that statement. Certainly it is something that I deeply regret, and I can reiterate our support for the Ukrainian Canadian people.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6955971" data-originallang="en">I know I don't have very much time, but I have a last question, for Mr. Browder. Could you talk a bit about the other countries that have been using Magnitsky sanctions in a more appropriate way? They have been using them more frequently. What would you like to see Canada do, and what actions would you like to see this committee move forward on? I know that's a lot to ask in a short time, so good luck.</p>
