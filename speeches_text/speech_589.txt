<p data-HoCid="6479856" data-originallang="en">I just wanted to speak in support of the meeting with Jesse Thistle and the second hour with CMHC, which is the rapid housing initiative. There was a comment from my colleague, MP Gazan. She was hoping to have the <a data-HoCid="253372" href="/politicians/ahmed-hussen/" title="Ahmed Hussen">minister</a> appear, so the CMHC for one hour and the minister for one hour. I'm just wondering if we could adapt the schedule to make sure that's included. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6479857" data-originallang="en">Also, just maybe as a point of clarification because I am filling in, is there no steering committee? Is the committee business on February 2 going to be a whole two-hour session, or do you do a steering committee? Then that could be a shorter time and then potentially we could have the <a data-HoCid="253372" href="/politicians/ahmed-hussen/" title="Ahmed Hussen">minister</a> for the second hour.</p>
