<p data-HoCid="8347846" data-originallang="en"> If I can, I'll make two points on this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8347847" data-originallang="en">Firstly, we're very happy to see the policy with the regional focus on the Arctic, as are our allies. This has been a regional vulnerability, especially for our U.S. allies. Speaking to the chair of the military committee of NATO last week, they're very happy as well. That's our regional focus.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8347848" data-originallang="en">Given what we're facing as a globally integrated threat environment, if we have wider war in Europe with NATO and if there is war in Asia, it's going to be across the globe. The Arctic is now an area of competition, and potentially conflict, so the regional focus on that part is well received.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8347849" data-originallang="en">The second piece in the document is discussion about the integrated air and missile defence, which is absolutely the way to go forward. The clearest, starkest example of this is what happened 48 hours ago in Israel, with multiple types of weapons being shot against the country—several types of drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles—and the integrated nature of the response, with aircraft, ground-based air defence of various types, ship-based air defence and the command-and-control system that brought them together.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8347850" data-originallang="en">We have some investments here and through NORAD modernization in the sensors that are required. Mrs. Gallant talked about the pan-domain command and control that's going to be required to bring it all together.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8347851" data-originallang="en"> This concept, as we go forward for continental defence, is increasingly important, not just here in North America but also with respect to our commitments in NATO and in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
