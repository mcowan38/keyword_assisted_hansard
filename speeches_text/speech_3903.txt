<p data-HoCid="8303082" data-originallang="en"> Welcome back to meeting number 110 of the procedure and House affairs committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303083" data-originallang="en">I had mentioned earlier that this was the first time we were studying this matter, but it is actually the second time. I was mistaken.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303084" data-originallang="en"> With that, we're really excited to have our next panel. Appearing as an individual is Professor Lubomyr Luciuk, department of political science, Royal Military College of Canada. We also have with us Richard Marceau, vice-president, external affairs and general counsel, Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303085" data-originallang="en">As we've been working out the calendar, we've had some changes. You have my apologies that we have had to reschedule you a couple of times, which means the opening comments time has varied and changed. Because we have done that, I will be providing some leniency. I will let you for the most part go on with your comments. When you see me starting to wave, I would like them to come to an end, but at the same time, you are our guests and we really appreciate your taking the time to be here with us today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303086" data-originallang="en">With that, Professor, we'll start with you. The floor is yours. Welcome to PROC.</p>
