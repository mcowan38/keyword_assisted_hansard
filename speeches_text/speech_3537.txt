<p data-HoCid="8202313" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the Senate amendments to Bill <a data-HoCid="11538831" href="/bills/44-1/C-234/" title="An Act to amend the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act">C-234</a> have drastically changed the contents of the original bill that this House passed with support from multiple parties. It would basically have reduced the tax bill for farmers by about a billion dollars, savings that would have been passed on to my constituents whose greatest relationship with farmers is when they go to the grocery store to buy Canadian produce, Canadian goods that they need to eat. Now these things will not be cheaper because the government seems intent on making sure amendments that the government engineered on the so-called independent Liberal senators are now being reflected in a bill that would remove exemptions for barns and greenhouses, and changes the original sunset clause.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8202314" data-originallang="en">That is pretty typical of the government's actions. It does by stealth what should be done in public, transparently. The government should own the changes it is making to the legislation, but it does not want to do that. I would be embarrassed as well if I were trying to take food out of the mouths of people all over the country. Food banks have reported record-high numbers of Canadians using them to feed their families. The bill before us was intended to lower the cost of groceries.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8202315" data-originallang="en"> For all of those people in the riding of Calgary Shepard who are going to be watching this, I say that the bill would lower their bills. It would lower grocery bills. It would lower their Costco bill. People go to the East Hills Costco or the Heritage Costco. Many people in my riding go to the Okotoks Costco because it is actually closer than most of the other Costco stores and grocery stores in my area. However, the Liberals seem to be fully intent on making sure that the carbon tax has the maximum impact on the monthly budget of my constituents, for the worse, not for the better.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8202316" data-originallang="en">None of these farmers gets a rebate of any sort to offset some of the costs of their farm operations. That is the economic damage that the Parliamentary Budget Officer calculated. Even with the rebates, everybody in Alberta is going to be worse off, or is worse off as of now, because of the carbon tax.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8202317" data-originallang="en">The bill would not address that, but it would at least relieve some of the pain that farmers are feeling. Some of them have a thousand dollars or tens of thousands of dollars extra per month in bills; it depends on the particular farm operation. What we know is that the vast majority of farmers are supplying goods, produce and food, that people in Canada are going to eat, and they are going to be more expensive unless the bill passes without the terrible Senate amendments.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8202318" data-originallang="en">We have heard other members say that the <a data-HoCid="278910" href="/politicians/steven-guilbeault/" title="Steven Guilbeault">environment minister</a> made phone calls to senators. The <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, according to media reports, was reaching out to so-called independent Liberal senators to get them to amend the bill and force it back to the House, delaying it and therefore delaying lower grocery prices in our stores.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8202319" data-originallang="en">After eight long years, people in my riding just cannot afford this anymore. They cannot afford the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>'s carbon tax. The rebate is not helping in any way, shape or form. We know from the Parliamentary Budget Officer, as I said, that bills are up; they are higher, and it is doing damage to the economy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8202320" data-originallang="en">The Liberals seem to think that he who cannot pay should learn to pray, to paraphrase a Yiddish proverb. That is essentially what they are saying to everybody in my riding and to every single farmer out there who is now going to be struggling to figure out how they can make their farm operation profitable for another year. How can they keep it running to be able to pass it on to their kids for the next generation? Is it even worth it? Countless members of the House have given examples of farmers who are set to give up. They just do not see how they can make their farm operation work with crushing bills that continue to get higher.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8202321" data-originallang="en">I hope everybody is learning how to pray, because that is essentially the message the Liberal government is sending to everyone. The Liberals just do not care. They are fine with putting a $1-billion bill on the backs of farmers, expecting them to pass it on to consumers. Consumers will then do the logical thing when they cannot afford food: They are going to buy less food, and then they are going to go to the food bank to make up the difference, because they have to eat. It is a necessity, so that is what is going to happen. They seem to be fine with that on that side of the House.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8202322" data-originallang="en">I thought there had been consensus that the original version of Bill <a data-HoCid="11538831" href="/bills/44-1/C-234/" title="An Act to amend the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act">C-234</a> was the right bill and that this House had told the Senate that we wanted it in a particular format. On spending and tax matters, it is not up to the Senate to tell us, the representatives of the people, elected every four to five years depending when the federal elections are, that people do not get the credit, tax relief or spending measures we wanted.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8202323" data-originallang="en">That is not the Senate's job. Its job, when it comes to bills such as this on the reduction of costs, on taxes and on tax credits, and especially getting rid of the carbon tax, should be to get out of the way. This House should vote down these Senate amendments. We should go back to the original version of Bill <a data-HoCid="11538831" href="/bills/44-1/C-234/" title="An Act to amend the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act">C-234</a>, and the Senate should pass it expeditiously.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8202324" data-originallang="en">I have not had a single constituent tell me that they think it is a great idea to keep paying high grocery bills. Nobody has told me that Bill <a data-HoCid="11538831" href="/bills/44-1/C-234/" title="An Act to amend the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act">C-234</a> should have serious amendments to eliminate things such as barn heating and greenhouses. They would also question, and many residents in my riding have, such things as why people with home heating oil in eastern Canada get a discount, but people in my riding who heat with natural gas do not get one on their natural gas bills or their really high carbon tax bills.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8202325" data-originallang="en">They see the politicization of this and the temporary nature of the heating oil suspension on the carbon tax, which is now very similar to what is going to happen with these Senate amendments in Bill <a data-HoCid="11538831" href="/bills/44-1/C-234/" title="An Act to amend the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act">C-234</a>. In three years, it would go back up. Even if this passes, what happens then? There could be a federal election by then. This is essentially the same game the government is playing, but it is using its so-called independent Liberal senators to get through this difficult period. We see it in the polls.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8202326" data-originallang="en">I see the polls too. I do not pay attention to them very closely; the only ones that matter are those on voting day. However, I know the Liberals are probably panicking. They are about 16 or 19 points behind, depending on the poll one looks at. Farmers and people in my riding, and there is a great Yiddish word for it, are <em>farharghet</em>. It is a way to say exhausted and worn out. They are worn out by this debate on the carbon tax. It is obviously causing damage throughout the economy, and it has raised the prices of basic goods and necessities. They are <em>farharghet</em>; they are tired of having this debate continue when we know that people want the tax to be axed. They want the carbon tax to go away in full.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8202327" data-originallang="en">The Liberals refuse to do that. I invite them to call a federal election. Let us have one right now. We will call it the “axe-the-tax election”, and Canadians can make up their minds. They can decide which side is correct. Do they want high grocery prices or not? In the meantime, we should get rid of these Senate amendments, send the bill back to the other place and have it pass the original bill. It is a tax-and-spend measure. Constitutionally, the Senate has no right to do this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8202328" data-originallang="en"> I have a lot of ranchers and farmers who actually choose to retire in my riding. It is an affordable place to live compared with some other places in Alberta and throughout Canada. A lot of the condos are actually filled with farmers who retired to be closer to their families. Their farm operations continue with their kids, but they have chosen to retire somewhere small. Their daughters and their sons continue the operations. They like to travel. They have earned it. After 30 or 40 years of farming or ranching, they have earned a bit of rest.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8202329" data-originallang="en">Everybody back home in my riding of Calgary Shepard, and throughout Calgary, should all start calling senators and members of Parliament. They do not have to call me; I am already convinced. I am good. I will vote the way my constituents want. However, they should be calling Liberal and NDP members of Parliament in Alberta, and they should let their views be known politely. They should tell their friends, co-workers and suppliers to call MPs and senators, telling them to pass this bill without the Senate amendments and return it to the original version.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8202330" data-originallang="en">Taxpayers, Canadian voters and farmers deserve a billion-dollar break on their bills, on their groceries, at the end of the month. Grocery prices will come down thanks to bills such as Bill <a data-HoCid="11538831" href="/bills/44-1/C-234/" title="An Act to amend the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act">C-234</a>, and it has to happen. As I said, my constituents are<em>farharghet</em>. It is an exhausting debate to keep having to convince Liberal MPs and the others in the coalition, the NDP, that this will lead to lower grocery prices; the carbon tax has been punishing them for years now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8202331" data-originallang="en">I hope members on the other side will see the righteousness of the cause, pray on it and vote down these Senate amendments.</p>
