<p data-HoCid="8434945" data-originallang="en"> Thank you for the question because it gives me the opportunity to talk about the handbook on the IHRA definition that we hope to be releasing in June. There will be a clear explanation and interpretation of how the IHRA definition needs to be used to underpin all of our anti-Semitism training. You're quite correct to point out that, even as some of our people try to make adjustments and improvements, we are still not where we need to be. Again, there's hard work that needs to be done.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8434946" data-originallang="en"> I believe the commitment is there. I know that the new anti-racism strategy 2.0 will be launched soon. We know that the government is looking at announcing their action plan combatting hate. All of these provide an opportunity for an intensive campaign, not just across the federal government but provincially and municipally, to ensure that anti-Semitism well understood.</p>
