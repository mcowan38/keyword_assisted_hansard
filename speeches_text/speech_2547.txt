<p data-HoCid="7953248" data-originallang="en">One thing that we've done through analyzing decades of CFIA data is take a close look at the things that result in biosecurity threats and diseases, and oftentimes it tends to be poor practices on farms or poor adherence to practices that are voluntary. For instance, there have been numerous studies in the dairy sector, in the chicken sector, on mink farms and on rabbit farms that have shown that people are not really following the rules closely when researchers put up cameras to monitor their behaviour.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7953249" data-originallang="en">One thing that we are advocating.... When the last iteration of this bill, <a data-HoCid="10866025" href="/bills/43-2/C-205/" title="An Act to amend the Health of Animals Act">Bill C-205</a>, was discussed at this committee two years ago, it was amended to do a couple of things, and I think those amendments would be productive in this case.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7953250" data-originallang="en">The first amendment struck the term “without lawful authority or excuse”. It made this bill apply to anyone who was on a farm who introduced a biosecurity threat, and that's important because we know that the vast majority of biosecurity threats come from people who have regular access to farms. They could be workers, operators or people coming and going with permission. They're not people who are there unlawfully.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7953251" data-originallang="en">That's what we would suggest.</p>
