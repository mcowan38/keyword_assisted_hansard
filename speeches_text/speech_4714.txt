<p data-HoCid="8565871" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8565872" data-originallang="en"> Thank you to our committee members for bringing forward this pre-emptive motion, I'll say. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8565873" data-originallang="en">I say that because we know that <a data-HoCid="300005" href="/politicians/randy-boissonnault/" title="Randy Boissonnault">Minister Boissonnault</a>, who is the Minister for Employment, Workforce Development and Official Languages, is coming to this committee on Thursday. I know that all of us have a lot of questions to ask the minister, including me and everybody here at this committee. We've been given the opportunity to do so, as is the right of this committee. I am very glad that the minister has been forthcoming to come forward and answer all of these questions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8565874" data-originallang="en">I find this motion pre-emptive because perhaps it would make more sense if this was presented after the minister has come, given his testimony and answered all of the questions. This motion is pre-emptive and lists a lot of people I'm not familiar with. I'm not sure about my colleagues, but it's pre-emptive because it seems like it is a fishing expedition.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8565875" data-originallang="en"> We have spent a lot of time and government and House resources trying to go down this rabbit hole with the Conservatives as they lead us down this path. In the interest of transparency and in the interest of upholding our ethics and the values of this committee, we on the Liberal side have gone along with it, but at what point, Chair, do we say, “Enough”? At what point is it safe to say, “There are no fish in this lake”? </p>
<p data-HoCid="8565876" data-originallang="en">What this motion really represents is an underlying continued aggression against our Ethics Commissioner, against our democratic values and what this institution, Parliament, represents. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8565877" data-originallang="en"> I say that because I watched the mover of this motion in the industry committee yesterday being shut down, question after question after question, by the Ethics Commissioner. All of this was posed in the industry committee and put forward to the Ethics Commissioner, and the Ethics Commissioner outright said that there's no investigation here and that there has been no violation. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8565878" data-originallang="en">My understanding here is that, if you can't get it right in one committee, let's come to another one and try and try again until something gives. Unfortunately, Mr. Chair, what that ultimately ends up doing is wasting the resources of the House and wasting the resources of this committee. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8565879" data-originallang="en">As I have said today, as I have said for months and months and months, week after week, there are very important studies for us to start working on in this committee. They include misinformation and disinformation campaigns. They include the impact of social media on our young people and on Canadians at large. They include how the Lobbying Act impacts public officials or the people we have contact with and, as we discussed earlier today, issues of how to strengthen the regulations of our Ethics Commissioner and how he governs himself and his office. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8565880" data-originallang="en">There are ways for us to move forward. There are ways for us to conduct our business in an effective manner, business that matters to Canadians, business that has a direct impact in each and every household of Canadians, and this is not it. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8565881" data-originallang="en">We're talking about no less than four meetings, when you just finished telling this whole committee, Chair, that you couldn't spend the next three meetings talking about one of the biggest issues not just in Canada but across the world in all democratic states, which is disinformation campaigns. We just discussed how it is not appropriate for us to go and study this issue because of “timing”, yet I'm sitting here looking at this motion saying, “no less than four meetings”. Why? </p>
<p data-HoCid="8565882" data-originallang="en">Why are we spending all of this time when the Ethics Commissioner very clearly has told the opposition quite unabashedly in the industry committee and otherwise that there is no investigation? Why are we wasting House resources and time? Why are we trying to go on a fishing expedition while ignoring some of the most critical issues of our time? They include misinformation and disinformation. They include our democratic institutions and the perception and trust that we have within them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8565883" data-originallang="en">Chair, this motion is pre-emptive as I've said. It has no place to be discussed today. If anything, I encourage Mr. Cooper to bring this forward after <a data-HoCid="300005" href="/politicians/randy-boissonnault/" title="Randy Boissonnault">Minister Boissonnault</a> has come to this committee to testify and has answered all of the questions that any of these members would have. Go from there.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8565884" data-originallang="en"> Again, I come back to my original point. Why is this brought in today when we know that the <a data-HoCid="300005" href="/politicians/randy-boissonnault/" title="Randy Boissonnault">minister</a> is coming in on Thursday? If we are being genuine, then why not pose all of these questions to the minister and then whatever is left over you bring forward in a motion to say, “All right, these are the questions that I don't have answers to and I want answers to.” We've had answers from so many different committees, from so many different witnesses. Again, we'll refer to the industry committee yesterday, where Mr. Cooper got told off by the Ethics Commissioner who said something like “What are you doing, buddy, and why?” </p>
<p data-HoCid="8565885" data-originallang="en">It doesn't make sense to me. Again, I'm happy to go down their rabbit hole, but I don't want to do it pre-emptively. I think that we need some time to really question the <a data-HoCid="300005" href="/politicians/randy-boissonnault/" title="Randy Boissonnault">minister</a>, who is coming before us on Thursday, to ask our questions to our hearts' content and then to re-evaluate as to whether we are effectively using House resources, whether we are doing something that is going to benefit Canadians, or we are taking away from what Canadians can really benefit from, which is a study on misinformation and disinformation, which is a study on social media, which is a study on the Lobbying Act and perhaps the conflict of interest code, etc., to see how we can better reframe ourselves to build that public trust and to protect the public in these times of artificial intelligence, social media and a lack of privacy for individual Canadians as well. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8565886" data-originallang="en"> We try our very best to ensure that there's transparency within our government institutions and public institutions, and we try to protect Canadians along the way.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8565887" data-originallang="en">l will say again that this motion is very pre-emptive. I think we should wait until the <a data-HoCid="300005" href="/politicians/randy-boissonnault/" title="Randy Boissonnault">minister</a> has testified before we revisit this motion, and go from there.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8565888" data-originallang="en"> I'll park my comments there, Chair. Thank you.</p>
