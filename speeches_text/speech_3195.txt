<p data-HoCid="8124687" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Mr. Chair and members of the committee. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8124688" data-originallang="en">I want to thank you for the invitation to brief the committee today on recent events in Israel, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. The situation is developing quickly, and I will focus on how the conflict is evolving and Canada's response.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8124689" data-originallang="en">While there had been a pause in hostilities from November 22 to November 29, the agreement expired last Friday, and sadly, fighting has resumed. The seven-day truce had been a positive step in the right direction that enabled the release of 110 hostages and allowed many families to be reunited. The pause also permitted the accelerated delivery of humanitarian assistance into Gaza, including fuel and cooking oil, as well as food, water and medical supplies. As the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> has stated, the Government of Canada is urging maximum restraint and is calling for more pauses in hostilities. An increased, sustained and unimpeded delivery of aid into Gaza is critically urgent, as is the unconditional and immediate release of all hostages held by Hamas.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8124690" data-originallang="fr">Canada continues to engage with its partners in the region and around the world.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8124691" data-originallang="fr">We have underscored the fact that we support Israel's right under international law to defend itself against Hamas's terrorist acts. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8124692" data-originallang="fr">As the government has stated both publicly and privately, Israel must defend itself in accordance with the rules of international humanitarian law. The first such rule is the protection of civilians. All actors must comply with international humanitarian law. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8124693" data-originallang="en">The humanitarian situation in Gaza remains a significant concern for the government. The latest reports indicate that nearly 1.8 million Palestinians have been displaced from their homes since October 7. It is estimated that at least 15,000 have been killed, a large portion of whom are civilians and children. It is impossible for us to independently verify those figures, but there's no doubt that many innocent Palestinian civilians continue to suffer deeply. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8124694" data-originallang="en">The humanitarian assistance that has been allowed into Gaza thus far is progress. However, it is clear that much more is needed to address the urgent humanitarian needs of Palestinian civilians. Canadian officials continue to call on all parties to ensure the continued safe, unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid, including food, fuel, water and medicine, into Gaza so that life-saving assistance reaches those who need it most. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8124695" data-originallang="en">Canada remains one of the largest contributors of humanitarian and development assistance to vulnerable Palestinians, with an average spend of $55 million per year. With regard to the current crisis in Gaza, Canada's contribution stands at $60 million, including a matching fund of $13.7 million that leveraged the generosity of Canadians. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8124696" data-originallang="en">All our funding to support Palestinians goes through trusted partner organizations, such as UN agencies and the Turkish Red Crescent, to name a couple. We will support their efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance while ensuring that none of the funding goes into the hands of Hamas. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8124697" data-originallang="en">Canada exercises enhanced due diligence for all humanitarian and development assistance funding for Palestinians. This effort includes a systematic screening process and strong anti-terrorism provisions in funding agreements. It is critical that we emphasize that Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people, nor their legitimate aspirations. It has not advanced the well-being of the people it claims to represent. It chose to attack Israel, where it committed atrocities, murdered innocent civilians and took hostages, in total violation of all international laws and norms. Hamas is a terrorist organization.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8124698" data-originallang="en">Turning briefly to the broader region, it is essential that this conflict not become regionalized and spread to neighbouring areas. In this respect, Iran's rhetoric in support of Hamas, statements by the terrorist group Hezbollah and the launching of rockets into and towards Israel and American forces by actors affiliated with Iran and Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen are all deeply concerning. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8124699" data-originallang="fr">Canadian representatives at all levels are continuing to work with our partners in the region and around the world to deal with the situation. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8124700" data-originallang="fr">The government remains determined to enforce international law and support the right of Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace and security.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8124701" data-originallang="en">In closing, we will continue to support a two-state solution as the long-standing and internationally agreed means to achieve this outcome.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8124702" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
