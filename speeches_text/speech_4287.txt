<p data-HoCid="8435194" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435195" data-originallang="fr">Dr. Kogan, Dr. Butler, Dr. Rosenberg and Dr. Diamond, thank you for being with us today. This is an important study, and your input is equally important.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435196" data-originallang="fr">Dr. Diamond, I would like to pick up on something you said earlier. I really like what you said about freedom of expression not necessarily requiring others to listen. I completely agree with you and I wanted to point that out right away.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435197" data-originallang="fr">Of course, I think we all agree that anti-Semitism is unacceptable. In any case, I don't know anyone who disagrees. We are here to look for ways to improve things. Otherwise, we would simply be talking for the sake of it, which is not very productive. So we are looking for ways to better protect freedom of religion and freedom of expression across Quebec and Canada. This is of concern to me and leads me to a question. If I understand what you are asking for or what the Jewish community is asking for, it is freedom of religion, respect for religious beliefs, in the same way that other religions are respected. I would like to clarify that with you, Dr. Diamond. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8435198" data-originallang="fr">Is that indeed what you are asking for, that everyone should be treated the same way, or are you asking for something specific for the Jewish community?</p>
