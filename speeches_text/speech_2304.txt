<p data-HoCid="7735589" data-originallang="en">I just want to clarify, because I think there is some language....</p>
<p data-HoCid="7735590" data-originallang="en">To my colleague, when we say “in particular”, for us it was prioritizing. “Including” is a good word, too. One feels like it's prioritizing, and one feels more generic, but I think we're on the same page. From a language perspective, I just want to ensure that, and the comments of my colleague, Ms. Gazan, were well taken, too. This is just for clarification for the record. </p>
