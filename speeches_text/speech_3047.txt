<p data-HoCid="8012893" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, as everyone in this room knows, I am always here to work with anyone who wants to do more to fight climate change and with anyone who wants to do more to help Canadian families during these difficult times.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8012894" data-originallang="fr">I am very pleased that the Bloc Québécois recognizes that one of the best ways to fight climate change is to put a price on pollution and help families with the associated costs. That is what we are doing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8012895" data-originallang="fr">I have regular conversations with the <a data-HoCid="278267" href="/politicians/yves-francois-blanchet/" title="Yves-François Blanchet">Bloc Québécois leader</a>, but we have not discussed this subject recently. The last time we spoke was about Israel and the Middle East. It was a very important conversation with other party leaders.</p>
