<p data-HoCid="7988535" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988536" data-originallang="en">I have a couple of questions about some of your testimony in your opening remarks.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988537" data-originallang="en">I note that you said in your opening remarks that Hamas has killed more than 1,300 Israelis. We know where that data comes from. It comes from the Israel Defense Forces and the State of Israel. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7988538" data-originallang="en">Later on in your opening remarks you said, in reference to Palestinian civilians in Gaza who have been killed, that there are reports of 4,000 killed. Where do these reports come from?</p>
