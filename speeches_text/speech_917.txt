<p data-HoCid="6663700" data-originallang="en">That's absolutely what's needed. I said that in our opening remarks.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6663701" data-originallang="en"> We have three buckets of recommendations for immigration writ large. One of them is on that devolution of the immigration selection process both to the provincial level and, more importantly, to the community level.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6663702" data-originallang="en"> What I would say about the rural and northern immigration pilots—11 of them across the country—is that what was really innovative and interesting about those application processes is that a business community, either a chamber or an EcDev, had to lead that application, so it makes sure, again, that the business community is involved. Labour market integration is among the most important considerations, because that's what sets up our immigrants for success, to be sure.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6663703" data-originallang="en">The other point here, and this is crucial moving forward, folks, is labour market assessment. It's not very attractive or headline-grabbing, but we need to know both by sectors and across communities here what is needed, so the devolution is key.</p>
