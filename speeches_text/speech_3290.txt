<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, multiple times we have allowed the Conservatives to bring forward a motion on the carbon tax in this place. Many of them have stood and said in the House today that this is the number one thing they are hearing from their constituents. </p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">I have been thinking about this a lot today, and the number one issue that constituents are reaching out to me about right now is dental care, bar none. Dental care is the number one issue, and I am proud the Liberals are going to support the NDP's call for dental care. The number two issue I am hearing about is the CPP, and we know the Liberals are supporting the CPP. The number three issue, which I have received 150,000 emails about, is a ceasefire for Gaza.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">These are the things my constituents care about. We have two out of three. Can we get three out of three?</p>
