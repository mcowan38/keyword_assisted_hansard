<p data-HoCid="8793992" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8793993" data-originallang="en"> I'll be asking questions of Ms. Majid.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8793994" data-originallang="en">First of all, I want to thank you very much for joining us here today. You bring a critical perspective to this study. I also want to acknowledge the groundbreaking work of the Arab Canadian Lawyers Association around the issue of freedom of expression, particularly your work on anti-Palestinian racism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8793995" data-originallang="en">We know that a number of Palestinians and supporters have decried what they refer to—and what you refer to in your presentation—as the “Palestine exception” to free speech. If we're talking about freedom of expression, we need to be looking at where its limits exist and why. The Palestine exception to free speech describes a dynamic whereby advocacy in defence of the basic humanity of Palestinians is uniquely policed, suppressed and censored.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8793996" data-originallang="en">Can you describe in detail this phenomenon, and why you think so few are willing to take this on?</p>
