<p data-HoCid="8512563" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the last petition is from folks across the Waterloo region who call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in the Middle East, which would include the release of all hostages and political prisoners. They call for an embargo on the provision of munitions and weaponry to Israel. They call for continued funding for UNRWA and for recognizing the Israeli blockade and continued attacks on innocent civilians in Gaza. The petitioners call on the House to work toward Palestinian statehood, for an end to the occupation of Palestinian land and for the House to call for the support of the work of the ICJ and the International Criminal Court.</p>
