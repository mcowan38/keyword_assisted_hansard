<p data-HoCid="8576490" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I said at the outset that I had no intention of playing partisan politics with the matter before us this evening.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576491" data-originallang="fr">However, since I am being asked the question, I will say that what is unfortunate when we start debating whether or not to cut funding to UNRWA, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, is that, ultimately, the people who would be penalized by these decisions are the ones who need our help the most.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576492" data-originallang="fr">In this context, the very question may betray a certain lack of empathy for people in extremely delicate situations. In the context of the evening's debate, I might even say it is appalling, to say the least.</p>
