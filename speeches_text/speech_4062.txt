<p data-HoCid="8396477" data-originallang="en">The next question I have for you, Minister, is around Gaza. We know that last week the United Nations reported that it would take until 2040 to restore the homes devastated in Israel's bombing and ground offensive in Gaza, and that's if the conflict ended today. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8396478" data-originallang="en">We are seeing a crime of “domicide”. The world hasn't seen anything like the unprecedented destruction of housing in Gaza since World War II. We also know that, with the unexploded ordinances and environmental destruction, the land in Gaza is now a significant hazard for rebuilding. In fact, scientists have said that the planet-warming emissions generated during just the first two months of the war in Gaza were greater than the annual carbon footprint of more than 20 of the world's most climate-vulnerable nations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8396479" data-originallang="en"> I asked the government months ago about the plan for the reconstruction of Gaza, and I really want to get an answer. What is the plan of the government? Will you clearly state now that Canada will not accept any solution that denies the right of Gazans to return to their land? What plans have you made for increasing Canadian assistance to help fund the rebuilding of Gaza for Gazans when this war is over? </p>
<p data-HoCid="8396480" data-originallang="en">There is a very deep concern that, as we rebuild Ukraine, as we rebuild Gaza and as we rebuild Sudan, people around the world will suffer if the money going to that rebuilding is coming off their backs, and the people who are living in these communities need support to rebuild their communities.</p>
