<p data-HoCid="8371722" data-originallang="en"> Madam Speaker, I want to start by agreeing with my friend from <a data-HoCid="278728" href="/politicians/adam-van-koeverden/" title="Adam van Koeverden">Milton</a>. Yes, we condemn Hamas. Yes, Hamas must release all hostages. Yes, from his own personal experience, he knows better than most, having seen from his time in Gaza, that things have only gotten worse there in the time since.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8371723" data-originallang="en"> It is also true that it has been six weeks now since this Parliament passed a motion calling on the government that he is a part of to take further action. It has been three months since the International Court of Justice called on the State of Israel to take six immediate steps to prevent acts of genocide.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8371724" data-originallang="en"> It is critical that the Liberal government call on Israel to follow through on that ICJ ruling. Can the member speak, particularly on this night, as we know the invasion of Rafah has begun, to what can and will be done by the current government to call for the ICJ ruling to be followed?</p>
