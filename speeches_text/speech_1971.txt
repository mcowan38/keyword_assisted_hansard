<p data-HoCid="7414858" data-originallang="en">I do agree that a lot has been brought into the room today that is not germane to Bill <a data-HoCid="11668222" href="/bills/44-1/C-18/" title="An Act respecting online communications platforms that make news content available to persons in Canada">C-18,</a> and is not about news organizations and their relationship with news disseminating platforms.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7414859" data-originallang="en">I think we all agree, presumably, that there are many reasons to be critical of big tech. Those do include the algorithmic amplification of inflammatory material. I think that is something that the House is intending to grapple with through online harms legislation. That's a really important issue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7414860" data-originallang="en">I'm on the board of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network. That is what we track: anti-Semitism and hate of various kinds, and racism in Canada, including what's disseminated by the platforms. It's an important issue. I don't want to diminish or make fun of the importance of the issue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7414861" data-originallang="en">I think your instinct is correct. There's an anti-big tech sentiment increasingly over the past, let's say, five years and it makes big tech a convenient target. I think that is some of what is happening here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7414862" data-originallang="en">Big tech has a lot of money. I think it's perfectly reasonable to impose taxes upon big tech and, as I said, use that to fund journalism, but personally, I could live without the moral judgment because I don't think it's appropriate.</p>
