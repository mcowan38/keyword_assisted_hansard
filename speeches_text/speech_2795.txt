<p data-HoCid="7988386" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, I'll say thank you again to the witnesses for being here and sharing your expertise with us.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988387" data-originallang="en">I want to ask about the situation in the West Bank and in Jerusalem. We are seeing increased settler attacks on Palestinians and IDF killings of Palestinian civilians, including children. Settler attacks have unfortunately become a feature of the occupation, and Canada rarely if ever says anything about them. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7988388" data-originallang="en">Is the increase in settler attacks a factor in the slow pace of assisted departures for Canadians in the West Bank, and if not, could you explain to me the difference in the speed between assisted departures from Israel and from the West Bank?</p>
