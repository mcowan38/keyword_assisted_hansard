<p data-HoCid="8455476" data-originallang="en"> Thank you to the witnesses for attending this morning.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455477" data-originallang="en">This committee has heard disturbing evidence from Jewish Canadians from just about every generation going back to the post-Second World War period. Their testimony is clear and consistent: Jews are being targeted at every turn—students, professors, professionals, business owners, public servants, union members, faith leaders, families.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455478" data-originallang="en">Just last weekend there was the shooting at Bias Chaya Mushka, a Jewish day school for girls in North York, in my hometown of Toronto. That is another horrifying incident to add to the record levels of anti-Semitic violence against Jews as documented by B'nai Brith.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455479" data-originallang="en">Imagine having to send your daughter off to school this morning knowing there are people who want to attack her, and all you want to do is assure her she's going to be safe. How can Jews feel safe when laws aren't enforced? When encampments go on for weeks without consequence, or, as in the case of Adil Charkaoui in Montreal, who explicitly demonized Zionists and incited violence without facing charges, Jews can't feel safe. They don't feel safe, and the consequences are real. There are more unlawful protests, more violence, more Jew hatred. This study has to be a call to action for all Canadians to put on our gear, pick up a hose and extinguish the five-alarm fire that is anti-Semitism in this country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455480" data-originallang="en">This morning, I want to focus on a written submission from Canadian Women Against Antisemitism. This is a grassroots organization in Toronto. Their written submission explains in vivid detail the impacts of anti-Semitism on Jewish women. They make two key points: first, the word “Zionist” has been misappropriated and perverted as a racist trope against Jews; and second, sexual violence against women and girls is explicitly being coupled with Jewish hatred.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455481" data-originallang="en">We see this specifically at university encampments, where there are repeated denials of the rape and torture of women by Hamas, along with chants like, “Long live October 7,” glorifying terrorism, and, by extension, the violence done to women on that day. The submission even makes reference to a six-year-old girl who was told that she should be raped by Hitler and that all Jews should die.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455482" data-originallang="en">Mr. Sandler, you're an expert in criminal law, but you don't have to be an expert to conclude these are prima facie examples of hate speech. Am I correct about that?</p>
