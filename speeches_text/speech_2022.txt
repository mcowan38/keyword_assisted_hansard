<p data-HoCid="7512219" data-originallang="fr">Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I'm very pleased to see you take over the chairmanship.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7512220" data-originallang="fr">I know that Mr. Champoux's amendment is extremely important. Just before we adjourned the last meeting, I tabled a subamendment, and I hope it will have the support of the committee. It seeks to add the following paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7512221" data-originallang="fr"> (1.1) The code of ethics referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(iv) [this is the one proposed by Mr. Champoux] must include measures for ensuring that no news content that promotes hatred or misinformation against any identifiable group is produced or made available and that errors of fact are corrected promptly and in a transparent manner. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7512222" data-originallang="fr">This would, through the code of ethics in the excellent Bloc Québécois amendment, reduce the hatred and misinformation we see in society.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7512223" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Chair, as you know very well we have unfortunately been witnessing an increase in incitement to hate-based violence for several years. It's disturbing to see this across Canada. It is therefore important that the journalistic content that is supported by Bill C‑18 be subject to this code of ethics so that hate and misinformation are not part of it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7512224" data-originallang="en"> We've seen a disturbing rise in hate, a disturbing rise in racism and misogyny, a disturbing rise in anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, and a disturbing rise in homophobia and transphobia. This is something we have to take action on. Journalism plays a key role in that. We've already talked about Bill <a data-HoCid="11668222" href="/bills/44-1/C-18/" title="An Act respecting online communications platforms that make news content available to persons in Canada">C-18</a> playing a role in encouraging local journalism in a way that counters that hate and disinformation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7512225" data-originallang="en"> The reality is that what is foreseen in the Bloc Québécois amendment on a code of ethics is a code of ethics that must necessarily take into consideration hatred and misinformation against any identifiable group. This is something that I feel keenly is an important improvement to BQ-4, which is an excellent amendment that I'm prepared to support. This would ensure that the journalism supported by Bill <a data-HoCid="11668222" href="/bills/44-1/C-18/" title="An Act respecting online communications platforms that make news content available to persons in Canada">C-18</a> is subject to that code of ethics that counters hatred and disinformation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7512226" data-originallang="en">We have to take a stand. It's important. Bill <a data-HoCid="11668222" href="/bills/44-1/C-18/" title="An Act respecting online communications platforms that make news content available to persons in Canada">C-18</a> provides a lot more community support. The improvements that we've provided to Bill <a data-HoCid="11668222" href="/bills/44-1/C-18/" title="An Act respecting online communications platforms that make news content available to persons in Canada">C-18</a> provide for a lot more community journalism. It's important that this community journalism be subject to a code of ethics. It's important that this code of ethics includes measures that ensure that journalists at the community level and across the country are in no way promoting hatred or disinformation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7512227" data-originallang="en">On that note, I will move the subamendment.</p>
