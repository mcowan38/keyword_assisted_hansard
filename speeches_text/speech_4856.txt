<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8576287" data-originallang="en"> That this House do now adjourn. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8576288" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the incredible member for <a data-HoCid="278292" href="/politicians/lindsay-mathyssen/" title="Lindsay Mathyssen">Londonâ€”Fanshawe</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576289" data-originallang="en">Today, I rise with a heavy heart to amplify the voices of Edmonton Strathcona constituents, the Lebanese-Canadian community and Canadians from across the country who are devastated by the escalating violence in the Middle East. Canadians believe in justice and fairness in a world where innocent lives, all innocent lives, are protected. We have a history of being peacekeepers, of convening others and of making diplomatic efforts that not only kept peace, but also built peace. However, now, for months, people have been telling me that that is not what they are seeing from the government.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576290" data-originallang="en">A Canadian citizen of Lebanese heritage told me just this afternoon that she feels as though she does not belong, as though the government has turned its back on her and her human rights. Another individual told me that it is the double standard that is so horrifying to him. He asked me how the government can feel such empathy for Ukraine, and he was very clear that it should feel that empathy for Ukraine and for what is happening in Ukraine, but he questions why there is so little empathy for those who are from Palestine or Lebanon. This breaks my heart. The citizens of this country feel as though the government does not see their humanity, and this goes against everything we believe in as Canadians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576291" data-originallang="en">Tonight, we will speak to the crisis in Lebanon. We must. We must also speak to what happened today just hours ago. Iran launched missiles at Israel, further escalating this global crisis and threatening Israeli civilians. Every member of the House must unequivocally condemn this horrific escalation by Iran. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8576292" data-originallang="en">I want to be crystal clear: Civilians in Israel, in Gaza, in Lebanon and in the wider region are paying the price for the failures of world leaders. The world is on the brink of further violence because we have not been holding political leaders to the standards of international law, we have collectively tolerated the erosion of rules-based international order, we have not done enough to de-escalate and we have not countered the warmongering and the hate that is too prevalent among the powerful.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576293" data-originallang="en">There is no military solution to this crisis. War crimes must not beget war crimes. If we continue down this path, there is nothing but death. For one year, we have witnessed the horrifying violence of Netanyahu's genocide in Gaza, which followed the terrible Hamas terrorist attack on Israel on October 7. For one year, our party has appealed to the Canadian government to do the hard work to secure a ceasefire, to implement a real arms embargo, to get Palestinians to safety, to return the hostages, to de-escalate and to save the lives of so many, including children and vulnerable people, especially Palestinians in Gaza, who are bearing the cost of political inaction and the betrayal of international law.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576294" data-originallang="en">We are now here to discuss a new escalation of violence, the violence and aggression that may cost even more lives, including the lives of Canadians. All of us in the House have constituents who have loved ones in the Middle East. The Lebanese community in Canada includes hundreds of thousands of people. Around 45,000 Canadians currently live in Lebanon, and we already know that two have lost their lives. While Canada has offered limited consular services in the form of seats on commercial flights, we know that many people cannot reach the airports due to air strikes. There is no power. There is no Internet. There is chaos, and Lebanese Canadians have told me that they do not know where to turn.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576295" data-originallang="en">Over the past several days, a thousand people have been killed in Lebanon, 6,000 have been wounded and one million people have been displaced from their homes as a result of Israeli air strikes. Israeli is bombing densely populated cities, and Hezbollah, a listed terrorist organization under Canadian law, is launching more rockets toward Israel. Tonight, Iran launched ballistic missiles at Israel, another frightening development that threatens Israeli civilians, who, like everyone else, deserve peace and to live in security. We know this could lead to a wider war.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576296" data-originallang="en">There is retaliation after retaliation, and the escalation is terrifying. We are on the brink, and it is our duty, as parliamentarians and as Canadians, to not just call for a ceasefire, but to use every tool possible to bring about peace.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576297" data-originallang="en">I want to be clear. Hezbollah is a listed terrorist organization under Canada law that has committed very serious crimes over the decades. Hezbollah and its leaders should be brought to justice, just as the Iranian regime, a sponsor of Hezbollah and Hamas, should be brought to justice. New Democrats have worked hard to ensure that Canada listed the IRGC as a terrorist organization. We worked hard to bring a motion to the House calling for the Toomaj sanctions against Iranian leaders. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8576298" data-originallang="en">However, the Iranian people are not the Iranian regime. The people of Lebanon are not Hezbollah. The people of Palestine are not Hamas. The people of Israel are not Netanyahu.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576299" data-originallang="en">International law clearly states that civilians are never a target, not in Palestine, not in Lebanon, not in Israel and not in Iran. International law states, clearly, that wars have limits. The fundamental rule of international humanitarian law in conflict is that all parties must distinguish at all times between combatants and civilians. What we have seen over the past year with Israel's genocide in Gaza is that the Netanyahu government is ignoring its obligations under international law. There is no consideration for civilians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576300" data-originallang="en">Giving people a 30-minute warning that their homes are going to be bombed when they have nowhere to go does not absolve it of its responsibilities. That is not how international law works. Civilian protection is absolute. To suggest that these civilians do not matter or that they are collateral damage, whether they are Palestinian or Lebanese, is racism. It is deplorable. It is dehumanization, and it is intolerable. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8576301" data-originallang="en">The people of Lebanon are terrified that Lebanon will become the next Gaza. The people of Lebanon are still dealing with the worst economic crisis they have ever seen. They have not recovered from the explosion in the Port of Beirut. Their hospitals are short of medicine. The people of Lebanon do not want war. Children will bear the brunt of this war just as children in Gaza have borne the brunt of the genocide.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576302" data-originallang="en">Just yesterday, Oxfam reported that more women and children were killed in Gaza by the Israeli military than in any other recent conflict in a single year. Thousands have fled for safety. Children are traumatized, and homes have been destroyed. I am grateful to the many humanitarians, medics and helpers who are doing everything they can to save lives and help the one million who have been displaced, but this is a political problem, and it will require a political solution.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576303" data-originallang="en"> Tonight, as we stand here in relative safety in Canada, afraid for what comes next and thinking of the traumatized children in Israel hiding in bomb shelters tonight, knowing that the displaced children in Lebanon and Gaza do not have bomb shelters and are equally traumatized, we have a duty to act. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8576304" data-originallang="en">The UN has called on Israel to end the ground incursion, which is a violation of UN resolutions and a violation of Lebanon's sovereignty. Israel has ignored an international request for a 21-day ceasefire, which Canada and many other states have asked for. Earlier today, the United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon stated: </p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8576305" data-originallang="en"> What we feared has materialized. With strikes throughout Lebanon, including in the heart of Beirut, and incursions across the Blue Line, violence is spiralling to dangerous heights. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8576306" data-originallang="en"> Every rocket and missile fired, every bomb dropped and every ground raid conducted pull the parties further from the vision set out in Security Council resolution 1701 (2006).... </p>
<p data-HoCid="8576307" data-originallang="en"> This cycle of violence will not end well - for anyone. A sliver of opportunity remains for diplomacy to succeed. The question now is whether it will be seized or squandered. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8576308" data-originallang="en">Canada needs to act now. Canada needs to call on Israel to stop. There must be an arms embargo, including closing the loopholes that allow weapons to go through the U.S. We must put sanctions on Netanyahu's extremist government. It is clear that over the past year, none of the actions have made Israelis safer. We have spoken to many Israelis who are marching in the streets, opposing the government's violence, calling for a hostage deal and a ceasefire. Arab leaders, such as the Jordanian foreign minister, have stated clearly that Netanyahu is not a partner for peace. There are partners for peace in Israel, people who reject the dehumanization of others, people who yearn for peace and justice for all, but Netanyahu is not one of them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576309" data-originallang="en">New Democrats stand in solidarity with the innocent people of Lebanon, Palestine and Israel. Canada must do better.</p>
