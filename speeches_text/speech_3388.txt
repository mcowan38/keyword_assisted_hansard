<p data-HoCid="8173091" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair, and again, I really do appreciate the work of my colleague Ms. Gazan, who has brought this amendment forward. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8173092" data-originallang="en">This is an important issue. It's an important issue that we absolutely take to heart. I can tell you that every one of my colleagues at this table takes this amendment and this issue very seriously.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8173093" data-originallang="en">But simply put, we want to study it further. We want to understand it better so we can act on it. We need to understand it. First and foremost, I do believe that the principle of “nothing without us” is absolutely paramount. We want to hear from first nations, Inuit and Métis here around this committee table and on Parliament Hill on this very issue, and I think it is an important issue. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8173094" data-originallang="en">It's important for those watching at home to understand that our government is bringing forward a bill that will introduce 15 weeks of EI for adoptive and intended parents. That bill is already in front of the House of Commons in the form of Bill <a data-HoCid="12739107" href="/bills/44-1/C-59/" title="An Act to implement certain provisions of the fall economic statement tabled in Parliament on November 21, 2023 and certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on March 28, 2023">C-59</a>. That bill will introduce 15 weeks of EI for adoptive parents. It builds upon the works of this committee. There will be an opportunity with the government bill that's moving forward, and hopefully, with the support of our opposition members, Bill C-59 will pass in the House quickly. Right now it's facing some headwinds from our opposition colleagues, but we hope to see it pass quickly so that we can get those benefits into the hands of adoptive parents as quickly as possible. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8173095" data-originallang="en">That bill will have an opportunity to come before committee, and there will be opportunities for first nations, Métis and Inuit members to come to Parliament Hill to talk about kinship and customary care relationships to provide members of Parliament with information and with deeper understanding of what that means and of how it fits into this EI policy framework. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8173096" data-originallang="en">It is an important issue, and we feel that it is so important that we want to hear from indigenous partners and communities. There will be an opportunity as this bill is debated at committee, as Bill <a data-HoCid="12739107" href="/bills/44-1/C-59/" title="An Act to implement certain provisions of the fall economic statement tabled in Parliament on November 21, 2023 and certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on March 28, 2023">C-59</a>, which contains the EI provisions for adoptive parents, is debated in committee. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8173097" data-originallang="en">The principle of “nothing without us” is absolutely paramount, and on an issue as important as this one, we believe that it is absolutely imperative that we hear from indigenous partners, indigenous communities. There will be an opportunity to do that as Bill <a data-HoCid="12739107" href="/bills/44-1/C-59/" title="An Act to implement certain provisions of the fall economic statement tabled in Parliament on November 21, 2023 and certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on March 28, 2023">C-59</a>, our government bill that will introduce 15 weeks of EI for adoptive parents, is brought before committee very shortly. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8173098" data-originallang="en">With the help and support of our opposition partners, it will come before committee very quickly. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8173099" data-originallang="en">Thank you. </p>
