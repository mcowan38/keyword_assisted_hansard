<p data-HoCid="8435142" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435143" data-originallang="en">Thanks to all of you for your excellent contributions today, and apologies for the climate in which you have to appear before this committee. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8435144" data-originallang="en">Dr. Diamond, perhaps I could start briefly with you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435145" data-originallang="en"> I only have six minutes, so I'm looking for a quick response. You set the table about the evolution of anti-Semitism over the ages, and it strikes me that you have concluded, sir, that anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism today. Just to be precise, would you agree with that?</p>
