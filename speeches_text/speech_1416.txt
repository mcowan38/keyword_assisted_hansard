<p data-HoCid="7002333" data-originallang="fr">Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002334" data-originallang="fr">Actually, in seven minutes, it will be difficult to ask questions about the human rights situation around the world. It's a big job, you might say.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002335" data-originallang="fr">I will start with Amnesty International's very interesting report on the human rights situation in Palestine. It's not the first report of its kind. Human Rights Watch has done similar work before.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002336" data-originallang="fr">In 2018, I had the opportunity to be part of the Canadian parliamentary delegation that visited the occupied territories on the West Bank. We had a lot of meetings with people from civil society and with those representing various organizations. We were able to see first-hand the military occupation, the checkpoints, the wall, and the daily humiliations that the Palestine people are subject to. That does not get into the headlines. There may not be explosions, war, or shelling, but people are subject to frustration, humiliation and contempt. There are all kinds of examples: the need to completely surround a city, the terrible situations in Hebron, the destruction of houses and farms to make way for illegal settlements.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002337" data-originallang="fr">Ms. Nivyabandi and Ms. Langlois, I would like your comments on what you have observed for four years. You used the word “apartheid” to describe what Palestinians are going through.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002338" data-originallang="fr">Can you give us some concrete examples of what you observed?</p>
