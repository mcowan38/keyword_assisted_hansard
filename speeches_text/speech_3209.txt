<p data-HoCid="8124784" data-originallang="en">Of course, it is our job as officials to try to prepare for the future. We know right now that there is a phenomenal trust deficit between Palestinians and Israelis, between those warring factions. To conceive of a peace plan is almost unthinkable for the parties on the ground. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8124785" data-originallang="en">However, it is our job to think about it. It is our job to start talking to the middle-ground individuals who can foresee a day on which a path or political process brings parties closer, to give security guarantees to both sides—both feel extremely insecure right now—and to find other partners in the region. The solution is eventually going to have to be one that is regional, with support from international players. Canada very much counts on being, and believes it can be, one of those international players.</p>
