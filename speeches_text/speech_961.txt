<p data-HoCid="6700174" data-originallang="en"> I have a couple of quick things to say.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6700175" data-originallang="en">The first is that, yes, the international experience is extremely important and in part because the U.K. and Israel, as you mentioned, were well ahead of Canada in the rollout of their vaccines. They have a time advantage on us. In addition—and I'd like to mention this very clearly—there are much more unified data systems across their countries. This is a barrier in Canada that we need to address. The fact that they have this data now, with vaccine coverage rates that are over 50%, is very helpful in understanding and informing our models related to herd immunity.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6700176" data-originallang="en">The U.K. is particularly relevant because they have adopted this “first dose fast” strategy. What we can see from the data at the moment is that this strategy has been very successful in curbing the third wave. That, to me, suggests that the approach Canada has adopted, similar to the U.K.'s, holds promise for getting us through this third wave and stresses the importance of accelerating the vaccine rollout as fast as possible.</p>
