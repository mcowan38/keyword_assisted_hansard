<p data-HoCid="6649790" data-originallang="en">I appreciate the position of the clerk, but to clarify, this addition clarifies the preamble. It gives better direction in the preamble, and based on chapter 16, it is permissible under the rules of the House. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6649791" data-originallang="en">Therefore, I'm going to submit that it is appropriate to move forward with this amendment. Ms. Gazan's amendment was on a different part of the bill, and we appreciate the work that she has put in. We thank her for that, but the clarity that was sought in the preamble is being provided here.</p>
