<p data-HoCid="6488628" data-originallang="en">First of all, I think what we're dealing with is a lack of domestic capacity to produce vaccine, which leaves us vulnerable to what's going on in other countries.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6488629" data-originallang="en">We're seeing now threats, or moves, by the European Union to possibly restrict the export of vaccines from those countries.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6488630" data-originallang="en">Those are issues that we don't have any control over, nor do we really have the information to know what's going to be happening with delivery because we don't know anything about prices. Based on leaks from other countries, we know that there are differences in prices that have been negotiated.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6488631" data-originallang="en">For instance, the U.K. and Israel seem to have negotiated higher prices than the European Union, which may be affecting how quickly companies deliver to the European Union. We don't know the prices that Canada has paid.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6488632" data-originallang="en">This lack of information is a significant deterrent to being able to understand what our capacity is going to be to be able to vaccinate people over the coming months.</p>
