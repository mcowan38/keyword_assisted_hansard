<p data-HoCid="6382791" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6382792" data-originallang="fr">Thank you to the witnesses, the Honourable Bob Rae, Mr. Beasley and Mr. Lowcock, for being with us today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6382793" data-originallang="fr">It is safe to say you are a very prestigious panel. We maybe should have given ourselves more time with you so we could take a deeper dive into certain issues.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6382794" data-originallang="fr">First, I would like to take this opportunity to challenge a statement the Conservative members made ad nauseam today in the House of Commonsâ€”that Canada's vote in favour of the self-determination of the Palestinian people is a vote against Israel. I profoundly disagree with that statement. On the contrary, I think peace for both Israel and Palestine depends on the recognition of a Palestinian state living in peace alongside Israel. I do not believe Canada's vote is a vote against Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6382795" data-originallang="fr">Speaking of Palestine, I would like to ask the witnesses, beginning with Mr. Rae, about the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. The agency fears that it will not be able to afford to keep essential services going as the health crisis worsens. Its commissioner-general announced that he had informed all 28,000 staff members that the agency did not have the funds to pay their salaries for the month, jeopardizing the services it provides.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6382796" data-originallang="fr">Does Canada plan to increase its contribution to the agency? What can be done to avert a humanitarian disaster among Palestinian refugees, who have faced significant hardship for years?</p>
