<p data-HoCid="8065334" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that a modern Parliament worthy of its name needs to address certain things that we are long overdue in addressing, things that perhaps never should have happened in the first place.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8065335" data-originallang="fr">There is a cost to living together and to living in harmony in society. That cost may simply be to refrain from giving inappropriate and undue privileges to people within a society who use them to disturb the peace and harmony, especially if those privileges enable people to sow hatred or wish death upon others based on a belief in some divine power.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8065336" data-originallang="fr">That is even more true in a country that claims to be secular or that claims that there is a separation between church and state. That is why it is high time that someone took action.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8065337" data-originallang="fr">I would ask the House to quickly support the act to amend the Criminal Code throughout the process in order to prevent the promotion of hatred and antisemitism.</p>
<p class="procedural" data-HoCid="2"> (Motions deemed adopted, bill read the first time and printed)</p>
