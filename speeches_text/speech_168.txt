<p data-HoCid="6169346" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his speech, which I found very interesting.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6169347" data-originallang="fr">Obviously, every democracy embraces the concept of liberty and its value. I was pleased to hear him talk about not only the protests in Hong Kong, but also the plight of Tibetans and Uighurs, who are being oppressed by the government in Beijing. However, given how we embrace the idea of liberty and human rights, I would like to hear his thoughts on the rights of the Palestinian people, who have been under military occupation for decades now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6169348" data-originallang="fr">What does he think of the Palestinian people's right to dignity and liberty?</p>
