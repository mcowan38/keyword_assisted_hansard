<p data-HoCid="8340308" data-originallang="en">Absolutely, I would. I think it's a great idea, and I'd love to work with parliamentarians on this on behalf of the Canadian Polish Congress as vice-president for Canadian affairs. I'm certainly open to working with other organizations like the UCC, CIJA, B'nai Brith and others to foster that reconciliation and understanding. I was born in Canada. I grew up here, and I value the relationships I have with members of the Jewish and Ukrainian communities, and I think there's definitely more we can do. If there's leadership from parliamentarians and a willingness to organize an initiative like this, we'd be happy to participate.</p>
