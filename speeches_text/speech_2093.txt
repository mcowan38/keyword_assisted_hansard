<p data-HoCid="7516623" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, this Sunday will mark the first night of Hanukkah. In my riding of York Centre and in homes across Canada and around the world, millions of Jewish families will light the hanukkiah and celebrate the festival of lights. The light of the hanukkiah is a symbol of peace and life. As we add candles each night, peace and hope grow stronger and brighter. It is always light that triumphs over darkness.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7516624" data-originallang="en">This year, we have lost one of those lights as we mourn the loss of our friend and colleague Jim Carr. He was a model of kindness, compassion and selflessness in this House and for all Canadians. Jim's advice was always given with the love of life and country, a twinkle in his eye, a laugh and a smile. He was the eldest and wisest member of our Jewish and Jewish-Muslim caucuses. I can only hope that, in the time we were privileged to share with him, a bit of that wisdom has passed on to us. His love and pride of his heritage, the Prairies and the communities he was a part of were a source of strength for so many.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7516625" data-originallang="en">As we prepare to celebrate Hanukkah, may Jim's family find strength and comfort from his light and the legacy he held in the House, in Winnipeg South Centre and across Canada. <em>Yehi zichro baruch</em>. May his memory be a blessing. </p>
