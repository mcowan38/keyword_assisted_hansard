<p data-HoCid="7661465" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Ms. Gazan.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7661466" data-originallang="en">Thank you to the witnesses for your presentations before committee today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7661467" data-originallang="en"> We're still in public, so I'm going to use a few minutes to ask the clerk to give an overview.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7661468" data-originallang="en"> The witnesses can excuse themselves from the meeting and virtually.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7661469" data-originallang="en">Again, thank you for your time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7661470" data-originallang="en">We have a few minutes. As you know, committee members, we had two meetings displaced. House operations gave us three options. We said yes to all three. Then they came back and said, “no”, “no” and “yes”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7661471" data-originallang="en">The one option we have currently is for next Thursday evening from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. As chair, I have scheduled a meeting for next Thursday from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. to continue with the committee, with witnesses that will be scheduled then.</p>
