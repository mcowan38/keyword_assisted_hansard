<p data-HoCid="8332880" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I have another petition that I would like to present in the House at this time. It is the ninth largest e-petition in Canadian history. It is e-4745, with 82,248 signatures. This petition was initiated by Canadians for justice and peace in the Middle East.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8332881" data-originallang="en">These Canadians are asking the government to, first of all, impose a two-way embargo on arms between Canada and Israel; investigate whether Canadian weapons or weapon components have been used against Palestinian civilians in the occupied Palestinian territories, including during the current war in Gaza; review all military and security co-operation between Canada and Israel; and close loopholes that allow for the unregulated and unreported transfer of military goods to Israel through the United States.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8332882" data-originallang="en">It has been six months since this conflict began. More than 30,000 people have lost their lives, including over 13,000 children. Canada has an obligation under the Arms Trade Treaty to ensure that we are not fuelling this conflict.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8332883" data-originallang="en">I ask the Government of Canada to consider this petition; the New Democratic Party of Canada stands very staunchly with the 82,000â€”</p>
