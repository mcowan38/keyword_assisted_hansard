<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">It was touched upon earlier, but of course this week Conservative leader <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">Poilievre</a> made a truly appalling statement: that Israel could strike Iranian nuclear facilities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">We know how disastrous that could be. The international community has fought very hard to protect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from Putin's bombings. Your government called that reckless statement out. We certainly did, and now Iran has been threatening to proactively attack those nuclear facilities and escalate the conflict even further.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Minister, is the threat of an attack by Israel on nuclear facilities a red line for your government and will Canada finally commit to imposing sanctions on Netanyahu's dangerous government?</p>
