<p data-HoCid="8300403" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Deputy Minister, for being here and answering our questions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300404" data-originallang="en">I just want to ask some general questions about how Canada deals with people who have passports from entities that may not be recognized as countries. For instance, the Liberal government currently recognizes Israel as a state, but not Palestine; however, they do recognize that the Palestinian Authority can and does issue passports for people in those territories.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300405" data-originallang="en">That said, before I get into the issue specifically, I just want to know more generally about the process. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8300406" data-originallang="en">What is the IRCC's estimate of the percentage of people who arrive at our border who may have passports but are not from countries that are recognized by Canada?</p>
