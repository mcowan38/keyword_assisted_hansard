<p data-HoCid="8693754" data-originallang="fr">I welcome all the witnesses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693755" data-originallang="fr">I'll go to you, Ms. Musu, if I may.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693756" data-originallang="fr">Your research has really explored Canada's relations with the United States, as well as with its European allies, concerning this conflict.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693757" data-originallang="fr">How do you think Canada could leverage its partnerships with the United States and Europe, with which it maintains close relations, to try to support significant progress towards a two-state solution? How can Canada specifically leverage its alliances with the United States and with European countries to achieve this?</p>
