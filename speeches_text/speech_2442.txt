<p data-HoCid="7820642" data-originallang="en">Minister, I wanted to probe a little further on MP Gazan's question, because she's asked it a few times in the House and I feel like we never have enough time to answer it. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7820643" data-originallang="en">You mentioned around $150 million for funding for women's shelters. I don't want to put words in anyone's mouth, but as you've acknowledged the national action plan, the timing of that is coinciding with the expiration of that funding. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7820644" data-originallang="en">I want to give you the floor to give you a bit more time for that answer.</p>
