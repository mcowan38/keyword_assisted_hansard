<p data-HoCid="7406971" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7406972" data-originallang="en">First, I wish to extend my gratitude to the chairs and the joint committee for the honour of being invited here today to discuss the extremely important topic of the use of advance directives pertaining to MAID.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7406973" data-originallang="en">By way of introduction, I'm the senior ethicist at Baycrest Health Sciences. I have a status-only position as assistant professor in the department of medicine at the University of Toronto, and I'm a fellow of Ben-Gurion University in Israel. As well, I'm a member of the MAiDHouse advisory council. However, my comments are mine alone, and I am not representing any of these organizations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7406974" data-originallang="en">My comments are also informed by many years of being a clinical psychologist, philosopher and ethicist within health care organizations with much experience in the use of advance directives with the Alzheimer's/dementia population.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7406975" data-originallang="en">I have chaired many MAID committees and provided ethics oversight to ongoing cases. My publications include my doctoral thesis in philosophy on this topic, and a book published by Springer International in 2018 on the topic of dementia and the use of advance directives.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7406976" data-originallang="en">My academic and clinical experience portrays a range of significant concerns that arise out of the use of advance directives—and I want to say this point with distinction here—at least in the terms of how they are currently being used with the Alzheimer's/dementia population. The main question I pose is whether legalizing advance requests for MAID for those who face dementia is morally justifiable.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7406977" data-originallang="en">However, this doesn't just apply to situations where MAID is concerned, but applies equally to situations where treatments are withdrawn. Later, I will discuss suggestions to alter the conceptualization and use of advance directives in order to enhance the level and moral justification of their use.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7406978" data-originallang="en">As a number of panellists have already discussed, the dominant conception about Alzheimer's is that it's a disease of horrific tragedy and necessarily leads to loss of personhood. At least in North America, this is a very prominent conceptualization. The negative stereotype of Alzheimer's is often at the root of why people write directives in the first place, which state their desires to forgo treatment if and when dementia does strike. These directives can be especially problematic if the person with dementia is generally happy. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7406979" data-originallang="en">We also may not possess the requisite imagination or learned experience necessary to be good predictors of what we may or may not want in future situations when we offer our advance directive. Our values and our beliefs may radically change over time, and our frames of reference may alter.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7406980" data-originallang="en">Substitute decision-makers, SDMs, might also be privileging particular kinds of interest over others, not necessarily the patient's interests. SDMs do not always follow even relatively clearly expressed treatment wishes, for a variety of reasons, as my research has shown. It's problematic, therefore, to assume that having a substitute decision-maker to interpret the directive and provide the requisite informed consent generally adds any merit at all.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7406981" data-originallang="en">There is potentially tremendous subjectivity, variation and inconsistency occurring with regard to conceptualization of the advance directive in the first place, how its contents get interpreted, its intended and actual use, and how and whether it gets applied.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7406982" data-originallang="en">I also learned in my work that it would be a mistake to assume that the author of the directive behaves in a more predictable fashion. It would not be exceptional for him or her to neither expect nor even want the directive to be perceived as definitive. Rarely, however, are these expectations or wishes known to the substitute decision-maker, and even if they were, they would not necessarily prove to be the current expectations or wishes of the person with dementia.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7406983" data-originallang="en">To increase the moral nature of advance directives, not only should these concerns be rectified to the point possible, but authors of advance directives ought to be educated about the downfalls as well as the strengths of having an advance directive in order to be better informed when making a decision about whether or not an advance directive is in their best clinical interest in the long run. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7406984" data-originallang="en">I have some clinical and policy recommendations. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7406985" data-originallang="en">One, an advance directive ought to be explicitly considered as only one piece of information among many about a person's intentions and/or preferences. It is not the sole determinant of settling any medical treatment decisions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7406986" data-originallang="en"> Two, because an advance directive document is, at best, a weak example of the principle of autonomy, treatment wishes in any advance directive should not be construed as equivalent to or having the same self-determination status as treatment wishes made in real time by the patients.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7406987" data-originallang="en"> Three, many people with dementia will still be capable of holding values, wishes and interests that matter to them. In this view, they ought to be considered to be at least borderline or partially autonomous, and medical treatment decisions should be made that cohere with them whenever possible.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7406988" data-originallang="en">Four, a directive that's very recent and doesn't seem to have been made obsolete by changes in the patient's statements, attitudes or responses to treatment can be treated simply as a current expression of their wishes. Then, in some imprecise but significant way, its status as a current expression—hence to be taken as an exercise of autonomy currently—degrades quickly with the passage of time or the onset of attitudes or behaviour—i.e., general happiness—in tension with the content or presuppositions of the advance directive.</p>
