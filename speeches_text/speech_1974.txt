<p data-HoCid="7430856" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7430857" data-originallang="en">I have two questions for Dr. Dhara.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7430858" data-originallang="en">You reminded us of what in bioethics is known as the “yuck factor”. As a reminder, it's an intuitive emotional response to something that should be interpreted as evidence for the intrinsically harmful or evil characteristic of that thing. It's the idea that repugnance equals wisdom, or repugnance equals a moral judgment.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7430859" data-originallang="en">That's been used throughout history to justify anti-Semitism, racism, homophobia, alternative sexualities, same-sex marriage, etc. Mr. Trump glorified it with his decision-making motto of “this is my gut feeling and therefore it's right”. You warned us against making this mistake in our thinking.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7430860" data-originallang="en">Do you think this yuck factor and its counterpart of moral panic may characterize some of the highly emotional discussions that occur around MAID?</p>
