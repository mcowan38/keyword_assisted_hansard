<p data-HoCid="7835840" data-originallang="en"> Okay. I'll come back to this question, because I also note in the estimates a decrease of nearly $12 million for the community support, multiculturalism and anti-racism initiatives in your department. I mentioned earlier the increases in hate crimes provoked by the extreme right. In anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, there's a 67% increase; in crimes related to sexual orientation, there's a 64% increase; in race and ethnicity, there's a 6% increase. This is over the course of the last couple of years. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7835841" data-originallang="en">We see a decrease in funding at the same time that we see a marked increase in police-reported hate crime. I want to know how the government manages that contradiction in decreasing funding at a time when anti-racism initiatives are needed more than ever. </p>
