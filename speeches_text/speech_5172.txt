<p data-HoCid="8679468" data-originallang="en"> There have been, in the last year, over 42,000 people killed, about 80% of whom are civilians and 60% of whom are women and children. I'm not sure how you would qualify the political force that does that as a liberal democracy. It's a liberal democracy within its own borders. It's not a liberal democracy in the territories it occupies. By siding with those who committed these massacres, we are not standing for liberal democracies.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679469" data-originallang="en">I would like to quote Omer Bartov, a Jewish Israeli citizen who served in the Israeli army and is a professor of history specializing in genocides. He wrote a column in The Guardian, on August 13, where he says that he now believes that what is going on is genocide. This is an Israeli Jewish citizen who served in the Israeli army. We have to take that into account when taking a stand on this issue. </p>
