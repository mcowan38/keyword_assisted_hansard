<p data-HoCid="8281123" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, these beautiful Palestinian children and babies who have been murdered in these last months deserve better than to be a political project for domestic pandering by the hon. member. Those children are being offered up by Hamas as human shields rather than being sheltered in the tunnel networks that Hamas has built to support its terrorism, which are multiple times the size of the New York subway or the London underground.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8281124" data-originallang="en">The hon. member's focus is an obsession with the democratic State of Israel, which is trying to liberate not just the babies and hostages held by Hamas today in Israel but also Palestinians from the yoke of tyranny that Hamas and its Iranian sponsors have been putting Palestinians through. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8281125" data-originallang="en">Rest assured that our commitment to every child everywhere in this world is steadfast and strong today.</p>
