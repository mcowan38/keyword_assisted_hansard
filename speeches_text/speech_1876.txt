<p data-HoCid="7345647" data-originallang="fr">The anti-Semitism and attacks on French speakers that have taken place have gone unanswered. I have two questions about this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345648" data-originallang="fr">Firstly, has there ever been a requirement for organizations to attest that no hate speech is made within them?</p>
