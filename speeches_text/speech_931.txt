<p data-HoCid="6664101" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, our government takes anti-Semitism very seriously, and we have always stood up against it. We have put in place an anti-racism action plan that specifically outlines a definition that is internationally accepted with respect anti-Semitism.
