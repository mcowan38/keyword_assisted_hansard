<p data-HoCid="7439726" data-originallang="en"> Jenna, thank you so much for the question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7439727" data-originallang="en">It is not a small thing to have all of the provinces and territories sign on to something like this. It's not a small thing; it's a monumental thing, as you point out. The impact is huge—and it will be huge. We have seen, through this pandemic, who was disproportionately impacted. Women and girls—and then you put an intersectional lens on that—were at the head of the pack, which is why our government responded the way it did, with half a billion dollars towards ending gender-based violence.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7439728" data-originallang="en">I have to reiterate that this was born and we would not be at this point.... It was the community that came together and told us, grassroots organizations and survivors who said, “This is my story. How can we do better?” Provinces said that they really appreciated the way these discussions were going, but they needed to go back to their indigenous leaders in their various provinces and territories and talk to them, because this is about inclusivity. It's about getting it right. It's about doing it right and it's about saving lives. I cannot underscore enough how this is going to impact women, girls, men and boys across this country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7439729" data-originallang="en">One example, if I might, is Velma's House in Winnipeg Centre, <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Leah Gazan</a>'s riding. When I visited last summer, there were women under the porch, on the porch, and it was at capacity inside. It is a low-barrier house that accepts anybody. Whether they have addictions, mental health issues, whatever, they're accepted—except they were full.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7439730" data-originallang="en">Weeks ago, Leah was so instrumental, and others as well. We were able to provide $1 million from our ministry to keep the doors open for the time being, and then <a data-HoCid="278911" href="/politicians/patty-hajdu/" title="Patty Hajdu">Minister Hajdu</a>, with $2 million dollars for Velma's House to buy a Ronald McDonald House that was bigger, which would give them the opportunity to help more women and have trauma-informed support and counsellors.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7439731" data-originallang="en">They are moving shortly. We made the announcement in the new Ronald McDonald House, the centre where they will be. Lives will be saved. That day, survivors spoke—survivors who are on the streets, who found Velma's, and who are now counsellors themselves.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7439732" data-originallang="en">That is one of many places that will be served by this action plan. There are so many others, but I'm happy to speak to that.</p>
