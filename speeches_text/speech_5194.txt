<p data-HoCid="8683569" data-originallang="en">There was the Conservative private member's bill that I mentioned earlier. Also, I think there's a role for policy-makers and parliamentarians here to defend the right to free speech, so that we don't fully descend into a fascist government, like what we're seeing in Israel. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8683570" data-originallang="en">To be able to protect our free speech and to be able to criticize and find constructive ways forward, so we recentre human rights, people and care and dignity, are the utmost things we can do. </p>
