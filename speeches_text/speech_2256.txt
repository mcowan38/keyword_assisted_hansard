<p data-HoCid="7702214" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to thank everyone who has supported Bill <a data-HoCid="11876139" href="/bills/44-1/C-288/" title="An Act to amend the Telecommunications Act (transparent and accurate broadband services information)">C-288</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7702215" data-originallang="en">I want to thank Canadians who demanded this bill, particularly the rural Canadians, who understand the frustration of paying for Internet that fails to live up to advertised speeds, but Bill <a data-HoCid="11876139" href="/bills/44-1/C-288/" title="An Act to amend the Telecommunications Act (transparent and accurate broadband services information)">C-288</a> would not only impact rural Canadians; it would impact all Canadians who buy Internet service.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7702216" data-originallang="en">I thank my Conservative colleagues, who continue to fight for more competition and lower prices in the telecom industry. I thank the experts, including those from OpenMedia, Dr. Reza Rajabiun, those from the Canadian Internet Registration Authority and Tamir Israel, who generously provided advice and feedback on this bill.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7702217" data-originallang="en">I thank the member for <a data-HoCid="278407" href="/politicians/sebastien-lemire/" title="Sébastien Lemire">Abitibi—Témiscamingue</a> and the member for <a data-HoCid="278412" href="/politicians/brian-masse/" title="Brian Masse">Windsor West</a> for their continued support on this pro-consumer legislation. I thank the Standing Committee on Industry and Technology for studying this legislation quickly and effectively. I thank all the members of this House who have supported Bill <a data-HoCid="11876139" href="/bills/44-1/C-288/" title="An Act to amend the Telecommunications Act (transparent and accurate broadband services information)">C-288</a> and who will hopefully continue to do so.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7702218" data-originallang="en"> As a wise man once famously said, “Only when the tide goes out do you learn who has been swimming naked.” I will tell members, when the tide goes out on the Internet companies that have been selling Canadians misleading speeds, we will see. For years, the government has allowed Internet companies to legally sell Internet speeds that simply do not exist. While countries around the world have implemented laws to protect their consumers, the Canadian government has sat idly by. Canadians deserve to know what Internet speeds they are paying for, and Canadians should accept nothing less.</p>
