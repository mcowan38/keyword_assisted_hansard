<p data-HoCid="8277225" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, first and foremost, I think it is important that we recognize that it was on March 1 that the House made an order indicating that we would be having the vote today at 7:15 p.m., an hour ago. Every member understood before the recess that the vote would be taking place this evening.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8277226" data-originallang="en">The other issue I have is this: Take a look at the purpose of opposition days and at the process we have witnessed today. There is no new element being introduced to the motion, and I will expand on that right away. What is important is to recognize the process that has gotten us to this point.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8277227" data-originallang="en">The NDP introduced a motion. There was a great deal of debate on it. There were all sorts of crossover discussions taking place, and at the end of the day, the <a data-HoCid="303111" href="/politicians/steven-mackinnon/" title="Steven MacKinnon">government House leader</a> moved an amendment. That amendment, which is completely within scope, was accepted by the member for <a data-HoCid="278368" href="/politicians/heather-mcpherson/" title="Heather McPherson">Edmonton Strathcona</a>. The Speaker reread the amendment and then ruled that it was, in fact, in order, as has been done previously on many different opposition days.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8277228" data-originallang="en">I take exception when members opposite try to give the false impression that it is out of scope. Let me give a very specific example. When they stood on the point of order to try to filibuster a vote, they made reference to the fact that the Gaza issue is a very important aspect of the amendment. Let us go to what the motion actually says about Gaza and ask how they could imply that the amendment would in any way be out of scope.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8277229" data-originallang="en">I would refer people to part (viii): “the forcible transfer and violent attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank have significantly increased in recent months”. How could they say that an amendment dealing with the West Bank is, in fact, out of scope, when it is actually in the motion that has been presented?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8277230" data-originallang="en">We can go further, to part (g): “ban extremist settlers”. Again, how could we not identify that this is also a part of Gaza?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8277231" data-originallang="en">I go to part (h): “advocate for an end to the decades-long occupation of Palestinian territories and work toward a two-state solution”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8277232" data-originallang="en">I would argue against the very premise. After the Speaker agreed everything was in order, and the vote was just about to occur, a member stood up and brought up an issue, saying that the amendment is not within scope. In fact it is, and Gaza is actually mentioned, if members had listened to the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> when she made her presentation to the House, and to where other members even make reference to both Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8277233" data-originallang="en"> I would suggest not only that it is within the scope but also that we have an order from March 1 saying that the vote should occur today at 7:15 p.m. I would suggest that we get on with it and vote.</p>
