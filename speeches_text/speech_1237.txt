<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, my thanks are to Nick Milanovic, Isabelle D’Souza and Mark Rowlinson for their expert help on this bill. My thoughts today are with the Afzaal family, victims of a hate killing last week in London, Ontario. I thank the member for <a data-HoCid="252898" href="/politicians/lindsay-mathyssen/" title="Lindsay Mathyssen">London—Fanshawe</a> for seconding this bill.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">We have seen, tragically, a marked increase in hate in our society: Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, homophobia, transphobia, racism, misogyny. We see racism against Black and indigenous people and rising anti-Asian racism, yet the symbols of hate are freely displayed and freely sold across our country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">It is time to ban these symbols of hate by amending our Criminal Code. This is what this important bill does. It makes it a criminal offence to display or sell reprehensible hate symbols, like the Nazi flag, freely sold in Canada, which is a disgusting symbol of genocidal hatred, anti-Semitism and racism. There should be no place for such flags and emblems representing hate in Canada. They should not be sold. They should not be displayed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">It is time to stop being soft on hate. I hope all MPs will support the bill, the banning symbols of hate act, for speedy passage.</p>
