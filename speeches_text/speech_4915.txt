<p data-HoCid="8576758" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, that is a bit rich coming from a member who claims that Israel has the right to defend itself, but at the same time thinks that every country in the world should ban arms sales to Israel. We cannot have it both ways. Israel is on the front lines of protecting and defending western values and democracy. As a country that also values those things, we should be doing everything we can to help and, in any event, not get in the way of Israel doing what it needs to do.</p>
