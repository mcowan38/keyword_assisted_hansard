<p data-HoCid="6789507" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, incidents of anti-Semitism are on the rise in Canada and the incidents speak for themselves. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6789508" data-originallang="en">The annual Audit of Antisemitic Incidents showed that for the fifth straight year Canada had set a record in 2020 with 2,600 incidents, an increase of more than 18%. Another report showed there were 50 incidents of anti-Semitic activity in the GTA in May alone, a fivefold increase over the previous few months.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6789509" data-originallang="en"> A 21-year-old girl in Montreal stated, “I felt like I’m going to have to hide this fact that I was born in Israel for the rest of my life living in Canada...it was just terrifying.” She said that after being pelted with rocks.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6789510" data-originallang="en">Anti-Semitism is on the rise across Canada and this type of activity cannot be tolerated. Therefore, why is the Liberal Party offering safe harbour to someone who described Israel as a state of apartheid? Why is the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> accepting and welcoming anti-Semitic activity within his own caucus?</p>
