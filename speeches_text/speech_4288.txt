<p data-HoCid="8435199" data-originallang="en"> I can't speak on behalf of the entire Jewish community in Canada, and what you said perfectly are just kinds of ways of looking at anti-Semitism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435200" data-originallang="en"> I'll focus my concern on my own area in the academic community and what I see this leading to. In terms of freedom of expression and freedom of religion people, make a mistake by looking at Jews as people who just practice a religion. Jews are far more than that. They're are a nation. They're a people. They're a culture.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435201" data-originallang="en"> From an academic viewpoint, I'll just mention one thing. As a result of everything that's going on, there has been an astonishing range of discriminatory practices against Jewish academics. These include termination of scientific collaborations, cancellation of conference invitations, refusal to consider scholarly submissions to journals, rejections of promotion evaluations and withdrawals of offers for academic appointments, among many other instances. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8435202" data-originallang="en">From my kind of narrow perspective, this is really a pernicious phenomenon. It is a form of anti-Semitism that suppresses academic freedom within the academy, which will have unbelievable ramifications far beyond Jews.</p>
