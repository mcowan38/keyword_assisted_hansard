<p data-HoCid="8784308" data-originallang="en">I'm using my time to speak to something. If, in a study on freedom of expression, I cannot express my views because Liberals are getting defensive about their position, we have a real problem on our hands. I would argue that the biggest problem is the way in which they blocked further debate and a vote on this critical motion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8784309" data-originallang="en"> Are we forgetting our history? What is critical here is that we recognize the responsibility we have as parliamentarians to uncloak and remove from under the veil of secrecy these Nazis who were protected years after Jews fleeing Europe were not allowed to enter Canada. Canada did not allow Jews to come to Canada to flee what was almost a sure death but instead allowed Nazis to come in.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8784310" data-originallang="en"> We are hearing from a chorus of voices, including from B'nai Brith today, that it is time for Canada—for the Liberal government—to release the names identified in the Deschênes commission. It is absolutely time to do that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8784311" data-originallang="en"> I want to end off my time by sharing the words of a 96-year-old Holocaust survivor, Hedy Bohm, who said the following:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8784312" data-originallang="en"> They let in those Nazis, even at a time when they refused Jewish survivors, but even right now to protect them? Wow. Whose interest is it? Justice doesn't seem to have much success. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8784313" data-originallang="en">Another survivor, Joseph Gottdenker, said, “It's hypocritical. It's not anything more than empty words of government officials who say, 'never again' in public speeches.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8784314" data-originallang="en"> I say never again. I commend the Conservatives for voting with us, and I'm appalled by the Liberals and the Bloc for blocking debate and a vote on releasing the names of the Nazis in the Deschênes commission. Shame.... </p>
