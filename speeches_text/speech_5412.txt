<p data-HoCid="8703055" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Topas, I want to take the opportunity to talk to you about anti-Semitism. Certainly there was anti-Semitism in Canada before October 7, 2023, and there was anti-Semitism in Canada after October 7, 2023.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703056" data-originallang="en"> Since that time, we've seen some pretty ugly stuff happening in our streets, to our schools, to our synagogues, to our institutions and in our neighbourhoods. We have a government that says, on the one hand, that Israel has the right to defend itself, but on the other hand voted for a motion that would deny it the means to defend itself by banning arms permits. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8703057" data-originallang="en">We have a government that is funding UNRWA, even though it's established that UNRWA was complicit in the October 7 attacks and has been teaching young Palestinian children to hate Jews for decades, which has contributed largely to this problem.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703058" data-originallang="en">We're now studying.... In the context of our friend Israel being attacked and 1,200 Israelis being brutally slaughtered and more taken into brutal captivity, the Liberal government thinks it's a good idea to study unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703059" data-originallang="en"> Do you think the policies of this government specifically exacerbate the problem of anti-Semitism in Canada in our streets?</p>
