I know you said here that governments gave significant dollars. I hear that boasted about quite often in the House as well, but sometimes it's better to boast about results.

She actually wrote this in the paper today: “To reduce or eliminate delays at customs, the most useful action we could take would be to remove public health measures and mandatory random testing at the airport. Around the world, 62 countries—including New Zealand, Sweden, Israel and now Austria—have already removed testing and COVID protocols. Canada must do the same” or else perhaps move it off-site.</p>
