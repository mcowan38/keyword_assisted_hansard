<p data-HoCid="8098595" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098596" data-originallang="en">Dr. Kersten, you talked about Canada being a strong proponent of the rules-based international order, and my concern, of course, is the consistency of that: that it happens throughout and that we are seen to do that no matter who's involved. Of course, we're not seeing that, as you mentioned, in the position Canada has taken in terms of the conflict in Israel and Palestine.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098597" data-originallang="en"> Can you explain more about Canada's actions toward the ICC and ICJ in the context of Israel and Palestine, including Canada's submission this summer to the ICJ? Why is there a different response when you compare that to Ukraine and Syria, and what is that impact?</p>
