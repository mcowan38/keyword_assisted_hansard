<p data-HoCid="7774288" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much to all three of our guests for being here today, and thank you for the work you've been doing to hold Vladimir Putin to account for the crimes he has committedâ€”he and Ms. Lvova-Belova.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7774289" data-originallang="en">I also want to express my sympathy and admiration for Ms. Kara-Murza in terms of the horrific news we received: her husband being sentenced to 25 years.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7774290" data-originallang="en">What I'll do is start, perhaps, by asking this: In 2021, the ICC ruled that the court's jurisdiction extended to occupied Palestinian territory. Of course, we think this is a positive step in seeking justice and accountability. Canada has refused to acknowledge the ICC's jurisdiction over Palestine, although most Canadians want to see an ICC investigation into the situation in Israel and Palestine.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7774291" data-originallang="en">At the Assembly of States Parties last year, you said you were planning a trip to Palestine. Do you have any updates on that trip, and have you received any support from member states, such as Canada, for such a visit? Finally, do you agree that the ICC is one of the only legal forums available for Palestinians to seek justice?</p>
