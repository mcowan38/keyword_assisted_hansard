<p data-HoCid="7988193" data-originallang="fr">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988194" data-originallang="fr">I will be speaking to you today about the consular services being provided to Canadians affected by this crisis.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988195" data-originallang="en">Since the onset of the crisis, our missions on the ground in Tel Aviv and Ramallah, and more widely throughout the region, have been providing consular services to Canadians. The emergency watch and response centre here in Ottawa operates 24-7 and has responded to over 8,448 inquiries since the beginning of the conflict on October 7.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988196" data-originallang="en">We immediately surged this team to be able to effectively respond to needs and have had a large team of officers taking calls. For example, in a 24-hour period, we have approximately 100 responders working. We have also deployed approximately 30 members of the standing rapid deployment team to reinforce our missions in Tel Aviv, Ramallah, Athens, Cairo and Beirut, as well as in Cyprus.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988197" data-originallang="fr">These officers are being sent on an emergency basis from Ottawa and our missions in Europe and the region. They are all highly qualified and have been making themselves available for these assignments. We are grateful to them for their efforts, which are often carried out under extremely difficult conditions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988198" data-originallang="en">To ensure clear and timely communications during this crisis, we've set up a dedicated web page on GAC's external website. It includes the most up-to-date information. and we've been encouraging everyone to seek details there. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7988199" data-originallang="en">The travel advice and advisory web pages for Israel, Gaza and West Bank, as well as neighbouring countries, are being continually reviewed and updated as needed. For Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, the overall travel advice is to avoid non-essential travel due to the unpredictable security situation. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7988200" data-originallang="en">In addition, there are regional advisories to avoid all travel to the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, and to borders with Egypt, Lebanon, Syria and the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988201" data-originallang="fr"> Canadians in that region and neighbouring areas need to register with the Registration of Canadians Abroad service to receive updates.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988202" data-originallang="fr">At the moment, there are approximately 6,000 registered Canadians in Israel, and over 450 registered in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988203" data-originallang="fr">Of these, we are currently assisting 900 Canadian citizens, permanent residents, and their families. Through various forms of communication, including the Registration of Canadians Abroad service, we are in direct contact with those who have been affected.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988204" data-originallang="en"> Global Affairs is providing support to six Canadian families following deaths in the current hostilities, and to the families of two other Canadians who are reported missing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988205" data-originallang="en">The Government of Canada's first priority is always the safety and security of its citizens. For this reason, we have not been commenting on or releasing any information that may compromise the ongoing efforts to return these Canadians to safety.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988206" data-originallang="en">Regarding assisted departures from the region, Global Affairs Canada officials continue to be in regular contact with Canadian citizens and permanent residents who've requested help in leaving Israel, the West Bank or the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988207" data-originallang="fr">I'll begin with an update on assisted departures from Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988208" data-originallang="fr">We have thus far helped over 1,600 Canadians, permanent residents and members of their families to leave Israel. By the end of today 19 Canadian Armed Forces flights will have left Tel Aviv for Athens.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988209" data-originallang="en">As was communicated by <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">Minister Joly</a> on Saturday evening, we have been closely monitoring the demand for flights out of Tel Aviv. Now that many Canadians have successfully left Israel, the demand is decreasing and commercial options are becoming increasingly available. Therefore, the last scheduled assisted-departure flight from Tel Aviv is taking place today. Canadian Armed Forces aircraft will remain in the region on standby to rapidly respond should conditions change.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988210" data-originallang="en">For the Gaza Strip, the situation remains extremely fluid, and the Rafah border crossing remains closed to foreign nationals seeking to leave.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988211" data-originallang="fr">We are going to continue to communicate directly with Canadians who want to leave the region. We know that they are facing extremely difficult conditions, and we are doing everything we can to support them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988212" data-originallang="en">We continue to work around the clock to secure a window for Canadians to exit Gaza. We continue to communicate directly with Canadians, giving them the latest information as it becomes available. We are working hard with our allies, with the UN and governments in the region to ensure that Canadians will be able to take advantage of this window.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988213" data-originallang="en">We are encouraged that some humanitarian convoys have entered through the crossing. It's an important first step toward the eventual movement of foreign nationals out of the area. Our mission in Cairo continues to engage with Egyptian authorities to ensure that any Canadians can pass through the Rafah crossing and will be transported to Cairo and onward to Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988214" data-originallang="en">For the assisted-departure options from the West Bank, we've been assisting the departure by land of Canadians, permanent residents and their family members from the West Bank into Jordan. Our mission in Ramallah continues to be in direct contact with all Canadians in the West Bank who are seeking support to leave.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988215" data-originallang="en">While we are prioritizing Canadians for assisted departures, we are also supporting permanent residents and working to ensure that family units are not separated. When determining the eligibility for assisted departures, we follow the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, which defines “family members”. All people looking for this assistance who are in touch with our call centre are made aware of who is eligible under the IRPA.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988216" data-originallang="en">In the process of preparing for these assisted departures, we have been prioritizing documented and travel-ready passengers, stranded tourists and our most vulnerable clients. Canadians are not being charged for the assisted-departure flights from Israel to Athens or transit from the West Bank into Jordan. However, onward travel and accommodation are at the individual's personal expense.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988217" data-originallang="en">Finally, I would like to speak briefly about the situation in Lebanon. There continues to be insecurity at the southern border with Israel and, as we saw with protests and violence in Beirut last week, the situation in Lebanon continues to be unstable.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988218" data-originallang="en">We have now changed our travel advice to advise against all travel to Lebanon. We've amplified this message through social media and direct messages to registered Canadians in Lebanon. Our best advice is that Canadians should not travel to Lebanon for any reason.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988219" data-originallang="en">For those Canadians who are already in Lebanon, we strongly advise that they seek commercial options to leave as soon as possible.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988220" data-originallang="en">Whole-of-government planning is actively taking place to prepare for all scenarios. We have also pre-positioned our standing rapid deployment team officers in the region, and the department has stood up an emergency response team specifically focused on contingency planning for Lebanon.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988221" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much. We'll be pleased to take your questions.</p>
