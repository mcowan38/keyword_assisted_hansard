<p data-HoCid="8075782" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8075783" data-originallang="fr">As you know, I was the first to call for Laith Marouf's contract to be cancelled when this information was revealed. The NDP took it very seriously and called for the contract to be cancelled.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8075784" data-originallang="fr">I support what Mr. Champoux said. I think the comments were unacceptable from someone who has a contract to combat racism and anti-Semitism. This person has shown his racism and anti-Semitism repeatedly.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8075785" data-originallang="fr"> In my opinion, the most important thing is to do everything possible to recover the $130,000. It is extremely important and it has to get done. I know that we will be hearing the <a data-HoCid="300004" href="/politicians/pascale-st-onge/" title="Pascale St-Onge">Minister of Canadian Heritage</a> next Thursday, November 30. In seven days, we will be able to ask the Minister and department officials these questions. This is extremely important and much anticipated.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8075786" data-originallang="en">Because I was the first to call for the cancellation of the contract because of his despicable racist and anti-Semitic views, I believe it is extremely important that we get that money back. We have the <a data-HoCid="300004" href="/politicians/pascale-st-onge/" title="Pascale St-Onge">minister</a> coming next Thursday. That is vitally important.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8075787" data-originallang="en">I think it is an issue on which all four parties around this table agree. That money, by every means possible, needs to be taken back for taxpayers. The fact that we have the <a data-HoCid="300004" href="/politicians/pascale-st-onge/" title="Pascale St-Onge">minister</a> coming next Thursday gives us that opportunity to ask those questions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8075788" data-originallang="en"> I have to say how disappointed I am that, yet again, we have the CRTC before us and yet again, it was cut off. The opportunity to ask questions of the CRTC about the affordability of cellphones or about the broadcasting situation in our country that is in crisis, all of that was cut off by a motion that is, as Mr. Champoux pointed out, simply another motion that, instead of getting to the heart of the matter, which is getting the money back, is intended to go fishing to try to find some other headline.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8075789" data-originallang="en">What our committee should be doing is pressing the <a data-HoCid="300004" href="/politicians/pascale-st-onge/" title="Pascale St-Onge">minister</a> on the important obligation that this government has to get that money back. I deplore the fact that the money has not been recuperated, and I intend to ask the minister about that at the meeting she will be attending next Thursday.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8075790" data-originallang="en">The motion that has been presented is factually incorrect. It wasn't “a number of MPs”; it was me. I was the one who asked the question about the date.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8075791" data-originallang="en"> The answer satisfies me, whether or not there were a few hours between the email and the information. That, to me, is not relevant. What is relevant is getting the money back for taxpayers. What is relevant is ensuring that a notorious anti-Semite—anyone who has expressed anti-Semitic or racist views—never gets a government contract again.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8075792" data-originallang="en">We are seeing a rise in hate. We are seeing a rise in Islamophobia. We are seeing a rise in anti-Semitism. We are seeing a rise in racism and misogyny. We are seeing a rise in homophobia and transphobia. Hate, in all of its appalling toxic forms, is appearing now. That is what this committee should be taking on.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8075793" data-originallang="en">We have a safe sport study that we haven't completed, because at every single meeting, there's another motion from the Conservatives that cuts short our ability to complete the safe sport study. We were not able to complete our questioning of the CRTC today because of another Conservative motion. It's every single time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8075794" data-originallang="en"> Mrs. Thomas said she would make this committee “hell”. She was very public about that. We are seeing how that plays out in real form.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8075795" data-originallang="en"> It means the athletes who suffered so much have still been waiting for months and months. In every committee meeting, there's another Conservative motion designed for their internal purposes, I guess. They put it out on TikTok. I don't know. However, they are blocking the safe sport study—</p>
