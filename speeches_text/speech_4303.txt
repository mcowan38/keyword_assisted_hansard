<p data-HoCid="8435310" data-originallang="en">I interview Holocaust survivors. One of the survivors I interviewed many years ago was David Shentow. He said that when people say they're going to kill you and they hate you, believe them. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8435311" data-originallang="en">I would ask anyone who has any authority and leadership to lead on this issue. When you're hearing things in our universities that are hateful and that are threatening to our students, faculty and staff, believe them, take them seriously and act with whatever ability you have to act. </p>
