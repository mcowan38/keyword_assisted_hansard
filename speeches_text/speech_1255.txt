<p data-HoCid="6865484" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I would like to congratulate the hon. member for<a data-HoCid="278731" href="/politicians/melissa-lantsman/" title="Melissa Lantsman"> Thornhill</a> and commend her on her remarks. I noticed that she made reference to the importance of recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. I think that is so important. I appreciate her remarks on that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6865485" data-originallang="en">Could the hon. member speak further to the importance of the relationship that historically exists between Canada and Israel and go into the future potential of that?</p>
<p data-HoCid="6865486" data-originallang="en"> I also appreciated her remarks related to those who were left out of the speech, that they need to be at the table, including those who live in rural Canada and work in our resource sector.</p>
