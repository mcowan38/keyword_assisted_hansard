<p data-HoCid="6791760" data-originallang="en">We know that Hamas has been controlling Gaza now for well over a decade, and it has maintained its control and been able to function because of the flow of money, the flow of material support—and that can include weapons—into Gaza. We are concerned about all of those things that you mentioned.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791761" data-originallang="en">I draw the chair's attention to the recent past, a few years ago, when a number of tunnels were discovered in Egypt along the Rafah area along the border, and we learned of material support in all manner of items being smuggled in through well-established tunnels. Goods and money going into Gaza and supporting Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad are profoundly concerning, and continue to be a significant concern for us and indeed for the Israelis. It is also one of the reasons why it is difficult to get assistance into Gaza. It has to be done in a way that does not in any way contribute to the capabilities of Hamas.</p>
