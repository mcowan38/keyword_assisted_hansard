<p data-HoCid="8139428" data-originallang="en">I thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8139429" data-originallang="en">I thank all the witnesses for being here. Of course, there are always some shenanigans that happen during committees, so thank you for your patience.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8139430" data-originallang="en">Mr. Imseis, you spoke about the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice. We know that those are two of the only options Palestinians have to actually have non-violent or pacific dispute settlement. Would it not be in the best interests of all to utilize those mechanisms, to support the ICC and the ICJ, to have Canada give that support? Perhaps you could talk about that and the implications when we support those calls within Ukraine and don't support them in other contexts, like in Palestine.</p>
