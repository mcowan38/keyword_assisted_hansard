<p data-HoCid="7166505" data-originallang="en">I was actually not surprised that the Conservatives intervened because their whole position here has been to deny climate science, so they got a guy whose Twitter feed is of full of ridiculing the crisis and calling it “woke capitalism”. The fact that he's claiming that there is no science on this is ridiculous. It's something that will go well with the Conservatives. I was actually trying to figure out where Mr. McTeague gets his science from. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7166506" data-originallang="en">He says that “people are waking up”. He refers to “the <em>gilets jaunes</em>” in France—the yellow vesters. I kind of remembered them, so I looked them up. CNN says the yellow vesters are fanning the flames of anti-Semitism in France. ABC says that the yellow vesters are “dogged by intolerance [and] extremism”. France 24 says violence is seen as legitimate by the yellow vesters.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7166507" data-originallang="en">I want it on the record that the person they brought here to represent their interests on affordability says that the people we need to be learning from are the extremists in France who believe that violence is okay. He says that science is ridiculous and that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a group of extremists. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7166508" data-originallang="en">Enough said. Thanks. I don't need any more time. </p>
