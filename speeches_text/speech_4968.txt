<p data-HoCid="8598761" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, after nine years, the NDP-Liberals are making Canada unsafe. Violent crime is up 50%, and, under the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, hate crimes are up 251%.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8598762" data-originallang="en"> To make matters worse, the NDP-Liberals are allowing a terrorist organization to operate freely within our borders, refusing to list Samidoun as a terrorist organization under the Anti-terrorism Act. Israel and Germany have already listed Samidoun as a terrorist organization. The EU deported the leadership of Samidoun. What exactly are the NDP-Liberals waiting for?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8598763" data-originallang="en"> Common-sense Conservatives would ban Samidoun under the Anti-terrorism Act and make sure that it does not operate within our borders. We would protect Canadians of all faiths and all cultures, bring home safe streets and ensure that Canadians can live in peace within our communities.</p>
