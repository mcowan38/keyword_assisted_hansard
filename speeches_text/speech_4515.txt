<p data-HoCid="8426688" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I am tabling a petition on behalf of constituents in my riding who are concerned about the horrific situation right now in Gaza, where over 73,000 Gazans have been injured and over 34,000 have died, over 70% of them women and children. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8426689" data-originallang="en">The petitioners are calling on the Government of Canada to investigate whether Canadian weapons or weapon components have been used against Palestinian civilians in the occupied Palestinian territory, including during the current war on Gaza, and to close loopholes that allow the unregulated and unreported transfer of military goods to Israel through the United States. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8426690" data-originallang="en">The petitioners are citing that the Liberals have an obligation to prevent genocide. The killings must be stopped, and Canada must do everything possible to end this conflict now, including with a two-way arms embargo, immediate sanctions and supporting the ICC and ICJ. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8426691" data-originallang="en">Both Palestinians and Israelis deserve peace, justice and safety. The petitioners are calling for the release of hostages and a ceasefire now.</p>
