<p data-HoCid="7023216" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague touched upon grocery outlets and big-box stores, as did her colleague for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> who spoke before her. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7023217" data-originallang="en">One of the things that we are studying right now at the agriculture committee, and which was brought up today, is that sometimes retailers are unfair to suppliers in terms of their expectations and some of the additional costs. That has given rise to the idea of a grocery code of conduct. The member for <a data-HoCid="278446" href="/politicians/marilyn-gladu/" title="Marilyn Gladu">Sarnia-Lambton</a> actually read out a passage where, with the CP Rail strike and the fact that there could be disruptions, the retailer was still expecting the producer to provide the product with basically no recognition that there could be a disruption.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7023218" data-originallang="en">My question is twofold for the member opposite. Would she support the idea of a grocery code of conduct to try to create a regulatory environment for larger chains, to have some type of recourse available to producers? Vis-Ã -vis the CP Rail strike, does the member think that at some point the government will have to move in to protect collective interests and maintain rail services across the country?</p>
