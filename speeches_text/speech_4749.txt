<p data-HoCid="8572709" data-originallang="en"> That's a really good question. There are a variety of links between the far right and the Russian government. The Russian government has engaged in significant disinformation efforts that have been facilitating the far right.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8572710" data-originallang="en"> Why does the far right find Putin attractive? Part of the far right's endeavour is to delegitimize existing institutions. They're also proto-authoritarian, so they find Putin's efforts to be helpful and they find Putin to be a model. They want to have an authoritarian regime that's far right. They're anti-democratic.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8572711" data-originallang="en"> Viktor Orb√°n has been at the forefront of this. Hungary has led the movement on democratic backsliding. He's been fond of talking about illiberal democracy. He's been very fond of using homophobia, anti-Semitism and other forms of hatred to mobilize support for his regime and to undermine his opponents and to do that in the neighbourhood as well.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8572712" data-originallang="en">That playbook has been imitated by far-right politicians in Europe and North America. It's not an accident these days that trans people are demonized. It's not an accident that anti-Semitism is rising. It's not an accident that Islamophobia is rising. All these things travel together. Putin's ideology is very similar to the ideology by the far-right political movements in the United States, Canada and Europe.</p>
