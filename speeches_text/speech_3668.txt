<p data-HoCid="8276265" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, today I will read into the record what legal expert Dr. Ardi Imseis said about the legal framework for Palestinian statehood. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8276266" data-originallang="en">He stated, “Palestine is recognized by 140 states. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8276267" data-originallang="en">“Palestine is a juridical fact. Its territory is under illegal foreign military occupation by Israel, but that does not mean that the State of Palestine does not exist in law. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8276268" data-originallang="en">“It possesses all four of the criterion for statehood as codified in the 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States: (1) a permanent population; (2) a territory; (3) a government; and (4) the capacity to enter into foreign relations with other states. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8276269" data-originallang="en">“Successive Israeli governments have, for years, indicated that they will never allow the establishment of an independent Palestinian state and that only the Jewish people have a right to self-determination in the land between the river and the sea. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8276270" data-originallang="en">“This is unlawful. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8276271" data-originallang="en">“As a peremptory norm, no people's right to self-determination in their own territory can be the subject of negotiation under international law. This is the last chance Canada has to save the two state framework set in motion by the UN in 1947.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8276272" data-originallang="en"> Where will the Liberal government stand today on Palestine's statehood?</p>
