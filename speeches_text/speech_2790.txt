<p data-HoCid="7988375" data-originallang="fr">Since the attack on October 7, Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed 4,651 Palestinians, almost half of whom were children. There were also a reported 14,245 injured and 29 UN employees killed in the region. Of course, we musn't forget that these numbers come from the Gaza Ministry of Health.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988376" data-originallang="fr">Ms. Flanagan Whalen, you talked about proportionality a little earlier. Before condemning the facts I have just reported, I'd like you to tell me whether we are still doing proportionality calculations.</p>
