<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, for many, the sacred place of worship is Jerusalem, Mecca or Varanasi. For the Sikh community, that place is the Harmandir Sahib, globally known as the Golden Temple.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">However, in June 1984, the most sacred place of worship for Sikhs was stormed in an orchestrated military operation. In this gruesome attack, thousands were killed, many at point-blank range, and the sarovar turned red with blood. The Akal Takht was blasted. The Sikh Reference Library, containing thousands of manuscripts, paintings and scriptures, was torched to the ground. Forty other gurdwaras around the country were also attacked, and, 39 years later, Sikhs around the world still remember this tragic day.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">The Sikh community will forever send its prayers to the victims of this massacre, while also praying that such a dreadful attack on a place of worship never happens again. We shall never forget 1984.</p>
