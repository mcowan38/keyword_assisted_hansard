<p data-HoCid="8742045" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, today is the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, and today, I am reaffirming my support for Canada's recognition for Palestinian statehood. Canada recently voted in favour of two UN resolutions to signal our deep concerns over the expansion of Israeli settlements into the occupied Palestinian territories and to express our unwavering support for Palestinian refugees, who are in urgent need of assistance. UNRWA is critical in that regard.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8742046" data-originallang="en"> Canada remains committed to the pursuit of lasting peace in the Middle East. A two-state solution is critical to that endeavour, which includes the creation of a Palestinian state where Palestinians and Israelis live side-by-side in peace, security and dignity. The Netanyahu government has made it clear, with its words and actions, that it rejects a two-state solution, while illegal settlements and violence in the West Bank are on the rise.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8742047" data-originallang="en"> Canada does not recognize permanent Israeli control over the West Bank, East Jerusalem or Gaza. We must see progress toward Palestinian self-determination. We need a ceasefire and sustained humanitarian aid. All hostages must be released. Peace in the Middle East is possible, and the recognition of a Palestinian state is an important step toward it.</p>
