<p data-HoCid="8018839" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8018840" data-originallang="en"> I'll be brief.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8018841" data-originallang="en">We originally were calling her for an hour. It's simply not enough time. I am concerned that they continue not to call Hamas “terrorists”, even though they're listed as an organization. I'm concerned about the false reporting that the Israel Defense Forces bombed a hospital when in fact that didn't happen, and there's been no retraction. I would like to ask questions of Ms. Tait about the many reports that have been done, the surveys and summaries, stating that the CBC is partisan or left-leaning. Finally, I want to talk about how the CBC is not going to interfere in the next election by not suing the Conservative Party in the middle of a federal election.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8018842" data-originallang="en">Those are the questions I'm looking for. We're going to need three hours. I do support this motion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8018843" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
