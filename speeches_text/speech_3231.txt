<p data-HoCid="8100503" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100504" data-originallang="fr">As I've said before, I may be alone on this. I, too, am very concerned about the situation we're seeing around the world, particularly the acts of antisemitism committed in recent weeks. In fact, such acts have been going on for a long time. I personally find them abhorrent. The same goes for acts against Muslims or any other religion. Religions should encourage us to unite and work together in harmony. I don't want to use clichés, but I would say that they should encourage us to love one another rather than seek to harm, hurt or kill one another. It all seems abhorrent to me, and I agree that we should do everything in our power to fight against such acts.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100505" data-originallang="fr">That said, I think we need to proceed rationally. As I said earlier, I'm sympathetic to the arguments raised by Mr. Moore, but I think they're a bit hasty. There are a lot of things in there that aren't even within the purview of our committee. Unless I'm mistaken, I believe the list of terrorist entities is the responsibility of the Minister of Public Safety. There's also the financing of infrastructure projects. There are various items that don't fall under the purview of our committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100506" data-originallang="fr">On the other hand, we have not received any witnesses on this subject. But even if we are sensitive to these issues, we must be rigorous in our work, in my opinion. Before adopting a motion that makes or supports allegations, we would have to call witnesses. If we didn't do this, all our studies would be useless. All we'd have to do is ask ourselves if we're sensitive to a situation and then produce a report.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100507" data-originallang="fr">For my part, I think it's too quick and that witnesses should be called. What's more, I'm not sure that all this falls within the remit of our committee. I'm aware that, for all sorts of reasons that I don't understand or that perhaps don't concern me, the Liberals and Conservatives will support this motion. It will therefore be adopted. I'd like to say that I'm very sensitive to these arguments, but that it's hasty, in my opinion, and that we'd be better off hearing from witnesses over the course of one or two sessions before making a decision.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100508" data-originallang="fr">We're here to look at Bill <a data-HoCid="12237277" href="/bills/44-1/C-40/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code, to make consequential amendments to other Acts and to repeal a regulation (miscarriage of justice reviews)">C‑40</a>. Now, this isn't a motion we can easily make a decision on in two minutes. There's substance here. We're talking about 700 Iranian agents. Who are these agents? There are many questions we need to consider seriously. In my opinion, it's not serious to make a decision after simply hearing our respective states of mind.</p>
