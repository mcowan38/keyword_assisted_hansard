<p data-HoCid="7640464" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7640465" data-originallang="fr">Thank you for inviting me and for putting the topic of sexual and reproductive health and rights on your committee's agenda.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7640466" data-originallang="fr">Oxfam-Québec and Oxfam Canada are members of the Oxfam confederation, whose mission is to fight inequality to end poverty, particularly through the power of women, for sustainable solutions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7640467" data-originallang="fr">We believe that reproductive justice is linked to social justice and that gender justice cannot be achieved without bodily autonomy and sexual and reproductive rights. The numbers speak for themselves: 7 million women are hospitalized every year owing to unsafe abortion, and far too many die.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7640468" data-originallang="fr">According to the World Health Organization, complications from pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause of death for young girls. Teen pregnancy carries a higher risk than adult pregnancy. It has a significant impact on their lives, future, education and autonomy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7640469" data-originallang="fr">Oxfam-Québec and Oxfam Canada are conducting two major projects on sexual and reproductive health and rights, which are taking place in different regions of the world. Funding from Global Affairs Canada and our donors enables our organizations to implement these projects, which focus on adolescent girls and young women, especially those who are most marginalized, under the leadership of those who are on the frontline.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7640470" data-originallang="fr">There are many barriers to the realization of sexual and reproductive rights, but it is discrimination against women and marginalized groups that underlies these problems. Ensuring sexual and reproductive rights is a critical pathway to not only making women's rights tangible, but also enabling women to build resilient communities and economic autonomy and to participate in crisis and conflict resolution.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7640471" data-originallang="fr">In the wake of a pandemic that has exacerbated inequalities, and in a global context weakened by “polycrises” and more restrictive laws for sexual and reproductive rights, this area is increasingly less of a budgetary priority for governments and donors, even though it is among the critical solutions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7640472" data-originallang="fr">Without a collective effort, we will continue to see access to sexual and reproductive health services and rights increasingly impeded, if not impossible, leading to an increase in unwanted pregnancies, deaths, unsafe abortions, cases of gender-based violence, and impacts on the physical and mental health and education of girls and young women.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7640473" data-originallang="fr">Oxfam-Québec has begun implementation of power to choose, a seven-year program for reproductive and sexual rights that is supported by partners such as the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada. The program has a component in Quebec and relies on partnerships with local organizations based in Honduras, Ghana, Bolivia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Jordan, Lebanon and the occupied Palestinian territories.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7640474" data-originallang="en"> Through the Her Future, Her Choice project, Oxfam Canada and its partners work to advance comprehensive approaches to sexual and reproductive rights in Ethiopia, Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7640475" data-originallang="en">Both projects respond to gender inequality and women's rights violations by directly addressing barriers that hinder access to sexual and reproductive rights in program communities and fragile, restrained civic spaces. These barriers include harmful social norms, traditional practices, taboos about gender and sexuality, lack of access to sexual and reproductive health information and education services, and a lack of meaningful decision-making power for adolescent girls and young women regarding their own health and sexuality.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7640476" data-originallang="en">Canada has made significant contributions to support sexual health and reproductive rights internationally. We must continue to be a leader among donor countries. The government should remain dedicated to ensuring that it meets its $700-million commitment for sexual and reproductive health, with a focus on the neglected areas, and to tracking its investments. As it stands, the government will need to aggressively scale up funding in these areas to meet the target by the 2024 deadline.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7640477" data-originallang="fr">This investment should also cover the strengthening of universal health coverage to ensure continuity of sexual and reproductive health services, particularly in the context of health emergencies and crises, which, as we know, are increasing. It should also support and include local youth and women's organizations, as well as LGBTQ+ organizations, in decision-making spaces to ensure effective and sustainable mobilization, even in small civic spaces.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7640478" data-originallang="fr">Canada must fund transformative gender programs and intersectional research related to the health of adolescents, women and people of diverse backgrounds with flexible, long-term budgeting.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7640479" data-originallang="fr">Thank you for listening. We will be happy to answer your questions.</p>
