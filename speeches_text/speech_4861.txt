<p data-HoCid="8576345" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the comments from the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278368" href="/politicians/heather-mcpherson/" title="Heather McPherson">Edmonton Strathcona</a> were bang on.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576346" data-originallang="en">Further, in a lot of the questions that she tried to answer following the hon. member, it was very clear that Canada has actually shown itself, on the world stage, to follow rulings of the ICC and the ICJ for other countries in some regards. It has followed through and tried to put forward sanctions in the case of Ukraine, although not as successfully as we would like. They have been supportive.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576347" data-originallang="en">I would ask for that consistency when it comes to Gaza, Palestine, Lebanon and everyone across this globe.</p>
