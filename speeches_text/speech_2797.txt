<p data-HoCid="7988392" data-originallang="en">There are multiple complications, in the sense of.... Ramallah is one part of the West Bank, and certainly we moved quickly. The first bus of Canadians and also some Australians out of Ramallah happened for those were individuals who were in that area because we were able to move really quickly.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988393" data-originallang="en">There are Canadians across the West Bank, so we've been working to support them. There are challenges because of checkpoints and other issues. We've been working closely with a group called COGAT, the Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories. It's an Israeli group, because we have to be sure that we are alerting them of our movements so that they're able to support us. They, of course, liaise with the IDF. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7988394" data-originallang="en">We also work closely with our colleagues at the UN who are responsible for security. We have very good relationships with them. They are on the ground. We are sharing information all the time to be able to ensure that Canadians can move effectively in the West Bank. We have transported people from Bethlehem to the border with Jordan, where we have our mission there collecting people. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7988395" data-originallang="en">One additional complexity in the case of the West Bank is that we also have IRCC officials with us on site in Ramallah so that they are able to do approvals of family members. That can take a bit of extra time, but we've been doing that really quickly. We've been able to move even mixed families across the border with Jordan, and that's something that is great. In the early days, we needed to do our homework to ensure we were able to do that safely without creating issues for people. We wanted to ensure their security and safety across that whole movement, which was and is quite complex. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7988396" data-originallang="en">We now understand it quite well, which is why our allies are asking us for advice on how to do that.</p>
