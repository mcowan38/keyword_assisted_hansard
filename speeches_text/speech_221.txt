<blockquote><p data-HoCid="6253948" data-originallang="en"> That the House: </p>
<p data-HoCid="6253949" data-originallang="en"> (a) officially recognize that the Nazis and their collaborators systematically murdered over 500,000 Romani during the Holocaust and that this atrocity constitutes a genocide against the Romani people; </p>
<p data-HoCid="6253950" data-originallang="en"> (b) pay tribute to those Romani who were murdered as well as the Romani survivors of persecution by the Nazis; and </p>
<p data-HoCid="6253951" data-originallang="en"> c) recognize August 2 as the official date to commemorate the Romani Genocide, also known as Porajmos and Samudaripen, to never forget the atrocities committed against the Romani people, the harrowing stories of victims, and the incredible strength of survivors. </p>
