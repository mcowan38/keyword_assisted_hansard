<p data-HoCid="6750343" data-originallang="en">Yes. At this stage, I would point to the U.K. They probably have the best model in place. They're using a traffic light system. Green is for 12 low-risk countries. They'll open first to low-risk countries, where you have to test negative and then you have no quarantine. Amber is for countries that are moderate risk, so you must self-isolate for 10 days. Red is for countries that are high risk, where you would still need to have a hotel quarantine, as an example.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6750344" data-originallang="en">They have a system where they're going to open up to nations who have comparably low levels of risk. I think that would be the model we would recommend, but there are others too. I would be happy to follow up with the committee on a few others as well, including Israel and others.</p>
