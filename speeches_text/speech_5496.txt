<p data-HoCid="8723515" data-originallang="en"> Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8723516" data-originallang="en">I would like to use my time to move a motion for which you've all received notice. It's with regard to Canada's ongoing protection of Nazis who were allowed to enter Canada during and in the immediate aftermath of the Holocaust. This is a shameful part of our history, and I urge all my colleagues to support this motion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8723517" data-originallang="en">We just marked Remembrance Day. We all, I'm sure, attended ceremonies honouring the Canadian soldiers who served our country. We vowed never to forget the sacrifices of the many Canadians who served and died throughout history. This year also marked the 80th anniversary of D-Day and the historic Battle of Normandy, in which Canadians played a pivotal role in liberating Europe and the world from fascism. The Battle of Normandy came at a heavy cost. Some 19,000 Canadians were killed or wounded by the Nazis.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8723518" data-originallang="en">In France, they remember. It was very emotional for me and my family when, on a private visit this summer, we heard the playing of <em>O Canada</em> and heard the appreciation of a town liberated by Canadian soldiers. Eighty years later, they remember. They remember what the fight against Nazism and fascism was all about.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8723519" data-originallang="en">This is personal for many of us. Today, I can't stop thinking of many members of my family who fought the Nazis. They knew what was at stake. It was the very future of humanity itself.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8723520" data-originallang="en"> I think of my family and my community. I think of my family in Greece, who suffered under the Nazi occupation and fascist brutality. I think of the Jewish communities across Greece and in the village next to my <em>pappos</em>, my grandfathers, who were wiped out by the Holocaust. It was an absolute result of Nazi ideology. I think of others who have family members who were victims of the Nazis, or the family who never got that opportunity to come to Canada because they were turned away by a country that was far too comfortable saying no to Jews, the victims of the Holocaust, but yes to too many perpetrators.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8723521" data-originallang="en">Canadians deserve to know how, according to the Deschênes commission, Nazis were welcomed into this country. Many Jewish, Polish and Ukrainian organizations have been clear that the names need to be released, yet Library and Archives Canada, which is under the Minister of Canadian Heritage, said no.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8723522" data-originallang="en">This is shameful, so I want to move my motion. I move that “Given that the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage regrets the continued protection given by the Minister of Canadian Heritage to the estimated 900 Nazis that were allowed to enter Canada after the Second World War”, etc., be supported in this meeting today.</p>
