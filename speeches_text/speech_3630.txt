<p data-HoCid="8277004" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, when we saw what happened in Israel following the heinous attacks by Hamas on October 7, and when we see what is happening to innocent civilians in Gaza who are also victims of Hamas's violent ideology, our hearts go out to all the innocent people who are suffering, especially because many of those suffering are women and children.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8277005" data-originallang="en">Conservatives want peace in the region, and we believe that, ultimately, this would be achieved through a two-state solution, negotiated and agreed upon by both sides. However, we also know this can only happen once Hamas and other terrorist organizations are removed from power. We know this can only happen when Israelis and Palestinians can be guaranteed peace and security, living side by side. This has been the policy of Canada for decades, under both Liberal and Conservative governments, yet it is the policy that this motion seeks to upend.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8277006" data-originallang="en">Will the member admit that by abandoning this policy, this motion would do nothing to bring peace and security to Israelis and Palestinians?</p>
