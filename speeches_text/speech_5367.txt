<p data-HoCid="8703220" data-originallang="en"> Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703221" data-originallang="en">Dr. Awad, I want to thank you for being here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703222" data-originallang="en">I recognize that this has been a devastating year for Palestinians worldwide, including in Canada, who face an ongoing genocide not just in Gaza but obviously in the apartheid system in the occupied territories in the West Bank.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703223" data-originallang="en">You spoke about the legal implications and the moral imperative. I would like you to take a moment and tell us what the Canadian Palestinian community has experienced this year and what statehood recognition by the Government of Canada would mean to them in this moment.</p>
