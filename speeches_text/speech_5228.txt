<p data-HoCid="8679193" data-originallang="en"> However, that doesn't obviate the need to reach out to Palestinians now and as soon as possible. It's as simple as that. One person suffering doesn't mean that another person isn't also suffering.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679194" data-originallang="en"> I can only repeat that Israel's security can only be guaranteed.... You don't have to listen to me. Former prime ministers Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert, 500 former Mossad chiefs, heads of the Shin Bet and heads of IDF have all said that the threat is from within. They are all arguing for opening discussions with the Palestinians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679195" data-originallang="en"> As I said, it's not going to be easy, but it has to begin and it has to be real.</p>
