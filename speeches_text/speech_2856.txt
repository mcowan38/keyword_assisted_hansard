<p data-HoCid="7988269" data-originallang="fr">As I mentioned earlier, various proposals are being looked at, including humanitarian corridors and a ceasefire.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988270" data-originallang="en">We will call upon all parties to continue to respect international humanitarian law. We will call upon all parties to protect civilians. We are deeply concerned, evidently, about the humanitarian situation in this region. Our priority is ensuring that humanitarian assistance can reach those in need. Those are the conversations that we are party to right now. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7988271" data-originallang="en">We think we need to make it clear that Israel, following this horrible terrorist attack, has the right to defend itself according to the principles of international law. That is central for us as well, and we are profoundly preoccupied with Israel's security in the region. Without security for Israel, there is no sustainable peace in this region either. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7988272" data-originallang="en">We need to continue to impress on the players of the region the need for respect for international humanitarian law and for humanitarian access, and that will continue to be the conversation. </p>
