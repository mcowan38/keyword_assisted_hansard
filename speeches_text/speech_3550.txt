<p data-HoCid="8244384" data-originallang="en">It's a very sober time for a lot of people who have histories of trauma, and it is a complex subject that I recognize has caused a lot of pain for multiple communities in Canada and around the world. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8244385" data-originallang="en">In terms of being able to criticize any side or speaking up for Palestinian rights in the face of what the ICJ has called a plausible genocide, if I had solutions for how to make that happen, I think it has to come from a full societal push towards justice, which involves not just media companies but also politicians and unions. It's about keeping an eye on what justice is and how to separate pressure groups from media, not allowing any interference in the process of gathering information fairly and accurately on any side of any conflict. That has become a challenge.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8244386" data-originallang="en">Right now on this particular issue, there is often a Palestinian exception to many free news gathering practices, and I have been stunned by the silence in my industry. I have been stunned by the silence in the medical industry, among academics. I don't have the answers to why that is so. It is a much more complicated response than I think I can give you here, but it is very concerning. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8244387" data-originallang="en">One of the pleas I make is for Canada to invest in a free press. That is the only way forward. Canada has the potential to be a world leader in being completely free, pluralistic and independent in its press. We have the potential. I think it's going to require a lot of introspection at individual and collective levels for us to make it happen. </p>
