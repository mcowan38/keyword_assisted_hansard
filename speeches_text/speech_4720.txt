<p data-HoCid="8488607" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I have said many times in the House that the situation in Gaza is catastrophic. Too many children and too many women have died. That is why the violence must stop. That is why we need a ceasefire now. That is why hostages must be released. That is why civilians must be protected. That is why humanitarian aid needs to get into Gaza. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8488608" data-originallang="en">We need to make sure that both parties support the Biden proposal. The <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, and the G7 prime ministers and leaders are in Italy as we speak. I really hope we can bring peace back to the Middle East.</p>
