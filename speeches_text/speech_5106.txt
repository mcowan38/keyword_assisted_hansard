<p data-HoCid="8668857" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8668858" data-originallang="fr">The situation of the francophone minority when it comes to child care in Alberta is very interesting.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8668859" data-originallang="fr">In the NDP, we are proud that <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Leah Gazan</a>, the member for Winnipeg Centre, has proposed an amendment to guarantee that francophones in minority communities would have access to child care in French. Given the waiting lists, however, it is harder for families in Alberta.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8668860" data-originallang="fr">Can you tell us about waiting lists for francophone child care centres?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8668861" data-originallang="en">Perhaps I would start with Madame Maisonneuve, please.</p>
