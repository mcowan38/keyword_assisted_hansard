<p data-HoCid="8805620" data-originallang="fr">That's good, thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8805621" data-originallang="fr"> I also want to clarify something else, just for information. The problem of the shortage of spaces in francophone child care services is very important to all of us in the New Democratic Party. My New Democrat colleague <a data-HoCid="284412" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Leah Gazan</a>, who is also from Manitoba, introduced an amendment to Bill <a data-HoCid="12138647" href="/bills/44-1/C-35/" title="An Act respecting early learning and child care in Canada">C‑35</a> to guarantee access to francophones in minority communities to child care services in French. We worked closely with my colleague. We believe that this must be clearly stated in the act and, of course, that there must be permanent, long-term financial support.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8805622" data-originallang="fr">I want to come back to the question of the current labour shortage. We know that the Université de Saint‑Boniface has an innovative project in connection with this. We also know that all our child care services are making an effort to alleviate this labour shortage. Can you tell us about the current labour shortage and about how important it is to sit all our governments down at the same table to help us find solutions to this shortage?</p>
