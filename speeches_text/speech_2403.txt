<p data-HoCid="7799038" data-originallang="en">I would like to move a motion for a committee study on what actions Canada should take to foster peace and respect for human rights and international law in the region of Israel/Palestine.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7799039" data-originallang="en">The motion was distributed to committee members on April 20.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7799040" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, this motion is supported by a number of faith groups, including the National Council for Canadian Muslims, many Christian churches and Jewish Canadians, and Canadian human rights and humanitarian organizations. Many of them are watching us this morning in the hopes that I will have support from all parties to pass this motion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7799041" data-originallang="en">Today, as you know, is the first anniversary of the death of the Palestinian-American journalist, Shireen Abu Akleh.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7799042" data-originallang="en">The past days and weeks have shown that the region is as far from a peaceful solution as it has ever been and that there are enormous concerns about human rights and respect for international law, including the tax on Palestinian and Israeli civilians. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7799043" data-originallang="en">This is a very challenging topic, and it is one with heightened emotions and serious consequences for many people. It is also a topic that our committee has not studied for at least a few decades, yet it is one that is not only important to many Canadians; it's also integral to Canada's foreign policy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7799044" data-originallang="en">Canada has a role to play in fostering peace and justice, and its new bid for a seat at the United Nations Human Rights Council makes a study like this all the more important.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7799045" data-originallang="en">I understand there may be some discomfort with such a study. This is a difficult issue. However, we are a serious committee. I think we have a duty to listen and to learn from experts, to approach the subject with respect for each other and for all people, and to help find solutions that will lead Canada on the right path.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7799046" data-originallang="en">I am asking today for the support of all members for this motion:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7799047" data-originallang="en"> That, pursuant to Standing Order 108(2), and in light of recent events in Israel and Palestine, the committee conduct a study on the actions Canada should take to foster peace and respect for human rights and international law in the region; that the study consist of at least eight meetings; that the Minister of Foreign Affairs be invited to appear and that the committee invite witnesses from Canadian civil society, international humanitarian organizations, and Israeli and Palestinian human rights organizations; that the committee report its findings to the House, and that pursuant to Standing Order 109 the government table a comprehensive response to the report. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7799048" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, I would find it extremely troubling if members of this committee chose not to study something that is so important with regard to our foreign policy and if this committee made a decision to once again decline to study something that is so vitally important.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7799049" data-originallang="en">I would urge all of my colleagues to think very carefully about how they vote on this motion. Thank you.</p>
