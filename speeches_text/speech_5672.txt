<p data-HoCid="8765375" data-originallang="en">Okay. I am struggling a bit to understand your answer, then, because on the one hand you're saying that you do try to screen out anti-Semitic or other racist content, but on the other hand, you don't have a specific definition of anti-Semitism. How do you screen out anti-Semitic content without having a definition that you're using for anti-Semitism?</p>
