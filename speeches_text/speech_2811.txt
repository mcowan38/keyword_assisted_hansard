<p data-HoCid="7988470" data-originallang="en">There's nothing for civilians to participate in, though. There's no guidance to say that if you donate money to the Red Cross, let's say, for lack of a better name.... Is there anything whereby the government is going to match the contribution for assistance to civilians? The families and the kids are the people I'm looking at right now. I want to make sure that they're kept as safe as possible and are reunited somewhere down the road.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988471" data-originallang="en">Again, if we're proactively looking ahead, there's going to be a day when people in Gaza are going to return to an area that's totally bombed out, that has nothing. What process can we put in to assist them just to make a living, just to survive? Are we proactively looking at anything there?</p>
