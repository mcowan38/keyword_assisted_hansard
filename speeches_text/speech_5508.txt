<p data-HoCid="8672583" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, that is a lovely set of remarks there, and I appreciate my colleague from <a data-HoCid="278569" href="/politicians/ziad-aboultaif/" title="Ziad Aboultaif">Winnipeg South Centre</a>'s comment. I have added a new word to my vocabulary, and I appreciate that very much. Much like my colleague from <a data-HoCid="278450" href="/politicians/tom-kmiec/" title="Tom Kmiec">Calgary Shepherd</a>, I clearly need to use more Yiddish in my expressions around here; I will attempt to do so.</p>
