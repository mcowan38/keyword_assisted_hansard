<p data-HoCid="7345418" data-originallang="en"> Madam Chair, I'll start off. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7345419" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Minister, for presenting today at committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345420" data-originallang="en">Mr. Housefather provided the minister's office with information in July about Mr. Marouf's vile anti-Semitism. After this came to light, a statement was made only on August 22. That's at least 22 days, if Mr. Housefather told the minister's office on July 31.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345421" data-originallang="en"> I want to know what day you were made aware of Mr. Marouf's vile, anti-Semitic hate spewed everywhere, which I think a simple Google search could have turned up.</p>
