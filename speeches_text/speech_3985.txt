<p data-HoCid="8365409" data-originallang="en">I just want to raise the concern, Madam Chair, that we can continue, but if we continue, we will not have the opportunity to go over the witness list for the anti-Semitism study. If we don't do that today and we do it on Thursday, I don't believe there will be time to invite witnesses to be here next Monday. I just want to understand that, when we do get to studying the witness list, we're not going to make the study start the next day, when there's no time for witnesses to be invited properly and to have that discussion, and we give time for the clerk to invite the witnesses, get them their headphones and do this properly.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8365410" data-originallang="en">I would have thought, if we did this today and we resumed the bill on Thursday, we would then have the opportunity to invite the witnesses properly over the next few days and start on Monday. I point out only that, if we get to that on Thursday, we can't expect to start on Monday. </p>
