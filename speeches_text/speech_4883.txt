<p data-HoCid="8609284" data-originallang="en">I think we need to look historically at this phenomenon of parental alienation. It was created in the early eighties by a disgraced psychologist who used the concept of parental alienation as a method to distract from sexual abuse accusations against fathers. It has been used as a vector of abuse against women since then. You can all google who started this; his name was Richard Gardner. He said, “There is a bit of pedophilia in every one of us” and “The child who has suffered bona fide [sexual] abuse may very well have enjoyed the experience”. That is how this started.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8609285" data-originallang="en">This concept of parental alienation has morphed and is used in settings where men are accused by the mom and/or children of abuse. They're false allegations used to distract from the abuse. Sadly, there has been a lot of case law across the world—even here in Canada—where as soon as parental alienation is raised, women are down a rabbit hole.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8609286" data-originallang="en">The word “alienation”, in the setting of abuse, has to be eradicated. The way to do that is to have risk assessments on the front lines so that, from the get-go in these custody battles, we can determine whether or not abuse is present. That—</p>
