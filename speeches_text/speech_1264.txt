<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, it is clear that the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">minister</a> is not getting neutrality. In fact, I wish the government would do what the EU is doing and put its money where its mouth is.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">In September, because of these very concerns about the school materials, the European Union made its UNRWA funding conditional on immediate changes to the Palestinian school curriculum to promote coexistence with Israel. If such changes are not made by early 2022, EU funds will go to NGOs that promote coexistence. Canada could have been a leader on this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Will the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">minister</a>'s government follow the European Union's lead?</p>
