<p data-HoCid="6752370" data-originallang="en"> The easiest one for me to point to is the European Union. In the European Union, there's a hard cap of 30 basis points on any credit card. Not only is that a fifth of the average rate in Canada or thereabouts, but that's a cap, so you would anticipate that it's lower than one-fifth of the rate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6752371" data-originallang="en">It has been 50 basis points in Australia. I haven't checked the recent numbers in Switzerland and Israel, which are obviously both outside the EU, but they were below 100 basis points, or below 1%, so it's very common.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6752372" data-originallang="en">I think there's a tendency for people to look to the U.S. example, which is ground zero, as it were, for this and the last hill to die on for the credit card networks, and I don't think that's a good comparison. I'm not sure we would always look to U.S. regulation of financial players as necessarily the paragon.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6752373" data-originallang="en"> It is certainly on a very broad basis around the worldâ€”mixed economies, more command economies. Parties of left and right have gotten involved in this, because they've seen the competitive problem that was created. It has involved competition authorities and central banks. It's not just a politically driven file in a multitude of countries around the world.</p>
