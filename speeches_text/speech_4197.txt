<p data-HoCid="8434813" data-originallang="en"> Welcome to meeting number 105 of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8434814" data-originallang="en"> Pursuant to Standing Order 108(2) and the motion adopted by the committee on March 21, 2024, the committee is commencing its study on anti-Semitism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8434815" data-originallang="en"> Before we begin, I'd like to remind all members and other meeting participants in the room of the following important preventative measures. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8434816" data-originallang="en">To prevent disruptive and potentially harmful audio feedback incidents that can cause injuries, all in-person participants are reminded to keep their earpieces away from all microphones at all times.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8434817" data-originallang="en"> As indicated in the communiqu√© from the Speaker to all members on Monday, April 29, the following measures have been taken to help prevent audio feedback incidents. All earpieces have been replaced by a model that greatly reduces the probability of audio feedback. The new earpieces are black in colour, whereas the former earpieces were grey. Please only use a black, approved earpiece. By default, all unused earpieces will be unplugged at the start of the meeting. When you're not using your earpiece, please place it face down on the middle of the sticker for this purpose that you will find on the table. Please consult the cards on the table for guidelines.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8434818" data-originallang="en"> These measures are in place so that we can conduct our business without interruption and to protect the health and safety of all participants, including the interpreters. Thank you all for your co-operation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8434819" data-originallang="en"> Today's meeting is taking place in a hybrid format.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8434820" data-originallang="en"> In accordance with the committee's routine motion concerning connection tests for witnesses, because we have witnesses today appearing in person and by video conference, I am informing the committee that I've been informed that all witnesses have completed the required connection tests in advance of the meeting.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8434821" data-originallang="en">For the benefit of the members and the witnesses, please wait until I recognize you by name before speaking.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8434822" data-originallang="en">Before we begin our study, I have one quick business note. The clerk has circulated the budget for the study in the amount of $25,250, and I would seek approval from the committee.</p>
