<p data-HoCid="7200363" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, this weekend over 15,000 in Toronto’s Jewish community gathered for UJA’s Walk with Israel. It is the biggest event of its kind in Canada. Running for more than 50 years, it supports UJA projects that help vulnerable populations in Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7200364" data-originallang="en">While it is one of the most successful events in the community, corresponding with Yom Yerushalayim, which commemorates the reunification of Jerusalem after the Six-Day War, it is also a sober reminder of the exceptional measures that the Jewish community has to take simply to exercise their right to freedom of assembly and expression.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7200365" data-originallang="en">As the most frequently targeted religious minority in Canada, the Jewish community, through UJA, has no choice but to expend significant charitable dollars just to provide the security measures needed for community members to stay safe at the walk. No targeted community should have to pay a security premium simply to exercise their rights as Canadians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7200366" data-originallang="en">Sadly, this is not just the walk; it is synagogues, schools and community centres. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7200367" data-originallang="en">We have a problem in this country, and members of this House need to know it.</p>
