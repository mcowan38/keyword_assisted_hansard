<p data-HoCid="7971451" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the Gaza Strip is currently being pounded by unprecedented air strikes: 400 yesterday alone. Nearly two-thirds of Gaza's hospitals are not functioning, with the remaining running out of power while needed fuel is blocked. In just two and a half weeks, almost 8,000 Israeli and Palestinian civilians have been killed, including more than 2,700 Palestinian kids. How many more children need to die before the government calls for a ceasefire?</p>
