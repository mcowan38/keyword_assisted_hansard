<p data-HoCid="7936238" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Chair, I would like to begin by acknowledging that we are on the traditional unceded territory of the Algonquin people who have lived on these lands for millennia. We recognize the enduring presence of first nations, Métis and Inuit peoples on this territory.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936239" data-originallang="en">It is with great humility that I rise to offer my candidacy as the Speaker of the House of Commons.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936240" data-originallang="en">I have been in the workforce for 34 years. One half of that time has been spent as a litigator. When I was called to the bar of Prince Edward Island in 1989, the presiding judge, Mr. Justice Gerard Mitchell as he then was, reminded me that as a member of the bar, I was an officer of the court and that my first duty was to the court. It was not to my clients, not to my firm, but to the court. Throughout my legal career, there were professional differences, robust debates and aggressive cross-examinations, but the respect for the administration of justice, the professional code of conduct and the rule of law transcended everything.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936241" data-originallang="en">I offer this comment not to say that we need more lawyers in this House, as for God's sake we have enough already, but to say that the level of respect for Parliament and the office of the Speaker has taken an incredible beating in this session of Parliament, especially in question period, and it does not need to. A vigorous and relentless prosecution of an issue is not made stronger by the repeated flouting of the rules of this place or by defying the Speaker. It denigrates this institution and all of us, its temporary occupants.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936242" data-originallang="en">I believe it is time for a reset, and the election of a Speaker in the middle of a parliamentary session is a historically unique opportunity to do just that. We can do better and we must. If individual members are willing to be part of a collective effort to restore public confidence in the way we treat each other and the rules of Parliament, then I would be honoured to lead that cause. If, on the other hand, members are comfortable with the current state of decorum and level of respect for the office of the Speaker, please do not vote for me.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936243" data-originallang="fr">I was first elected to Parliament in 2011 and proudly took my seat as an MP for the third party. We were in the Centre Block at the time. I spent four years as a member of the third party, then four years as parliamentary secretary to three different ministers, and the last four years as chair of standing committees. This variety of experience informs my perspective and approach to everything I do and makes it less difficult for me to put myself in the position of the MPs I am talking to. I submit this experience to the House.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936244" data-originallang="en">The events of September 22 were unfortunate, embarrassing and hurtful. A good man, with a deep respect for all of us and for this place, acknowledged his mistake and gave up a role that he took extremely seriously as a servant of the House.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936245" data-originallang="en">I would like to take this opportunity to thank the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278667" href="/politicians/anthony-rota/" title="Anthony Rota">Nipissing—Timiskaming</a> for his service and to welcome him back to caucus.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936246" data-originallang="fr">It will now be up to the next Speaker to make sure that this never happens again and that the proper procedures and protocols are adhered to. It will also be important that the new Speaker reach out to the communities that were hurt, including Jewish Canadians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936247" data-originallang="fr">I am ready to accept members' advice on how to lead this outreach.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936248" data-originallang="en">I want to thank my wife Deirdre and my family for their unwavering support in this pursuit.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936249" data-originallang="en">I am immensely grateful to the voters of Charlottetown, who have sent me back to Parliament four times to be their voice. Quite frankly, after all the good wishes I received in the riding on the weekend, I really wish they were eligible to vote.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936250" data-originallang="en">I will bring a breadth of experience, tough love, progressive discipline and a quick wit to the role of Speaker. If hon. members share my view that these are the key ingredients for Parliament at this point in our history, then I humbly ask for their support.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936251" data-originallang="en">If I may, tomorrow is my mom's birthday and I know she is watching. Happy birthday to her.</p>
