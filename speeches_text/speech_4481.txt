<p data-HoCid="8454308" data-originallang="en">I have a question around the fee that people have to pay for processing. If people are in a situation like what Sudanese and Gazans find themselves in, is there a possibility of waiving the fee? Right now, I think an adult pays about $635 and children cost $175. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8454309" data-originallang="en">This fee has been waived for Ukrainians. Is it possible for us to waive it for Sudanese community members and Gazans as well? They're also fleeing a very tough situation.</p>
