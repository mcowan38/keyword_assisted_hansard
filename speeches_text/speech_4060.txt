<p data-HoCid="8396434" data-originallang="fr"> Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8396435" data-originallang="fr">Minister Hussen, thank you for joining us today. This is your first appearance in front of this committee since your appointment last summer. As a former member of the National Assembly, in both the opposition and government, I'm always surprised by how rarely ministers get involved in parliamentary committee business on the Hill in Ottawa. In any case, we're delighted that you're finally here today to discuss the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development's estimates and appropriations for development assistance. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8396436" data-originallang="fr">The Bloc Québécois strongly disagreed with the Canadian government's decision to suspend funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, or UNRWA. We were greatly relieved by the decision to reinstate it. We felt that this was the right thing to do, given that Gaza is experiencing one of the worst humanitarian crises in decades and that this wasn't the right time to suspend Canadian aid. In addition, according to a United Nations press release, Israel has yet to provide any evidence to support its allegations that a significant number of UNRWA employees are members of terrorist organizations. It was appropriate to restore funding to this organization, which is likely in the best position to provide effective assistance to Palestinians struggling with the ongoing aggression in their territory.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8396437" data-originallang="fr">To even suggest that funding for UNRWA wouldn't be approved seems incredibly insensitive, given the current situation in Gaza.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8396438" data-originallang="fr">On that note, and given your observations and your rather worrying description of humanitarian aid in Gaza, what can be done to ensure that the aid reaches its destination in order to avoid the famine predicted by the United Nations?</p>
