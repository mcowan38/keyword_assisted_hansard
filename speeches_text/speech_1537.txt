<p data-HoCid="7095131" data-originallang="en"> As Ms. Gazan said, it's now been three years since the release of the national inquiry's final report. It's going to be a year since the release of the national action plan.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7095132" data-originallang="en">At the AFN, as the deputy grand chief spoke of, we have been reaching out in the regions and meeting with families and survivors. It was very important for the women's council to do that. We hear from them that they don't see the changes on the ground. They don't see the additional safe spaces in their communities. We know that in certain areas, especially in remote or rural areas, it is very difficult for indigenous women to find safe spaces for themselves and their families. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7095133" data-originallang="en">We see the commitments, but we just don't see the change on the ground. The advocacy of the AFN women's council certainly is that the implementation has to move faster and it has to be done collaboratively with families and survivors.</p>
