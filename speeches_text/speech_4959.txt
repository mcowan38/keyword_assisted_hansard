<p data-HoCid="8618642" data-originallang="en">Thanks very much, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8618643" data-originallang="en">I do understand that there are still a number of witnesses who we have yet to hear from with respect to this. I also understand that the RCMP has been very clear that they don't want committees like this to interfere with their ongoing investigations. They don't need the butting in on the important work they do.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8618644" data-originallang="en">Quite frankly, what happens after we hear from X, Y and Z witnesses here in the committee? What are we going to do with that information? It's tainted. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8618645" data-originallang="en">I've seen how Conservatives treat witnesses at this committee. I've seen just how much of a horrible time witnesses get put through when they come before this committee. I've seen businesses go through the ringer when Conservatives—whether it's this committee or any other committee—go through and interrogate them as though they were in a courtroom. This is not a courtroom. This is a place where we make policy decisions and where we provide recommendations to the Government of Canada as to how we are going to conduct our business going forward and how we can improve the business that we conduct.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8618646" data-originallang="en">We have all of these witnesses on the list who are going to be invited to this committee. I'm not sure why we need to suffer motion after motion that has literally zero impact on what we're trying to achieve here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8618647" data-originallang="en">What we're trying to achieve here, Chair—I'll remind you and our committee members, all of us—is to find a better process for ensuring that the clean-tech sector can have the support that it needs to support Canada's economy and grow Canada's economy, and for that to happen in a transparent and an accountable fashion, taking into account what Canadian taxpayer dollars are actually paying for.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8618648" data-originallang="en">There has been wrongdoing. I don't think any of us on this committee disagree with that. There has been wrongdoing, but what are we going to do about it? Are we going to go down the rabbit hole? Are we going to try to hold a kangaroo court here in this committee, or are we actually going to find some reasonable, sustainable, concrete solutions that are going to help in fixing the problem?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8618649" data-originallang="en">I think we can be those people who are going to fix the problem rather than going down whatever avenue, whatever court, the Conservatives want us to go down.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8618650" data-originallang="en">Mr. Perkins spoke about his leader and how he's really into this issue. Well—and Mr. Perkins did allude to this—do you know what's another issue? It's foreign interference.</p>
