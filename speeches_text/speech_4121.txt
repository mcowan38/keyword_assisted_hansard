<p data-HoCid="8405771" data-originallang="fr"> We'll start the meeting.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405772" data-originallang="fr">Welcome, everyone.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405773" data-originallang="en"> I call the meeting to order.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405774" data-originallang="en">Welcome to meeting number 104 of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405775" data-originallang="en">Pursuant to Standing Order 108(2) and the motion adopted by the committee on March 21, 2024, the committee is commencing its study on anti-Semitism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405776" data-originallang="en">I have a few things to read before we start.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405777" data-originallang="en">The first is on audio feedback. I want to remind all members and other participants in the room of the following important preventative measures.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405778" data-originallang="en">To prevent disruptive and potentially harmful audio feedback incidents, which can cause injuries, all in-person participants are reminded to keep their earpieces away from all microphones at all times. As indicated in the communiqué from the <a data-HoCid="300999" href="/politicians/greg-fergus/" title="Greg Fergus">Speaker</a> to members on Monday, April 29, the following measures have been taken to help prevent audio feedback incidents.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405779" data-originallang="en">All earpieces have been replaced by a model that greatly reduces the probability of audio feedback. The new earpieces are black in colour, whereas the former earpieces were grey. Please use only a black, approved earpiece. By default, all unused earpieces will be unplugged at the start of the meeting. When you're not using your earpiece, please place it face-down in the middle of the sticker that you will find on your table.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405780" data-originallang="en"> Please consult the cards on the table for guidelines to prevent audio feedback incidents.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405781" data-originallang="en"> The room layout has been adjusted as much as possible, especially for this morning, to increase the distance between microphones and reduce the chance of feedback from an ambient earpiece.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405782" data-originallang="en">These measures are in place so that we can conduct our business without interruption, and to protect the health and safety of all participants, including the interpreters.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405783" data-originallang="en">Thank you for your co-operation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405784" data-originallang="en">For those who don't need the earpiece, again, do not plug it in. That way, it won't cause any feedback for the interpreters.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405785" data-originallang="en">Today's meeting is taking place in a hybrid format. I note that all witnesses are appearing in person. Members' connections were completed in advance of the meeting.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405786" data-originallang="en">Please wait until I recognize you by name before speaking.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405787" data-originallang="en"> This is a reminder that all comments should be addressed through the chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405788" data-originallang="en">For the benefit of all those attending and viewing the webcast, I will remind you that all briefs can be sent to the committee until May 27, 2024, and they should not exceed three pages in total.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405789" data-originallang="en">For the benefit of the witnesses, I want you to know that this is how all meetings are conducted. It is nothing personal, but I will let you know right now that we've actually prepared these cards, which I will raise when you have 30 seconds left. I know that when somebody is doing their business, it's hard to look up, but I will keep raising it, and then when the time is up, I'll just raise the “time is up” card and give you a few seconds to wrap up if you haven't already wrapped up. Out of fairness, I will do that for everyone.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405790" data-originallang="en">All members know this—there are a number who have been on this committee for quite a while, and we have a number who are new—but I will just remind everybody that it's important that we all be compassionate in our conversations and respectful to each other and to the witnesses. I expect that to continue this morning. Thank you very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405791" data-originallang="en">Now I want to welcome the witnesses for today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405792" data-originallang="en">As individuals, we have students Rachel Cook, Michael Eshayek and Nicole Nashen; attorney Neil G. Oberman; Nati Pressmann, founder of the Canadian Union of Jewish Students; and Yos Tarshish for Hillel Ontario.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405793" data-originallang="en"> You each have up to five minutes for your opening remarks, after which we will proceed with the rounds of questions. Again, if your comments are six, seven or eight minutes long, don't worry. You will probably get an opportunity to go back to them during the questions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405794" data-originallang="en">Just as a reminder, I will say now that if there's anything you want to bring up that you do not have an opportunity to do during the meeting, whether in your opening remarks or during questioning, please feel free to submit it to us in writing, as long as it does not exceed three pages.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405795" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405796" data-originallang="en">With that, we will start with five minutes each. I will call on you as I have you here on the paper in front of me.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405797" data-originallang="en"> We'll start with Rachel Cook, please, for five minutes.</p>
