<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">I know that so far the debate has been somewhat muddying the waters around jurisdictional questions. I think we all understand that provinces have their own jurisdictions and that the federal government has its jurisdiction, but really what the motion is about is that Canadians, as a whole, including Québécois, want to get their lives back.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Would the member agree that the main thing that provinces and the federal government can do to get life back to normal is to get vaccines into the arms of its citizens?</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">I just pulled up a list. Canada ranks behind France, Germany, Poland, Italy, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, the UAE and, of course, Israel in getting its population vaccinated. </p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Would the member agree— </p>
