<p data-HoCid="8391419" data-originallang="en">As I was saying before I was interrupted, it's really important to me and the constituency that I represent that they—the members of my constituency, the residents in my community—know and understand that their member of Parliament stands up against hate and anti-Semitism in all of its forms, and that I am committed to working with all parliamentarians regardless of their political stripe. I'm sorry that saying that working with other parliamentarians may cause others some harm, but I think it's important for us to do that, to work with other parliamentarians across political lines to fight anti-Semitism. </p>
