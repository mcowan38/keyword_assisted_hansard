<p data-HoCid="6756227" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, I agree with my colleague. Yes, it is one thing to say we favour the two-state solution, but we must proactively try to help in that direction. This morning, I spoke with the foreign minister of Egypt and the foreign minister of Jordan. I have spoken to the foreign minister of the United States. I have spoken to the foreign minister of Israel as well as the foreign minister for the Palestinian authority in Canada, who has said it is hoping to be able to help toward a long-term solution, the two-state solution. </p>
