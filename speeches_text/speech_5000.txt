<p data-HoCid="8628403" data-originallang="en"> With all due respect, the actual substance of the anti-racism strategy does not actually call out anti-Palestinian racism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8628404" data-originallang="en">I want to go back to that question of consultation and definition.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8628405" data-originallang="en">Given the fact that you refuse to define anti-Palestinian racism, I thought it would be appropriate to read into the record the definition provided by the Arab Canadian Lawyers Association.</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8628406" data-originallang="en"> Anti-Palestinian racism takes various forms including: denying the Nakba and justifying violence against Palestinians; failing to acknowledge Palestinians as an Indigenous people with a collective identity, belonging and rights in relation to occupied and historic Palestine; erasing the human rights and equal dignity and worth of Palestinians; excluding or pressuring others to exclude Palestinian perspectives, Palestinians and their allies; defaming Palestinians and their allies with slander such as being inherently antisemitic, a terrorist threat/sympathizer or opposed to democratic values. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8628407" data-originallang="en">Why do you take issue with the Arab Canadian Lawyers Association's definition of anti-Palestinian racism? Why wasn't their voice and their work—which is cutting edge on this front—included as part of your anti-racism strategy?</p>
