<p data-HoCid="7489791" data-originallang="en">Thank you for that question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7489792" data-originallang="en">I know Ambassador O'Neill mentioned the “Voices at Risk” guidelines, which are meant to be implemented by Canadian missions all over the world. They have very clear recommendations around ambassadors requesting prison visits with human rights defenders and women's rights defenders who have been detained, asking the government to observe trials of human rights defenders, etc. Even when countries are unlikely to grant a Canadian ambassador that request, we should be making that request in order to signal our interest in human rights in the cases of specific human rights defenders.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7489793" data-originallang="en">What's missing here really is a sort of review of how actively our ambassadors are using those “Voices at Risk” guidelines. How actively are they using that specifically in countries with very strong bilateral trade relationships? I think of Egypt. I think of Israel. When was the last time these ambassadors requested to meet with a detained human rights defender, or to observe a trial? There is really a question here of implementation that's the problem.</p>
