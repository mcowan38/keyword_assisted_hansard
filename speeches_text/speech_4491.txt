<p data-HoCid="8456026" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much, Madam Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8456027" data-originallang="en">I'm going to address one other thing that's been bothering me in this session, and that is the emphasis on due process. I'm going to direct my question to Dr. Carr to start with. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8456028" data-originallang="en">When you say that there are processes under way, I have a certain amount of sympathy with that. Do your processes not require that those who are accused of anti-Semitism, harassment or other offences cease the behaviour while those processes are taking place? In other words, if we were talking in a public context, if someone continued the behaviour, that wouldn't be acceptable. They may not be found guilty of an offence yet, but they have to cease the behaviour while the process is going on. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8456029" data-originallang="en">Is there no way in any of your processes to require ceasing anti-Semitic, hateful and harassing behaviour?</p>
