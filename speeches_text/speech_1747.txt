<p data-HoCid="7200346" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, over the May long weekend, my community of Ottawa Centre and many others across eastern Ontario and western Quebec experienced one of the strongest storms in living memory. What started as an emergency alert Saturday afternoon ended in tragedy, devastation and darkness for thousands of residents. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7200347" data-originallang="fr">My heart breaks for those who lost loved ones during this awful storm. Unfortunately, such events are becoming all too normal. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7200348" data-originallang="en">In these trying circumstances, our community came together as it always does. Residents were out checking on their neighbours. Community organizations, such as the Soloway Jewish Community Centre, the Ottawa Mosque and the Parkdale Food Centre opened their doors to provide shelter, food and electricity to thousands, and our hydro workers and first responders took immediate action to repair the damage from this historic storm. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7200349" data-originallang="fr">We have not yet fully recovered, but residents across the City of Ottawa really rose to the challenge.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7200350" data-originallang="en">I thank our city workers, our volunteers and all our neighbours for their hard work.</p>
