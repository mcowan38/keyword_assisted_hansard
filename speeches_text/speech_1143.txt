<p data-HoCid="6791782" data-originallang="en">Unfortunately, at this time, with Hamas in a leadership role in Gaza and its absolute control in the planning and coordination of military activities there, life in Gaza for Palestinians is difficult and challenging. The military wing is really not distinct from the civilian leadership on the ground. From my understanding, women and LGBTQ and religious minorities face discrimination in treatment, as do political dissidents. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6791783" data-originallang="en">In light of that persecution and other things that we've heard on the ground there, dealing with humanitarian on the ground in Gaza is challenging. How would you respond to that?</p>
