<p data-HoCid="8068671" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, November 29 is International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian people. Given the recent conflict in the region, which has resulted in the deaths of over 14,000 innocent Palestinian civilians, including over 6,000 children, this yearâ€™s event is particularly poignant. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8068672" data-originallang="en">I continue to call for a permanent ceasefire, for a return of all hostages to their families and for badly needed humanitarian aid to reach all the people of Gaza. I pray that everyone can put their differences aside and work towards a just, equitable and peaceful two-state solution. Violence is never the answer. I yearn for the day when two peoples can live side by side in peace and prosperity. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8068673" data-originallang="en">Tonight, led by Palestinian, Arab and Muslim staffers, we will gather at the eternal flame on Parliament Hill in peace and solidarity with the Palestinian people. I hope all will join us.</p>
