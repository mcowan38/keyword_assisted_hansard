<p data-HoCid="8405956" data-originallang="en"> I would just like to say that the average Canadians who are on our campuses who are spewing hatred against Jews aren't necessarily supportive of the actions that the governments have to take, because they think they're not enough. The persons who are calling for an intifada until revolution still think our government is too pro-Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405957" data-originallang="en"> While we're talking about particular policy, I also want to keep in mind that's really the reality on our campuses, and I think we need to work towards talking about how we can actually deal with anti-Semitism on our campus. Regarding EDI, I think what we should do is try to incorporate more Jews into EDI because I think we deserve to be in those spaces, rather than get rid of them as a whole.</p>
