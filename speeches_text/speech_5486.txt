<p data-HoCid="8714948" data-originallang="en">Again, it has been asked that Canada step out in front of our closest allies, when I would make the claim that Canada's position and weight in the Middle East has diminished over time, even since the 1940s, for a whole host of other reasons. Would that increase the likelihood that our allies would see us in a positive vein in our stepping out and forward, or should more caution be exercised by our government, even though there's unanimity that the State of Palestine should be recognized at some point when it leads always to that lasting and durable peace?</p>
