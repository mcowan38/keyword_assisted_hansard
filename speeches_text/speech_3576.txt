<p data-HoCid="8266184" data-originallang="fr">Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8266185" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Sinclair, I want to make sure that you will actually end up answering our questions. We're still waiting for the answers from your colleagues who testified to inform us on the situation in Gaza, and I hope we'll be receiving your answers more quickly.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8266186" data-originallang="fr">When she appeared before the committee, the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="MÃ©lanie Joly">minister </a> said that the Government of Canada did not believe there should be restrictions on military exports between NATO allies. Personally, I found this statement rather odd, considering what happened in 2020. The minister added that she had had very firm and direct conversations with her Turkish counterpart about Armenia, in particular.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8266187" data-originallang="fr">Can you tell us what guarantees the minister has obtained from Turkey that the technology and equipment we would be sending to Turkey could not be used once again in a possible conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan?</p>
