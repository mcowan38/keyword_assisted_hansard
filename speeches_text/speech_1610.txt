<p data-HoCid="7113640" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the world has witnessed an abhorrent new low from Russia's foreign minister, whose ignorant comments about Adolf Hitler perpetuate a hateful and bigoted narrative to distract us from his war crimes. Russia has frequently invoked Nazism and World War II to justify its brazen aggression in Ukraine, while attacking Holocaust memorials as well as survivors of Russia's deliberate murder of civilians. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7113641" data-originallang="en">This is the lowest form of racism against Jews: to accuse Jews themselves of anti-Semitism. Lavrov's remarks are simply false and continue to contribute to the perpetuating discrimination and disinformation worldwide.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7113642" data-originallang="en"> It takes courage and more than just words when it comes to standing up for Jewish communities and their homeland. That position is non-negotiable, and I invite members of the House to say so. I will add my voice to the forceful condemnation and complete repudiation of these vile comments from Mr. Lavrov. They should also be called out in the House.</p>
