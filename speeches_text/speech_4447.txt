<p data-HoCid="8455867" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455868" data-originallang="en">President Carr, I want to ask you a question about your STRIVE task force that you referred to in your testimony.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455869" data-originallang="en">One of the three co-chairs you appointed to this task force has a long record of supporting BDS and opposing IHRA, which leaves a lack of confidence in the process amongst many of your Jewish students.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455870" data-originallang="en">Why did you appoint this person, and will you consider removing them as a co-chair?</p>
