<p data-HoCid="8454030" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8454031" data-originallang="en"> I will quote:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8454032" data-originallang="en"> There is no doubt that Canadian citizenship is highly valued and recognized around the world. We want...citizenship...to be fair, accessible, with clear and transparent rules. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8454033" data-originallang="en">Minister, for all we've seen in the immigration process programming announced to aid with the emergencies in Sudan and Gaza, it's safe to say that announcements made here in Canada by your government don't mesh with the operational realities that would enable migrants from these two conflict areas. Operationally, you don't have solutions, not for lack of trying, you say.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8454034" data-originallang="en"> We know that any government faces resource constraints and that you have to make choices, so the contrast of your inaction on these humanitarian files is stark compared to when you have chosen to take action. You personally, as minister, intervened with Canada Border Services Agency and chose to stay the deportation of Zain Haq. Minister, can you tell us why you dedicated your scarce resources to this intervention?</p>
