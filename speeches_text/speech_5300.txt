<p data-HoCid="8693783" data-originallang="fr">Why wait? What would be the logic behind that?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693784" data-originallang="fr">We really need to understand the situation we are facing right now. It's very difficult to find a Palestinian who wants a two-state solution. That said, a lot of Palestinians will accept it, although they may want something else.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693785" data-originallang="fr">I challenge you to find a Palestinian who thinks that Jaffa and Haifa are not part of Palestine. When I arrive at Ben Gurion airport, the poster in Hebrew and English welcomes me to Israel, but when my Palestinian friends see me there, they welcome me to Palestine. So in the hearts of all Palestinians, Jaffa, Beersheba and Haifa are still part of Palestine.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693786" data-originallang="fr">We have been saying for a long time that we are going to recognize the state of Palestine. In my opinion, the longer this drags on, the more frustrating it gets.</p>
