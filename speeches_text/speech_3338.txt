<p data-HoCid="8123349" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I rise to voice the concerns of constituents of Halifax West who have written to me about the heartbreaking humanitarian situation in the Middle East. Some of them have close family members, like parents, brothers, sisters and grandparents, who are trapped in Gaza.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8123350" data-originallang="en">I have spoken about this with the <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">Minister of Immigration</a>, and I want to echo the voices of my constituents who say that we should expand the definition of immediate family in IRPA to give them eligibility for emergency evacuation so that family members with close ties to Canadian citizens can get out safely. Many of them are highly educated, financially independent and blessed to have familial support here, and to welcome them would be entirely consistent with our commitment to humanitarianism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8123351" data-originallang="en">This is the holiday season, a time we share with the families we love. I want to wish everyone here, in Halifax West, in Canada and in the entire world peace and love.</p>
