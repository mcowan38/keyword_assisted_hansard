<p data-HoCid="6485271" data-originallang="en">Thank you so much, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6485272" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Chan, Mr. Dinsdale and Ms. Curran, thank you so much for joining us.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6485273" data-originallang="en">I want to delve a little further into something that my colleagues have addressed today. On a day where we commemorate six lives lost in a Quebec City mosque, in a week where through International Holocaust Remembrance Day we observe the lives lost, and a year where we have seen anti-Black racism at the fore, I want to ask a bit more about hate speech and understand how Facebook delineates between hate speech and freedom of speech.</p>
