<p data-HoCid="7076292" data-originallang="en">Thank you for your question. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7076293" data-originallang="en">My comment was really on how we can treat the proliferation of these views in a public context, such as for teachers to deal with trying to prevent a student from becoming radicalized. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7076294" data-originallang="en">Very recently, there were some instructions or a training course for teachers to identify students who might be becoming radicalized and on how to deal with that. I think it was funded or supported by the ministry of public safety. There was a whole discourse how on teachers should just be teachers. Teachers are not spies. Teachers are not police. Of course there are duties to report if a teacher comes across information that is of a serious nature. Just like doctors and other professionals have a duty to report, in this case they would have to do the same thing. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7076295" data-originallang="en">The message I gave to the teachers was that a student is greatly influenced by their teachers, especially depending on what period of development they're in, as children or teenagers or so on. They can bring to bear their expertise as teachers or as pastors or whatever their particular context is in which they engage with these individuals. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7076296" data-originallang="en">My statement was about making people understand that these supremacist, absolutist views that people take are unsustainable and impractical for life in Canada. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7076297" data-originallang="en">As for those people who have grown up in the west and went over there, at the end of the day we will not be able to prevent all radicalization. A certain amount of people will just go down that radicalization rabbit hole. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7076298" data-originallang="en">Unfortunately, at some point it's past the prevention stage and will fall into the intervention stage. That's really where the authorities will have to bring to bear their capabilities. </p>
