<p data-HoCid="7358914" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I completely agree with my colleague. Before preparing this speech, a book that I used to make my students read came to mind. Entitled <em>If This Is a Man</em>, by Primo Levi, the book is about the Holocaust. Everyone who reads this short book by Primo Levi thinks to themselves, “never again”. What we read about in <em>If This Is a Man</em> by Primo Levi should never happen again.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7358915" data-originallang="fr">Still, it seems to me that we have stooped to accepting what the Uighurs are currently experiencing. I do not understand why there is not more indignation about such miserable and violent living conditions that deprive these people of all their dignity. I believe that we need to collectively examine our priorities. Economic considerations ought not come before the dignity of people, no matter their religion or ethnicity.</p>
