<p data-HoCid="6702622" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, violence in East Jerusalem is deeply disturbing. Demolitions, forcibly removing Palestinians from their homes and blocking access to important gathering spots are all violations of human rights and international laws.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6702623" data-originallang="en">Instead of taking action to stop or deal with the long-standing illegal occupation, the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> is effectively supporting the status quo and going as far as to sell weapons to Israel. Arming one side of the conflict is undermining the peace process and supporting illegal occupation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6702624" data-originallang="en">Will the Prime Minister commit to stopping the sale of arms to Israel while it is violating international human rights?</p>
