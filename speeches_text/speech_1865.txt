<p data-HoCid="7345520" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Minister, for being here today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345521" data-originallang="en">I was a little concerned about your initial comments where you talked about anti-Semitism remaining a reality. I believe you are minimizing this. The police reported hate crime latest statistics actually show a significant rise in anti-Semitism, hate-motivated crimes. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7345522" data-originallang="en">What we're dealing with is not something that remains a reality. What we're dealing with is something that is becoming a greater and greater threat to our society. Anti-Semitism and anti-Semitism hate crimes are growing in this country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345523" data-originallang="en">In that context, I want to come back to the comments you made initially that you believed that an adequate vetting had taken place when you became the minister. Did that adequate vetting take into consideration social media accounts that date back to 2017, which clearly show a pattern of anti-Semitic slogans and comments on social media by Mr. Marouf? </p>
