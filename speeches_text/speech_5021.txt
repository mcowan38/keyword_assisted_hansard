<p data-HoCid="8595147" data-originallang="en">The Chair has been informed that the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> intends to move a motion. The Chair wishes to make a statement concerning the admissibility of the routine motion standing on the Order Paper in the name of the member for Winnipeg Centre, which aims to modify the Debates of June 4, more precisely to replace part of an intervention made by the member for <a data-HoCid="278683" href="/politicians/brad-redekopp/" title="Brad Redekopp">Saskatoon West</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8595148" data-originallang="fr"> First, let me commend the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> for a novel use of the motion. There may be circumstances under which a motion regarding the correctness of our records would be admissible.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8595149" data-originallang="en"> Members will, however, recall that the Chair was seized on June 6 with a similar request submitted through a question of privilege, which was also raised by the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>. The Chair determined on June 17 that the edited text of the debates, as published, was coherent with the interventions made that day. The Chair therefore considered the matter closed. I believe this is still the case.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8595150" data-originallang="fr">To permit this new motion to proceed at this time would be akin to an appeal of the Speaker's decision, which is prohibited pursuant to Standing Order 10. Consequently, the Chair must rule the motion out of order and direct that it be dropped from the Order Paper.</p>
<p class="procedural" data-HoCid="9">(Motion withdrawn)</p>
