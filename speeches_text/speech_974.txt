<p data-HoCid="6719205" data-originallang="en">We'll go now to Dr. Shalmon, the director of the international relations division at the Ministry of Health of Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6719206" data-originallang="en">Dr. Shalmon, welcome. You didn't have a chance to test your sound, so maybe you could say a few words to make sure the interpreters can hear you properly, and then we will carry on with your statement.</p>
