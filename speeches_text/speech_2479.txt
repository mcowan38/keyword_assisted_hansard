<p data-HoCid="7870212" data-originallang="en">CPC-35 will be distributed. There is also a CPC-36 and a CPC-37.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7870213" data-originallang="en">I move that Bill S-245 be amended by adding after line 18 on page 1 the following new clause: </p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7870214" data-originallang="en"> 1.4 Section 24 of the Act is amended by adding the following: </p>
<p data-HoCid="7870215" data-originallang="en"> Respecting holidays and days of significance to promote Canadaâ€™s multicultural identity </p>
<p data-HoCid="7870216" data-originallang="en"> 24.1 (21) Citizenship ceremonies may not be scheduled on Rosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year). </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7870217" data-originallang="en">Rosh Hashanah, as I said, is the Jewish new year according to the Jewish calendar. It does move around during the year. It's considered one of the high holy days. There's a focus on renewal and wishing for a prosperous new year. Traditions include hearing the blowing of the shofar. For those who don't know, the shofar is a ram's horn that is pierced through, so it has a deep, long bellowing sound. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7870218" data-originallang="en">They feast together. The eating of sweet foods and the dipping of apples in honey are part of the tradition. Orthodox Jews refrain from using electricity, driving, riding and other forms of prohibited work. Many of these are Talmudic laws as well. I think it's important that we not hold citizenship ceremonies on those days.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7870219" data-originallang="en">There was an election at one point scheduled around Rosh Hashanah, and it resulted in some areas of the country having a difficult time finding election workers. Equally, in this situation, I think it would be best to have citizenship ceremonies avoid this day so that persons of the Jewish faith can celebrate Rosh Hashanah with their families.</p>
