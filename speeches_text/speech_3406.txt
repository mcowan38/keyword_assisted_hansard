<p data-HoCid="8169905" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, it has been 116 days since the October 7 attacks: 116 days of hostilities, violence and an ever-escalating humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8169906" data-originallang="en">I continue to be in full support of a complete and sustainable ceasefire. Hamas must surrender and must release all hostages. More humanitarian aid must reach civilians, and innocent people must be protected, particularly children, who have suffered the worst consequences of this war.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8169907" data-originallang="en">I am grateful for our government's decision to increase the humanitarian assistance being provided to Gaza, now over $100 million, with Canada providing an additional $40 million in humanitarian aid and support to address the urgent needs of the Gaza Strip. We also have an obligation to ensure that Canadians can reunite with family members in the Middle East. In the case of journalist Mansour Shouman, I hope for his safe return to his family in Canada as quickly as possible.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8169908" data-originallang="en">I am proud that the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> has pushed back against Netanyahu's reckless rejection of a two-state solution. Indeed, the only way forward for Palestinians and Israelis is to have an internationally recognized Palestinian state that is safe and secure with borders. We believe in a two-state solution. We believe that peace is possible.</p>
