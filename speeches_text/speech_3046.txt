<p data-HoCid="8038306" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8038307" data-originallang="en">I want to join others in saluting the heroism and resilience of our witnesses. Of course, for all of us, these stories make us think of our own families and children and how horrible it must be to be in these situations. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8038308" data-originallang="en">I also think of my grandmother, who was a Holocaust survivor. She spent part of the war separated from her family, in hiding. The promise we made at the end of that war to her generation was “never again”. We have failed to deliver on that promise, as we are again hearing testimony of what is clearly a genocide planned in and perpetrated from the highest levels of the Putin regime. Vladimir Putin himself is directly involved in this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8038309" data-originallang="en">I want to focus my question on hearing more first-person testimony, but I want to invite the NGO representatives to respond in writing to this initial question: Which further individuals should be sanctioned for their involvement in these crimes? Which further international legal processes do you think should be convened, and against which individuals? </p>
<p data-HoCid="8038310" data-originallang="en">These are concrete proposals our committee can make, so I'd appreciate your following up in writing on those points.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8038311" data-originallang="en">I'd like to ask the young people here to specifically share any efforts those who were controlling you used to force you into propaganda activities. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8038312" data-originallang="en">Were you forced to do certain things that you understood would be used as Russian propaganda? Were you filmed? Would other children sometimes try to not participate in those activities? What would happen to them if they refused to participate in those activities?</p>
