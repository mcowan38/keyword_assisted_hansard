<p data-HoCid="7322234" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair, and welcome to Ottawa. It's a good place to be.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7322235" data-originallang="en">I wish to speak to the motion with regard to bringing <a data-HoCid="278929" href="/politicians/pablo-rodriguez/" title="Pablo Rodriguez">Minister Rodriguez</a> forward on the hiring of an individual who has now been identified as an anti-Semite. This individual was hired by Canadian Heritage in order to provide anti-racism training specifically to the media.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7322236" data-originallang="en"> This individual has made numerous posts on social media with regard to Jews and his belief in terms of their value and how they should be treated within Canadian society—and I daresay worldwide. His comments have been grotesque and altogether inappropriate. This individual was hired, contracted and given public funding through multiple avenues in order to pull off this training. It's hard to believe this individual would have gotten through any sort of vetting process, assuming there was one when this hiring decision was made.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7322237" data-originallang="en">As the <a data-HoCid="278929" href="/politicians/pablo-rodriguez/" title="Pablo Rodriguez">minister</a> of the heritage department, it is up to Minister Rodriguez to answer for that. I understand <a data-HoCid="278914" href="/politicians/ahmed-hussen/" title="Ahmed Hussen">Minister Hussen</a> also had something to do with this, in terms of his responsibilities, but, ultimately, it is the head of the department—the minister—who oversees the entire thing. It is his responsibility to answer for this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7322238" data-originallang="en">Furthermore, it is my understanding that funding came through the CRTC, which the <a data-HoCid="278929" href="/politicians/pablo-rodriguez/" title="Pablo Rodriguez">heritage minister</a> directly oversees. It's not up to <a data-HoCid="278914" href="/politicians/ahmed-hussen/" title="Ahmed Hussen">Minister Hussen</a> to answer for that funding. It is up to the heritage minister, Minister Rodriguez, to answer for that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7322239" data-originallang="en">For the reasons I have outlined, I believe it would be appropriate and in the best interest of the Canadian public to hear from the <a data-HoCid="278929" href="/politicians/pablo-rodriguez/" title="Pablo Rodriguez">Minister of Heritage</a> himself, rather than simply <a data-HoCid="278914" href="/politicians/ahmed-hussen/" title="Ahmed Hussen">Minister Hussen</a>. For that reason, I believe the motion my colleague Mr. Waugh brought before the committee today carries great weight and should be given due consideration.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7322240" data-originallang="en"> I would reiterate that this ultimately comes down to Canadians. Of course, if you simply google it, you will see that there was outrage when Canadians found out, this summer, that money was handed off to this individual, Mr. Marouf, to conduct this training.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7322241" data-originallang="en">Unfortunately, the vast majority of Liberal members were silent. I credit Mr. Housefather for speaking out, having a voice on this issue and advocating for justice. I value his voice and his take. I'm particularly disappointed with the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, <a data-HoCid="278914" href="/politicians/ahmed-hussen/" title="Ahmed Hussen">Minister Hussen</a> and, ultimately, <a data-HoCid="278929" href="/politicians/pablo-rodriguez/" title="Pablo Rodriguez">Minister Rodriguez</a>, who took more than two weeks to finally offer a comment with regard to this incident. I thought that was altogether inappropriate. More importantly, it's not just me who thought this. Canadians from coast to coast felt that it was super inappropriate and that this government needed to take action far sooner than it did.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7322242" data-originallang="en">Given the mistakes made and their grave impact on a significant portion of the Canadian population.... No, all Canadians were impacted by this, because we should all be held to a high standard in terms of the way we treat one another. That standard should be modelled for us by the government and by anyone the government contracts. All Canadians were done a disservice by this individual being hired. However, one group in particular was at the point of the sword, and that was the Jewish community in Canada. They should never have been put through that—never. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7322243" data-originallang="en">There is only one individual responsible for answering for this decision, and that is <a data-HoCid="278929" href="/politicians/pablo-rodriguez/" title="Pablo Rodriguez">Minister Rodriguez</a>. My fellow colleagues from the Liberal side have a choice to make—they can allow this incident to be answered for. They can bring greater clarity to it through the Minister of Heritage, or they can cover for this mistake and not allow light to be shed on it. If so, they're actually—I would argue—participating in the unfortunate incident that took place this summer, because then there's no accountability.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7322244" data-originallang="en"> There's actually a shielding of the minister. I do believe that, again, it's in the best interests of Canadians to have him come, and to be able to ask him the questions that Canadians would like answered.</p>
