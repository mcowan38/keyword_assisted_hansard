<p data-HoCid="7265044" data-originallang="en">I'm going to move to Ms. Bhandari, if I may.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7265045" data-originallang="en">I'd like to touch on something that, unfortunately, we didn't get to enough in this study, which is location tracking technologies used in commercial and retail spaces. For example, Cadillac Fairview is a big mall owner here in Canada. They tend to have cameras and other technologies in their spaces, from what I understand.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7265046" data-originallang="en">We talk a lot about the legislation in terms of the relationship of private companies with law enforcement. I'll start with you, Ms. Bhandari, and perhaps also Mr. Israel. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7265047" data-originallang="en">What are your thoughts on how we legislate that private or commercial relationship with these types of technologies going forward, in an ideal world, if there was a moratorium and we had time to think about this?</p>
