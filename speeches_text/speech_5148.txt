<p data-HoCid="8679358" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679359" data-originallang="fr">I would like to welcome all of our witnesses and thank them for taking part in this important study.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679360" data-originallang="fr">I don't think there's any dissent in this committee or in the government about the importance of having a Palestinian state and an Israeli state side by side to bring about lasting peace. I think everyone recognizes that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679361" data-originallang="fr">In fact, today, with the first panel of witnesses, we talked a lot about the negotiation process for the Oslo accords. We also talked about the conditions needed to bring the parties back to the bargaining table in very challenging circumstances where both populations are traumatized, as we've heard. It's very challenging.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679362" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Imseis, how could Canada play its role in bringing the parties back to the negotiating table so that discussions towards a lasting peace and a two-state solution can continue to move forward?</p>
