<p data-HoCid="7150437" data-originallang="en">We certainly welcome any investment that promotes Holocaust remembrance, but we would also very much like to see an improvement in school curriculum, particularly at the high school level. As well, we would like to see the broadening of the mandate of the special envoy preserving Holocaust remembrance and combatting anti-Semitism. The Honourable Irwin Cotler was just recently named, and the mandate includes preserving the Holocaust.</p>
