<p data-HoCid="7956558" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the tragic loss of life at the hands of Hamas's evil has made us angry, sad and filled with unimaginable grief as we are left trying to comprehend the incomprehensible.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7956559" data-originallang="en">These terror attacks are the cruellest against the Jewish people, my people, since the Holocaust.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7956560" data-originallang="en">It is possible to live in a world where we strive for peace in the Middle East while at the same time being able to state in no uncertain terms that we condemn the rape, murder and kidnapping of innocent women, children and the elderly. We must be able to say this without the word “but” inserted to serve as the catalyst for some moral justification. There is no morality to be found in what it has done.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7956561" data-originallang="en">Even the lives of people whose interests Hamas claims to represent mean nothing in its pursuit of hatred and the eradication of the Jewish people. There is no question that we must uphold the value of all human life and extend to one another a sense of kindness and dignity as we struggle together in the days ahead.</p>
