<p data-HoCid="8589427" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8589428" data-originallang="fr">Members of the committee, thank you for giving me another opportunity to share my observations and concerns about the future of our nation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8589429" data-originallang="en">I was asked to comment on the question of privilege related to the cyber-attack targeting members of Parliament. In short, expect a sharp increase of cyber-attacks in the next years targeting not only members of Parliament but many elected officials of all government levels: federal, provincial and municipal.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8589430" data-originallang="en">Cyber-attacks have been and will remain the weapon of choice for many threat agents. This implies direct and substantive attacks against elected officials, institutions and our democratic systems. The intelligence community identifies basically five threat agents: state-sponsored attacks, radicalized citizens, organized crime/hackers, political activists and insider threats.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8589431" data-originallang="en">In terms of state-sponsored threats, in the last two years, very dark revelations have come to be known publicly about how the current and previous governments have neglected or avoided—sometimes intentionally—acting against foreign interference threats. Since the cat is now out of the bag, foreign agents will be forced, for a while, to work a little bit more covertly, so cyber-attacks will be chosen. Today, we hope the public's and elected officials' awareness has been raised, but it's not enough, sadly. When it comes to cybersecurity, Canada is last in investment compared to others in the G7 and the Five Eyes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8589432" data-originallang="en">As the work of the committee demonstrates, you are still working on the issue, and many of you must feel like you are pounding your head against a wall. Unfortunately, petty political gains prevent Canadians from receiving the necessary protection. Not enough has been done on the legal side, like bringing modifications to the Criminal Code. A bad course of action has been selected, I must say, despite the fact that many experts advised going in different ways. From the public's perspective, this has only increased the bitterness and the loss of confidence in our institutions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8589433" data-originallang="fr">I repeat: We inevitably expect a sharp increase in cyber-attacks against elected officials in the coming years.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8589434" data-originallang="fr">Offensive powers such as China, India, Russia, Iran, Israel, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and many others will have to change and adapt their strategies. They will also have to reduce their presence on the ground, at least for a while, and be more subtle and sneaky.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8589435" data-originallang="en"> Thus, when launching more cyber-attacks against officials, various forms will be deployed: continuous negative and supportive campaigns against people opposed to them or in favour of them, hacking various systems to gain sensitive information, and neutralizing communications and compromising data by targeting specific individuals.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8589436" data-originallang="en"> The nature of the work of elected officials is to travel to meet their constituents and to sometimes work at home—everything needed to weaken our cybersecurity. Therefore, more discipline, more awareness, more verification, more ongoing education and more vigilance are needed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8589437" data-originallang="en"> You must have noticed that I've used the words “elected officials”. I stress that we need to work with the federal, provincial and municipal levels. Currently, cities like Toronto, Vancouver and Ottawa, and even smaller cities like Brossard, Markham and many others, are under the influence of agents of China, as we speak, at the highest level. This is not fiction; this is fact. Do you want names? I have names. National security without the participation of the provinces is just wishful thinking.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8589438" data-originallang="fr">The House of Commons Sergeant-at-Arms reports that there have been 800% more cyber-attacks against elected officials since 2018. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, or RCMP, has noted that since 2023, it has received 65 times more requests for protection and doesn't have enough staff to protect all members of the House of Commons. In Quebec, since the last municipal election, more than 10% of municipal elected officials, more than 800 people, have resigned because threats were made against them or their families. In the last provincial election in Quebec, they had to give candidates bulletproof vests and bodyguards.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8589439" data-originallang="en"> I will stop at this point, and I will be glad to take questions to develop a bit further the points that I have presented.</p>
