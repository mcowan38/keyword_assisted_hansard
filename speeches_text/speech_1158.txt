<p data-HoCid="6784306" data-originallang="en">Dr. Perry, at the end of your commentary, you talked about anti-Semitism as not quite an afterthought, but that it wasn't part of the mainstream of your concerns. However, we've met with members of the Jewish community who are very concerned about the rise in anti-Semitism over the past number of years, four or five at least, and they are concerned about their security and safety and with direct attacks and ongoing threats against them. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6784307" data-originallang="en">Is this something that you've noticed, or is it something that's separate from this far-right extremism? What can be done about that?</p>
