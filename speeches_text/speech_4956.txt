<p data-HoCid="8604955" data-originallang="en"> It is extremely important to B'nai Brith because we're now almost 100 years removed from the Holocaust. We have access to the first-hand testimony of survivors less and less each year. It's important that we are able to learn from our past as a nation, and that all Holocaust records are made available to the public so we can have clarity on Canada's role in the immigration of members of the Nazi Party and their affiliates to Canada. It's also so we can use those records to further advance our ability to teach the Holocaust and spread Holocaust education across the country.</p>
