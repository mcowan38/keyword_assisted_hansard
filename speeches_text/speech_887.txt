<p data-HoCid="6649070" data-originallang="en">In the meantime, for the benefit of the members, I just want to suggest that they pull out the agenda that was circulated by the clerk. The agenda has a very clear outline of what's being discussed today, corresponding to the package that was sent by the clerk last night or earlier this morning, with one addition that was sent by me this morning. </p>
