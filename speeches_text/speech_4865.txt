<p data-HoCid="8576378" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I want to know if the hon. member is clear on what she is actually being told to read in the House. What did she mean when she uttered talking points about Israel having a right to defend itself? Is it that Israel can intercept hundreds of ballistic missiles in a single day, and that is where it ends?</p>
