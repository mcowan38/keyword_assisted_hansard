<p data-HoCid="7379613" data-originallang="en">I was a little bit surprised too that I didn't get a little bit more government support. Some of the stuff now is almost like grabbing at clouds: What's wrong with the bill? I'm open to amendments. I'm open to changing it. I'd like to have everybody support this bill. I'm appreciative of and very grateful for the openness. I've tried to be transparent. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7379614" data-originallang="en">To be fair, the Bloc Québécois, the Conservatives and the Green Party had some concerns on things, and I had to work on getting those resolved. They were smaller things, but I was very happy to get that input. I'm looking for that input on the government side, because I would like more than two Liberals to vote for it. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7379615" data-originallang="en">It is a unique thing. My first Parliament here was in 2002, during a majority. I've been through Liberal majorities, Liberal minorities, Conservative majorities and Conservative minorities. Whatever you want to have here, life is short and time is short. That's why last time I worked with <a data-HoCid="278477" href="/politicians/kevin-waugh/" title="Kevin Waugh">Mr. Waugh</a> on a bill. I was really proud to do that, because it actually helped me to grow as a person. That's what I want to do here. I don't want to stop growing as a person at the table here. I'm trying to find solutions and get to that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7379616" data-originallang="en">If we don't take those opportunities, they get.... What I've learned about this place is that it can be a logic-free zone. It can be that way, and it takes everybody, including me, to keep it from being that way. Sometimes, and it's why we're here, we have to make some political decisions. I know that it can be convenient to basically not see this uniqueness the way I do, but that's my job. It's never been easy to get the border crossing done. It's never been easy to do some of the other work I've done. But my job as a representative for that area is to prove the case. We did this with the border. We were told that it was not necessary and not needed. We fought until we got it done and done right.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7379617" data-originallang="en"> I believe the same thing with this case. It's unique. It's on the border. It fits a lot of different things. I don't understand why we can't get it done.</p>
