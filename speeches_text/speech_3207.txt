<p data-HoCid="8124774" data-originallang="en">Certainly. Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8124775" data-originallang="en">May I begin by thanking you for the kind words? We will pass those on to our colleagues at the front lines, who have also been experiencing some trauma. These words are very much appreciated.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8124776" data-originallang="en">In terms of what Canada has done so far, the baseline development assistance provided to Palestinian populations in Gaza, the West Bank and adjoining regions is in the vicinity of $55 million per year. This is to assist with inclusive governance, gender equality, employment opportunities, etc.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8124777" data-originallang="en">Since the beginning of the crisis, as I said in my remarks, we've allocated, so far, $60 million to support humanitarian delivery and operations. This is done through partnership both with UN organizations and with civil society organizations on the ground. There's a lot of coordination that happens with other donor countries. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8124778" data-originallang="en">The important part is giving as much flexibility as possible to these organizations, because they know more than anyone where the greatest need is, and they can pre-position the aid.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8124779" data-originallang="en">One of the greatest obstacles has, of course, been the fact that there's been only one point of entry, the famous Rafah crossing, which traditionally was never designed for large amounts of commercial or humanitarian goods. It was a person crossing, if you will, with other points being used for commercial shipping and humanitarian assistance when needed. That's been a huge challenge because of the inspections needed of every truck going into Gaza. With international partners, what we're doing now is finding ways to accelerate it by maybe using other border crossings to help facilitate this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8124780" data-originallang="en">The pause was extremely helpful. It provided life-saving assistance. What we need to see is a sustained cadence to continue bringing in aid, particularly fuel, medicine and food.</p>
