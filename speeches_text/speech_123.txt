<p data-HoCid="6112263" data-originallang="en">We have been involved with UNRWA for a number of years. We've been trying to help vulnerable Palestinians who need assistance. We have refugees and we have been there to provide assistance, and we will continue to do so. We have been monitoring UNRWA very closely, however, because there have been some allegations. We're monitoring the assistance that's being provided, and we will continue to do so. UNRWA, for those watching at home, is the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which has been providing assistance to the Palestinian people.</p>
