<p data-HoCid="8124932" data-originallang="en">Has Canada made any formal complaint to the Government of Israel over the genocidal rhetoric that we've heard from right-wing ministers, such as the call for “a new Nakba”, the use of the term “human animals” by Israel's defence minister, calls to completely destroy Gaza and the heritage minister saying that Israel should drop an atomic bomb on Gazans?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8124933" data-originallang="en">What is Canada's comment on that language from the Israeli government?</p>
