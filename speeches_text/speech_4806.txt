<p data-HoCid="8586874" data-originallang="en">Furthering our brief recommendation, promoting a victim-centred approach relating to children means creating the social-legal environment wherein children can speak of the impact that non-state torturers' coercive control manipulations have on them, on other children and against animals. Their safety is always threatened, creating never-ending vulnerability as described in Bill <a data-HoCid="12433708" href="/bills/44-1/C-332/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (coercive control of intimate partner)">C-332</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8586875" data-originallang="en"> Our brief introduced Carrie, whose father forced her to drown her pet kitten and threatened to drown her if she told of his torture trafficking. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8586876" data-originallang="en">Carrie is not alone. Alex's father took her to see baby rabbits. Hugging one, her father then took the rabbit and broke its neck. His message was clear. Alex said she knew never to tell that he was torture trafficking her. Alex was six years old.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8586877" data-originallang="en"> The knowledge is that these perpetrators inflict coercive control within and outside of their home. Children's victimization can include the harming of animals. Non-state torturers' coercive control of their children includes intentionally inflicting no-win victimization ordeals in and out of their home. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8586878" data-originallang="en"> Hope described how her father used to blackmail her by forcing her to allow him to orally rape her so her siblings would be fed. She wondered what choice she had. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8586879" data-originallang="en"> Carrie described being forced to smear Margaret, another little girl, with perpetrators' body fluids so she would not have to consume their body fluids, saying that there was no way she could win. The decision left her feeling like she had harmed Margaret. She felt so guilty, ashamed, humiliated and terrified. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8586880" data-originallang="en"> To end the epidemic of intimate partner violence against women, red flag indicators will be preventive interventions available to children if the torturer's m.o. of coercive behaviours is understood as involving their exertion of absolute domination, power and control in and out of their home; inflicting torture, terror, horror and dehumanization on their children and other children; and the harming of animals. As well, it is the possible involvement of organized criminal torture, trafficking and formal networks.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8586881" data-originallang="en"> To Linda's recommendation I add support for Bill <a data-HoCid="12433708" href="/bills/44-1/C-332/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (coercive control of intimate partner)">C-332</a> and the criminalization of non-state torture to expose the perpetrators' criminality.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8586882" data-originallang="en"> Thank you.</p>
