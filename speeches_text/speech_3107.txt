<p data-HoCid="8087877" data-originallang="en"> Yes, indeed, with Japan as the host country for the G7 in 2023, they in fact hosted 16 ministerial conferences, as well as the leaders summit that took place in May. In terms of the foreign affairs ministers summit, there was one in April and there was a secondary one in November. At both of those meetings.... <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="MÃ©lanie Joly">Minister Joly</a>, of course, was present in Japan, and things changed between the April meeting and the November meeting in terms of global activities. The focus at the April meeting was to engage with G7 partners and talk about the situation in Ukraine. The focus of the November meeting was on the situation in Ukraine as well as the situation in Israel and the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8087878" data-originallang="en">With respect to APEC in San Francisco recently, I think there's no doubt that the event that took up all the oxygen in the room was the anticipation of the President Biden-President Xi summit, which, by all accounts, was a successful four-hour summit. I think it was important, not just to those two countries but also to Canada and all the other APEC nations, and perhaps nations around the world, that China and the United States essentially set a bit of a reset and took the temperature down a little bit on the frictions that had been happening between those two countries. That, in effect, lowers the temperature globally for many countries in their relationships with China. The decision by the two leaders to speak more frequently, to pick up the phone and speak virtually any time they wish, is something that hasn't happened for a while. I think Canada takes great comfort that this was achieved at the APEC summit in San Francisco.</p>
