<p data-HoCid="8735256" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I present a petition today signed primarily by Lebanese Canadian constituents in my riding of Scarborough Centre. They draw our attention to the conflict in the Middle East, which has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced many more in Palestine and in Lebanon. Petitioners note that Israeli air strikes have hit UNESCO world heritage sites and health care facilities, and they point to the death of over 170 health care workers.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8735257" data-originallang="en">Petitioners call on the Government of Canada to implement sanctions on the Netanyahu government, to ensure a clear and unambiguous two-way arms embargo, to support a United Nations resolution calling for our peacekeepers in Gaza as part of the development of mechanisms and to ensure civilian protection. They are calling for peace and for recognition of the state of Palestine.</p>
