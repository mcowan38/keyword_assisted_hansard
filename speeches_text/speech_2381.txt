<p data-HoCid="7805335" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Davidson. Those were great questions and responses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7805336" data-originallang="en">I was thinking of Peter Adams when you were talking. I was fortunate to meet him before he passed, up in Peterborough. I know he was one of the real instigators.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7805337" data-originallang="en">We need to continue with our meeting. I'll turn off my reflections.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7805338" data-originallang="en">We'll go over to Ms. Gazan. It's great to have you here. Thank you and welcome to our committee.</p>
