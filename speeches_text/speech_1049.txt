<p data-HoCid="6756229" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, I refer my colleague to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights statement we made last Thursday, where we have been very clear on our position with respect to trying to achieve a two-state solution and particularly with respect to the issue of settlements, which has been a very difficult one and which has essentially been a major stumbling block in finding a two-state solution. Canada is categorical in saying these settlements must cease immediately.</p>
