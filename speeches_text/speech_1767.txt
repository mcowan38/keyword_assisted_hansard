<p data-HoCid="7230294" data-originallang="en">On the procedural matter, if you look to the book, you have already made a ruling. You've determined that it was in fact in order. Debate commenced, and now a member is saying they don't understand the subamendment that was sent around by the clerk. </p>

That's my understanding of how the procedures are to work. I would welcome it if you were to consult with the clerk on this matter, if you choose to. </p>
