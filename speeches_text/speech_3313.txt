We saw last year that every single ideologically motivated mass killing in North America came from the far right. We saw a homophobic attack in Colorado Springs, racist attacks in Charleston and Buffalo, anti-Semitic attacks in Pittsburgh at the Tree of Life synagogue, Islamophobic attacks in Quebec City and London, and misogynistic attacks in Toronto. All of them were provoked by this extensive network of encouraging hate in all its toxic forms.</p>
