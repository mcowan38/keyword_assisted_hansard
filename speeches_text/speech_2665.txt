<p data-HoCid="7957791" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for sharing some very important personal reflections that I think are very valuable for the House to consider.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957792" data-originallang="en">I want to ask a question on a somewhat different aspect of this debate. It is a question I have asked a few government members. It is about the role of the Iranian regime in supporting Hamas and supporting other terrorist organizations that threaten Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957793" data-originallang="en">Up until now, it has not been the position of the government to list the IRGC as a terrorist organization. I know there are some members of the government who have individually expressed support for the idea of listing the IRGC as a terrorist organization. This is another example. We have seen many examples in recent years of IRGC violence.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957794" data-originallang="en">Does the member think there may possibly be a change coming in the government's position on listing the IRGC as a terrorist organization?</p>
