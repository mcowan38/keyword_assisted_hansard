<p data-HoCid="7761379" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7761380" data-originallang="en">Thank you to all of the witnesses. It's my privilege to sit here with you today. My colleague, MP <a data-HoCid="281018" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Leah Gazan</a>, wasn't able to attend. I do appreciate the testimony by all of the witnesses and the incredible work you're all doing to help make sure that women and girls are safe.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7761381" data-originallang="en">I will be directing all of my questions to Ms. Timea Nagy. I'm very impressed by your statements and the work you're doing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7761382" data-originallang="en">I understand your call for a national investment in national systemic changes and ensuring that we have better services for victims. I wonder if you could give a bit more information on what services should be available to survivors to support them in their reintegration process.</p>
