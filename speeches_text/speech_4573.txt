<p data-HoCid="8476626" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, while I am on my feet, I would also like to address the question of privilege raised by the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> regarding the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278683" href="/politicians/brad-redekopp/" title="Brad Redekopp">Saskatoon West</a>. First, I am pleased to hear that she accepted the apology of our colleague when he rose on Thursday morning to advise the House that he had misspoken one word. It is an age-old tradition in this place that we accept the word and the apologies of our colleagues. That said, it apparently did not draw a line under the matter, so we are left to address the question of privilege raised concerning the accuracy of the Debates. I will read from page 1229 of <em>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</em>, third edition:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8476627" data-originallang="en"> The availability of the blues on the House of Commonsâ€™ internal website permits Members and their authorized delegates to use the web page or email to submit suggested changes for Parliamentary Publications editorial staff to consider.... It is a long-standing practice of the House that editors of the Debates may exercise judgment as to whether or not changes suggested by Members constitute the correction of an error or a minor alteration. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8476628" data-originallang="en"> These practices were the subject of a very recently delivered ruling by the Speaker; on May 30, at page 24087 of the Debates, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8476629" data-originallang="en"> While the Debates are published under the authority of the Chair, the House should know that the Chair plays no part in editing the Debates. The editors of the Parliamentary Publications team craft a record that, in their judgment, best corresponds to the proceedings, without political interference and in a completely non-partisan manner. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8476630" data-originallang="en"> The editors may make changes to the records of the House proceedings, whether or not those changes are proposed by members, in accordance with their own guidelines and long-standing practices. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8476631" data-originallang="en"> If the Speaker himself plays no part in editing Hansard, then it must similarly follow that a private member on the opposition benches could claim no power or authority to override the editors' guidelines and long-standing practices. I would respectfully submit that, on that basis alone, the question of privilege must be dismissed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8476632" data-originallang="en">In any event, though, I would also refer the Chair to these comments, found on pages 1229 to 1230 of Bosc and Gagnon, where we read:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8476633" data-originallang="en"> Substantial errors in the Debates, as opposed to editorial changes, must be brought to the attention of the House by means of a point of order as soon as possible after the sitting, if a Member wishes to have the record changed.... When a question arises in the House as to the accuracy of the record, it is the responsibility of the Speaker to look into the matter. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8476634" data-originallang="en">In short, the correct procedure would have been for a point of order, not a question of privilege, to address a concern of this nature with Hansard. Therefore, the question of privilege must also fail on these grounds.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8476635" data-originallang="en">Nonetheless, I would underscore for the House that the member for <a data-HoCid="278683" href="/politicians/brad-redekopp/" title="Brad Redekopp">Saskatoon West</a> has done the honourable thing. He apologized and advised that he had misspoken one word, thereby properly correcting the record to reflect the intention of his remarks.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8476636" data-originallang="en">As such, Mr. Speaker, I would submit that you may now simply find the matter to be closed.</p>
