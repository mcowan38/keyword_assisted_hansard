<p data-HoCid="8434966" data-originallang="en"> I look forward to seeing that recommendation materialize in this committee's final report.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8434967" data-originallang="en">Second, I want to branch out on the need for greater training of law enforcement within this country when it comes to the prosecution of anti-Semitic hate speech, because the trends are deeply alarming. We've heard and seen demonstrators say things like, “All the Zionists are racists,” “All the Zionists are terrorists,” and, “Long live October 7,” which was the single worst day of casualties to the Jewish people since the Holocaust during the Second World War.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8434968" data-originallang="en"> The case of Adil Charkaoui is perhaps one of the most egregious offences that I have seen, certainly since October 7. In the aftermath of October 7, he took to the streets in Montreal, denounced Zionists and called for the enemies of Gaza to be killed. He said, “spare none of them.” As a former prosecutor, I found the decision not to pursue criminal charges incomprehensible and deeply problematic. Zionists are an identifiable group on racial, religious, national and/or ethnic grounds for the purposes of sections 318 and 319 of the Criminal Code.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8434969" data-originallang="en">My question is for anyone who wants to take it. I see Monsieur Marceau in the room. I know Ms. Kirzner-Roberts is also on the line.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8434970" data-originallang="en">Do we need greater training for law enforcement, including police and prosecutors, to help them understand what anti-Semitic hate speech is and to ensure that, in the application of our existing laws, we are keeping our communities safe?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8434971" data-originallang="en">Monsieur Marceau.</p>
