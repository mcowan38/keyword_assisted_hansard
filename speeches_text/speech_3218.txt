<p data-HoCid="8114882" data-originallang="fr">The deputy minister made it very clear that legal proceedings are currently under way against Laith Marouf. We have always denounced anti-Semitism and hate speech. We do not tolerate it in the Department of Canadian Heritage or in the government.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8114883" data-originallang="fr">I've spent my life defending minorities and others, including members of the LGBTQ2+ community, and I will not allow my colleague to say just anything about me. I refute all her claims. It's shameful to sit here and have to listen to that, Madam Chair.</p>
