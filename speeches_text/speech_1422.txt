<p data-HoCid="7016144" data-originallang="fr">It was stated in a press release that as of February 25, more than 13.8 million doses of vaccine were delivered by Canada through the COVAX mechanism. It was also said that through mechanisms that are not fully known, Canada had shared 762,080 doses under bilateral agreements with a number of Latin American and Caribbean countries.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7016145" data-originallang="fr"> As you know, Mr. Chair, we have expressed particular concern on a number of occasions for countries that are experiencing somewhat unique situations. I am thinking of Palestine, Taiwan and Haiti.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7016146" data-originallang="fr">Like Ukraine, many of our fellow citizens are from Haiti and are experiencing a major crisis, as you know. It is one of the poorest countries in the world; it experienced an earthquake and is going through a political crisis. We have given doses to Nicaragua, Argentina, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Peru, Barbados, Ecuador, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, and Jamaica on three occasions, but not one dose to Haiti.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7016147" data-originallang="fr">Why?</p>
