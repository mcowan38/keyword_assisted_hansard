<p data-HoCid="6784551" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Chair, and thank you to both witnesses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6784552" data-originallang="en">Mr. Geoffroy, thank you so much for the work you're doing. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6784553" data-originallang="en">You mentioned earlier the attack at the Quebec City mosque. Actually, I don't want to say his name, but the shooter was a law-abiding gun owner prior to going in and killing six men and wounding five others. Recently, in Quebec City, there was someone who was arrested in Mr. Lightbound's riding with an arsenal of weapons and bombs. There was a similar arrest in Alberta at the end of April. What is the connection with far-right extremism? </p>
<p data-HoCid="6784554" data-originallang="en">Obviously, at the Quebec City mosque, we're seeing a rise in anti-Semitism. We're also seeing a rise in Islamophobia. Neither is acceptable in any way. Could you talk about the connection between these terrorist acts, potential terrorist acts and far-right extremism?</p>
