<p data-HoCid="8639650" data-originallang="en"> Madam Speaker, today I am happy, on behalf of the people of Lakeland, to join the debate started by common-sense Conservatives because of the Liberals' repeated pattern of entitled and immoral abuse of Canadian tax dollars under the guise of programs ostensibly about issues that all Canadians care about. After nine years, the Liberals' corruption is just not worth the cost. The entire House of Commons asked for the Liberals to release documents about their major scandal but like always, the Liberals cover it up.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8639651" data-originallang="en">The Liberals presented the Sustainable Development Technology Canada fund, known accurately now as their personal green slush fund, as vital for investments to address climate change but it lacks transparency, fails to produce any results and, as always with these guys, serves the interests of Liberal insiders instead of Canadians. That is the Liberals' clear pattern: funnel other people's money into their friends' companies and pockets; sometimes get caught; evade, delay and obfuscate; and then finally, use every tool they have and all of their power to cover it all up and blame everyone else.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8639652" data-originallang="en">People might be inclined to dismiss this topic as just the way things are. They may say it is politics, that they are all the same, or that this is some political process or navel-gazing exercise where politicians talk to hear themselves speak about some obscure, out-of-touch process or parliamentary issue that does not really matter to everyday Canadians. However, that just is not true. It is, in fact, the uniquely Liberal pattern of mismanagement, wasteful spending and obvious ethical breaches apparently endorsed by the Liberals' coalition partners in the NDP and Bloc, since they do keep voting to prop them up and keep them in power, even though those so-called opposition parties do have the ability to stop it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8639653" data-originallang="en">The government must release the $400-million slush fund scheme records that show Liberal appointees funnelled Canadian tax dollars into their companies and their cronies' companies. The scale is simultaneously shocking and, horrifyingly, not surprising. We have nearly half of the billion-dollar slush fund of misused tax money with 186 conflicts of interest. What is wild here is that despite warnings about the conflicts of interest the head of the slush fund had, the Liberals put her in that key role anyway.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8639654" data-originallang="en">Another board member was the founder and CEO of a company called Cycle Capital. It so happens that the <a data-HoCid="278910" href="/politicians/steven-guilbeault/" title="Steven Guilbeault">environment minister</a> has personal shares in Cycle Capital and worked as a strategic adviser for it for over a decade. During that CEO's time on the slush fund, companies in which Cycle Capital invests received more than $100 million of tax dollars from the scheme. The Liberals took the head of Cycle Capital from the slush fund to the Liberals' Canada Infrastructure Bank, where she voted to give $170 million to her own company. We can talk about a conflict of interest. This is just one of many examples.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8639655" data-originallang="en">In my neck of the woods, and in my colleague's riding of <a data-HoCid="278139" href="/politicians/rick-perkins/" title="Rick Perkins">South Shore—St. Margarets</a>, we all know what they say of something that walks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck. I am confident Canadians can see what is happening here for themselves.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8639656" data-originallang="en"> Conservatives say if the Liberals have nothing to hide, then there is no reason to not release the documents. Since the Liberals are willing to stop all the work of the House of Commons, the people's place, to refuse to disclose the slush fund records, then they should just call a carbon tax election and let Canadians decide. Canadians deserve transparency and accountability. None of the government's money belongs to politicians, bureaucracies or government appointees. It belongs to Canadians. These are the kinds of things that people get fired for in the private sector. In governments that actually care about ethics and fiscal responsibility, elected people would resign or be fired.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8639657" data-originallang="en">However, it would be hard for the ethical offender-in-chief, the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, to have the credibility to mete out consequences with his own cabinet caucus and officials because this behaviour always has a role model at the top, but complicit participation is just as wrong. Canadians deserve to know how billions of their dollars have been misused over nine years, who benefits from the cover-ups and how it will be made right.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8639658" data-originallang="en">This pattern is also clear in the Liberals' claims about $120 billion for environmental programs. The intended outcomes often never materialize. For example, Lion Electric received millions from government, later declared bankruptcy and left nothing to show for the government's expenditure of Canadians' money, except failure, loss and broken promises. More than $40 billion of Canadians' money was allocated for EV subsidies, for example, yet infrastructure to make them actually affordable and suitable for Canadians' real lives, in every region of this country, lag far behind.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8639659" data-originallang="en"> Everything the Liberals claimed about the Stellantis subsidy has been proven false. It is billions of dollars over budget and years behind schedule, and this is before shovels are even in the ground. The Liberals said that it was supposed to create jobs for Canadians, but at least 1,500 jobs, the majority, will be filled by temporary foreign workers.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8639660" data-originallang="en">While the Liberals claim over and over again that these programs serve Canadians, the funds instead benefit companies or cronies with Liberal connections. The Liberals' fast-and-loose approach to tax dollars, feathering the nests of their fellow elites in either full complicity or through a lack of action on ethical violations, is the Liberal jam. The Liberals used to wax eloquent about the disinfecting nature of sunshine and sunny ways, but, after nine years, what they deliver is costly collusion and cover-up after cover-up.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8639661" data-originallang="en"> The Auditor General repeatedly points out that there is a lack of clear goals and oversight. Programs are launched without plans or, for many of their so-called environmental initiatives, without any way to measure impacts or even emissions reductions. By omission or by design, the Liberals make it nearly impossible to assess progress or ensure responsible use and oversight of tax dollars. The Liberals obstruct efforts to hold the government accountable with vague responses, if a response is provided at all, and they withhold documents so Canadians cannot know whether their own public money is being wasted.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8639662" data-originallang="en"> Just last year, I submitted an access to information request on the costs the federal government cites related to Canada's environmental targets. Documents show that the government held back information and deliberately strategized to deny the answers to me, and therefore all Canadians, with vague language and redirection to publicly available government and external non-government sources. In both instances, the replies did not include a single specific figure that was explicitly requested. Unfortunately, it is a fact that this reflects a pattern overall, which is the opposite, of course, of openness, transparency and accountability. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8639663" data-originallang="en">While the government claims to spend tax dollars on green projects, there is often actually no way to know if these projects even exist, never mind assessing the outcomes or results that all Canadians would care about. One of the most striking scandals involves government contracts to McKinsey &amp; Company. After nine years, the Liberals gave them $200 million of Canadian money. The Auditor General uncovered “frequent disregard for procurement” rules, including the failure to justify sole-sourced contracts for 18 of the 19 awards to the firm. The Liberals bypassed their own government's required procurement policy to do it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8639664" data-originallang="en"> It is a long, flagrant disregard for ethical and fiscal decision-making and a pattern of noncompliance. No wonder Canadians lose faith in governments, politicians and bureaucracy when the government refuses to show the value for the Canadian money that it spends. Government departments frequently failed to estimate the cost of McKinsey's services beforehand. Out of 33 contracts reviewed, cost estimates were only provided in three cases that had been given to McKinsey that actually included cost estimates to protect Canadians' money. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8639665" data-originallang="en">The truth is that, after nine years, these Liberals are not just the masters of a flawed procurement process. They also actively ignore and choose not to fix it, to the benefit of themselves and their buddies. Of course, the firm's former global director enjoys a close relationship with the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> and advised senior officials on economic policy, so it is obvious that McKinsey's influence on public policy was part of a broader network of favouritism. The Auditor General noted the rapid growth in McKinsey's contracts with the Liberals after nine years. Canadians can be forgiven for seeing this exactly as it is: elite, political insider favouritism with Canadians' money.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8639666" data-originallang="en"> One $33-million government contract to McKinsey for the government-caused, beleaguered and delayed Trans Mountain expansion was issued non-competitively and without a justification being clearly linked to one of the competitive procurement policy exceptions. Another example, of course, is the Canada Infrastructure Bank, which oversees more than $30 billion in public-private infrastructure spending. More than half its board members have ties to the Liberal Party, including former Liberal candidates, donors, staff and board members. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8639667" data-originallang="en">Common-sense Conservatives warned repeatedly about this boondoggle of mismanagement and no accountability, but the Liberals initially gave it 35 billion tax dollars, and after nine years, it has produced very little to show for all that money spent. Despite grand promises of transformational infrastructure projects, it must remain in early planning stages, stalled or not exist at all. It is not just about missed deadlines. It really shows systemic inefficiencies and abysmal project management, with Liberal insiders appointed to high-level positions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8639668" data-originallang="en"> These are choices made over and over. These are staggering numbers for most of us to even begin to comprehend. It is no wonder that Canadians question the impartiality and governance of the Liberals, their banks, their boards and their panels. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8639669" data-originallang="en"> The government claims that billions are earmarked for infrastructure, but so much is all tied up with insiders. The Liberal government sent half a billion dollars to the Asian Infrastructure Bank. Its former head of global communications told the parliamentary committee that Canada has not received “a single thing of tangible value” from a quarter of a billion tax dollars. He said that he is unaware of the Liberal's demand for a return of that money. Unfortunately, this is also reflective of most of the government's apparent environmental initiatives. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8639670" data-originallang="en">However, all of this is really about a larger problem. The Liberal government's spending decisions are driven more by ideology and political optics than by the best interests of Canadians or, for many of these examples, the actual environmental impact. By focusing on headline grabbing and ribbon cutting rather than practical solutions and outcomes, the government has wasted billions of dollars of other people's money. The Liberals' own endless tax-and-spend, rat-trap cycle has made all the essentials too expensive for everyone, hollowed out the middle class and particularly harmed low-income and working poor Canadians. Really, it is disgusting. It is a gross Liberal pattern. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8639671" data-originallang="en">The Liberals' WE Charity scandal is one of the most infamous, with a $900-million contract ostensibly for a student grant program. Of course, Liberal family members of the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> had long been paid to appear at events, and both the relatives of the then finance minister and senior government officials had close connections with WE. All of that benefited the Liberals and the charity. The Ethics Commissioner ruled that the then finance minister acted unethically and breached the Conflict of Interest Act when he failed to recuse himself from the decision. After Conservatives pushed the government relentlessly to release those documents, it ultimately cancelled the contract. However, this was not done before the Liberals hid the details; ultimately, they shut down Parliament to avoid accountability and left Canadians in the dark. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8639672" data-originallang="en">The Liberals tried yet another cover-up on the Winnipeg lab leak in 2021. There were reports that the RCMP had to intervene at that one-of-a-kind, top medical and virus lab. This was because of a security breach and speculation of espionage by China's Communist dictatorship at that Canadian lab. The <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> fought tooth and nail to prevent any of the documents from coming up. As he is doing now, he defied a motion passed by elected MPs. All parties that had seen the documents, including a Liberal MP, said that this was to cover up embarrassment, not to protect national security. Time and time again, the Liberals repeatedly prioritize political interests over genuine public benefit. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8639673" data-originallang="en">Withholding information from MPs, who are here because of and to serve the people, shows without a doubt the Liberals' total disregard for ethical governance. All these scandals do, and there are many more. This undermines public trust. These are ongoing issues of favouritism, lack of transparency and poor governance. Canadians clearly cannot afford or trust the Liberal government and its coalition partners, which is the serious consequence that happens when public money is funnelled by the Liberals to politically connected corporations and insiders. When any accountability and transparency is lacking, this leaves Canadians wondering where all their money has gone. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8639674" data-originallang="en">We can consider the scale and what this actually means. The nearly $400 million blown by the Liberal slush fund alone would require the equivalent of 22,000 Canadian families to work an entire year just to cover the amount through their federal taxes. After nine years of the Liberals, costs are up and taxes are up; therefore, in reality, all those Canadian families are already working their butts off and cannot get ahead. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8639675" data-originallang="en">This conduct is not acceptable at any time. However, the same government's spending and carbon taxes have caused inflation and a historic cost of living crisis by driving up the prices of groceries, fuel, housing and heating. These are essentials, not luxuries, in Canada, especially with winter coming. When such things happen, better accountability and oversight of tax money is the very least that Canadians deserve.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8639676" data-originallang="en"> A recurring theme is the government's absolute failure to deliver on promises of job creation and economic growth. It frequently promotes its green programs and infrastructure projects as job creators, but many of the jobs that are created are temporary or disappear once construction phases end. This has been especially problematic in growing sectors such as renewable energy, where employment opportunities are promised during government announcements at project launches but never materialize. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8639677" data-originallang="en"> In addition, who can forget the Liberals' tree planting failure? In 2019, the Liberals promised to plant two billion trees, but as of last year there were deals to plant only 374 million trees by 2031, which is less than 19% of their stated goal. NRCan reports that only 56 million trees have been planted to date; that is not even 3% of the Liberals' promise.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8639678" data-originallang="en">Meanwhile, traditional sectors like oil and gas, where hundreds of thousands of Canadians work and that remain vital to Canada's economy, have been subjected to uncertainty, extra-heavy regulation, prohibitions, unfair treatment and carbon taxes. Canada has lost hundreds of thousands of jobs because the costly coalition wages an ideological war on energy workers.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8639679" data-originallang="en">The Liberals' scandals and mismanagement are not isolated incidents. It is their long-established grift. From the mishandling of programs to insider deals, it is clear that public resources are being misused and Canadians are being shortchanged. After nine years of the NDP-Liberals' anti-energy, anti-private-sector policies, more than $5.6 trillion of investments in jobs, businesses, projects, talent and technology have gone from Canada to the U.S., a unique reversal since the Liberals were elected in 2015. It has gotten worse every year.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8639680" data-originallang="en">There is no doubt that the Liberal government, backed by the coalition, are the most ethically compromised government in Canadian history. The <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">PM</a> has been convicted of two ethics violations, and so have four senior Liberal MPs, the most of any government in Canadian history. At the same time, the Liberals have made it so that two-thirds of lower-income families struggle to eat, to heat their home and to house themselves, due to the government-caused cost of living crisis. It is just unacceptable that tax dollars are wasted, period. Especially now, Canadians deserve a government that puts their interests first, manages their tax dollars responsibly and delivers real results.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8639681" data-originallang="en">The Liberals' actions, their being their willingness to stop everything to cover up, are obviously a deliberate attempt to shield their own corruption from public scrutiny. The Auditor General already uncovered instances where slush fund officials directed tax money to their own companies. The Ethics Commissioner ruled that the fund's chair, personally appointed by the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, broke the law. It is not just common-sense Conservatives saying that; it is common sense.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8639682" data-originallang="en">Elected leadership must prioritize ethics, transparency, accountability and effective governance. Environmental policy should be about stewardship, conservation, mitigation and adaptation, and it should benefit all Canadians, not just the well-connected few in certain regions. Enough is enough. Parliament must do its job, since the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> and the Liberals will not.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8639683" data-originallang="en">The Liberals must comply with Parliament's demand and release the green slush fund documents because the demand comes from the representatives of the majority of Canadians. That is whom we are here to represent, whom we work for and whom we are to serve. When the majority of members of Parliament in the House of Commons make a demand, those are the people for whom they are making that request.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8639684" data-originallang="en">However, after nine years of the NDP-Liberals, taxes are up, costs are up and crime is up, and I think Canadians think that time is up for the Liberal government. If the Liberals have nothing to hide, they should call a carbon tax election to let Canadians decide to end wasteful spending, restore accountability and bring home transparency so common-sense Conservatives can axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime. It is time.</p>
