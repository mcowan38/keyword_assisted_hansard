<p data-HoCid="6706041" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I obviously share the member's view that the government needs to continue to work with all parliamentarians in the interests of protecting Canadians including the most vulnerable Canadians. I know her city of Winnipeg well. I know the riding of <a data-HoCid="253019" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>. My colleague from <a data-HoCid="252532" href="/politicians/kevin-lamoureux/" title="Kevin Lamoureux">Winnipeg North</a> often discusses with us the challenges that people in that great city face. That is why our government, including the <a data-HoCid="253395" href="/politicians/patty-hajdu/" title="Patty Hajdu">Minister of Health</a>, is constantly looking at ways that we can improve the protection and the safety and security of Canadians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6706042" data-originallang="en">My colleague spoke of political games. Once again, I would draw to her attention that in a vote on the budget on the Bloc Québécois subamendment, which was a vote of confidence, a number of NDP members stood and voted no confidence in the government. Had that subamendment passed with some of the NDP members voting in favour of it, we would be in an immediate election today. I do not think my colleague would find that helpful for the people of <a data-HoCid="253019" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> as well.</p>
