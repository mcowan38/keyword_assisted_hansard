<p data-HoCid="6271661" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, Monday was Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. As the Jewish new year begins, there has been an alarming increase in anti-Semitic incidents across the globe, most of which originate online. We need to find better ways to combat online hate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6271662" data-originallang="en">As such, we have launched the Inter-Parliamentary Task Force to Combat Online Anti-Semitism. The hon. member for <a data-HoCid="252989" href="/politicians/marty-morantz/" title="Marty Morantz">Charleswood—St. James—Assiniboia—Headingley</a> and I have joined this bipartisan group of members of the national legislatures of Australia, Israel, the United Kingdom and the United States to help confront anti-Semitism online.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6271663" data-originallang="en">The task force has the following goals: holding social media platforms accountable; adopting and publishing transparent policies related to hate speech; raising awareness about anti-Semitism on social media platforms; and underscoring that the fight against anti-Semitism and other forms of hate is a non-partisan consensus in Canada and other democratic countries.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6271664" data-originallang="en">As we move forward with our work, I look forward to collaborating with members of the House across party lines on this incredibly important issue.</p>
