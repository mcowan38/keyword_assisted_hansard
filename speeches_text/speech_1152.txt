<p data-HoCid="6791817" data-originallang="en"> There are also the other factors. Within the negotiations between Fatah and Hamas in the lead-up to the elections, they tried to reach an agreement and have a unified Palestinian government, and those negotiations were ultimately unsuccessful. Furthermore, within Fatah, there were a lot of different political ambitions and machinations, which made it very difficult to have an outcome that would bring the stability that I think the PA and president wanted. Very much, it was difficult for a variety of reasons.</p>
