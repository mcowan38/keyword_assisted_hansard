<p data-HoCid="7931248" data-originallang="fr">I understand from the Prime Minister's response that he has not called President Zelenskyy, who is the biggest victim of this terrible mistake after Jewish communities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7931249" data-originallang="fr">Can he correct that mistake, call President Zelenskyy and make sure we counterbalance Russian propaganda? Also, can the government make an urgent effort, both in Canada and elsewhere, to embark on a healing process with Jewish communities?</p>
