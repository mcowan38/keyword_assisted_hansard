<p data-HoCid="7159186" data-originallang="en">That was one of the things we talked about when we did Rona Ambrose's bill and then the Judges Act. I had the privilege of sitting on the justice committee. If you recall, the bill actually added in the last version of systemic racism. Originally, we added social context to it as well, to ensure the types of things that you're talking about. We can't prescribe what judges will do in their training, but we can do as much as we can in the wording in the legislation. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7159187" data-originallang="en"> I think those issues you've talked about, MP Gazan, are so important. It is there in previous wording, but I'm pretty sure the judges are watching right now. I think we can all send a very strong message to them that they need to ensure they're speaking to the right organizations and the right people to make sure that their training is reflective of everyone across Canada.</p>
