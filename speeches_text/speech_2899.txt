<p data-HoCid="7988294" data-originallang="en">Thank you for the question. It's a thoughtful question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988295" data-originallang="en"> I appreciate the impact this conflict is having on Canadians. We see it among our staff members at our embassies and our local staff as well, and we feel for them, evidently.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988296" data-originallang="en">I am not in a position to judge on “collective punishment” as a term. It is a term that has been used, but it's a term that has specific meaning as well.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988297" data-originallang="en">Israel's right to self-defence that we were referring to before has circumscriptions, and we want to remind them of that—that the protection of civilians remains paramount and that we need to make sure that civilians have access to humanitarian assistance. This is our focus right now, and we will continue to focus on that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988298" data-originallang="en">We feel for two and a half million Palestinians in Gaza, and they require humanitarian assistance. As an international community, we need to carry that message forward in an effective way.</p>
