<p data-HoCid="8765361" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8765362" data-originallang="en"> Thank you to our witnesses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8765363" data-originallang="en"> I am very concerned about the rising problem of anti-Semitism on university campuses. I do want to focus in this round on some of the potential linkages between that and questions on research funding.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8765364" data-originallang="en">Just to put the problem in perspective, first of all, it's been reported that there were over 5,700 anti-Semitic incidents in Canada in 2023, and it is deeply troubling to see a substantial number of those incidents happening on university campuses, with very anti-Semitic statements made by certain groups, for example, as well as various incidents.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8765365" data-originallang="en"> I wanted to ask, just in terms of research proposals, is it fair to say that you have a process whereby you would seek to screen out research proposals that promote racist or other discriminatory ideas or narratives? Would that apply to anti-Semitism as well?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8765366" data-originallang="en">Maybe Dr. Hewitt is a logical place to go to with this.</p>
