<p data-HoCid="8543030" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8543031" data-originallang="en">I would like to start with refuting what I believe to be a false narrative at this committee. I've listened very carefully to my Liberal colleagues. I've listened to some of the commentary from these witnesses. I guess to a Canadian observer who is not entirely familiar with the circumstances that surrounded the creation of this particular meeting, one would think that all is well in Canada and that everything is working as it's intended to work: that CSIS is working appropriately; that the CBSA is working appropriately; that law enforcement's working appropriately; and that the government is doing its job. That can't be further from the truth. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8543032" data-originallang="en">The number one responsibility of <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Justin Trudeau</a> and his government and the number one responsibility of the CBSA and of CSIS is to keep Canadians safe, not some of the time, but all of the time. What has happened here is that we were within a hair's breadth—minutes, hours or potentially days away—of a mass casualty event on the Toronto Jewish community.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8543033" data-originallang="en">Clearly, this wasn't hatched overnight by the two accused. They were probably planning for days, weeks or months, all under the radar of CSIS, all under the radar of immigration, all under the radar of CBSA and all under the radar of our law enforcement. Therefore, I have one phrase to say to this committee and to Canadians: Thank God for France. Thank God for French intelligence, which gave CSIS the tip. This wasn't a national in France who was planning something against Canadians. This was an individual whom we granted Canadian citizenship to and who completely fell under the radar map until a tip went to CSIS, and then CSIS got the RCMP involved, and we stopped what could have been a significant mass casualty event.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8543034" data-originallang="en">I'm sorry to all the witnesses. You failed in your responsibilities to keep us safe. You didn't do your jobs. But for the grace of God and good French intelligence, they are behind bars, where they should be.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8543035" data-originallang="en">I listened very carefully to Mr. McCrorie's words. We have a “robust” and “thorough” system. Our reviews of individuals coming into our country take time. You talked about what Canadians expect. Well, sir, I can tell you that I have reports from news media that strongly suggest that the two accused in custody is by no means a one-off.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8543036" data-originallang="en">In fact, I'm going to read from this report. This is from the National Post a few weeks ago: American authorities “recently announced the apprehension of 233 terrorist suspects seeking entry from Canada into the United States.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8543037" data-originallang="en"> Were you aware of that, CSIS?</p>
