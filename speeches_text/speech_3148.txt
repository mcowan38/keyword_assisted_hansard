<p data-HoCid="8098468" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098469" data-originallang="en">I want to speak to Canada's commitment to a rules-based system in relation to the very currency of diplomacy: international law. In particular, I will focus on Canada's approach to prosecuting international crimes, war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098470" data-originallang="en">Canada has done a great deal to support accountability efforts in recent years. Since 2022, Canada has consistently supported the prosecution of international crimes in Ukraine. Along with the Netherlands, Canada has taken Syria to the International Court of Justice over torture. However, many question why there are so many inconsistencies in Canada's support for international law and accountability efforts.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098471" data-originallang="en">I would like to explore two questions that I believe are instructive in relation to Canada's position on prosecuting international crimes and standing in the world.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098472" data-originallang="en">First, what would Canada do if a mid-level Russian or Syrian war criminal or a member of the Wagner Group entered Canada? As a signatory of the Geneva Conventions, Canada is obligated to investigate war crimes and prosecute them in its own courts.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098473" data-originallang="en">Canada's diplomatic partners would expect it to prosecute and not become a safe haven for war criminals, yet all too often, Canada does nothing or attempts to deport alleged war criminals instead of prosecuting them. If Canada does deport those alleged war criminals, it seeks zero guarantees that they will be held accountable in the country to which they are deported.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098474" data-originallang="en">In 2016, the Department of Justice released a report which stated that over 200 perpetrators of international crimes reside in Canada. Canada has not prosecuted any of them. Canada has the laws to do it and it has the resources to do it, but it won't do it. Unlike its allies, since the early 2010s, Canada has abandoned the use of universal jurisdiction.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098475" data-originallang="en">My second question is, what would Canada do if the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for senior Hamas leaders and those responsible for atrocities committed on October 7? There is a real prospect that this will happen in the coming weeks and months. What would Canada say to the Israeli families who have asked the International Criminal Court to investigate Hamas's crimes? What would it say to Palestinians?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098476" data-originallang="en">Right now, the only answer that is consistent with Canadian policy would be that Canada would oppose ICC warrants for Hamas leaders because Canada believes that Palestine is not a state and therefore the ICC plays no role in Israel or Palestine. Indeed, Canada has opposed every single independent and impartial international effort to investigate and prosecute international crimes committed in Israel and Palestine—every single one.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098477" data-originallang="en">The question arises, what are the rules when Canada supports victims and survivors in some places some of the times, but not in other places at other times? Those who look to Canada—victims of atrocities, diplomats, staff in international organizations, others that I engage with on an almost day-to-day basis—want leadership, and not just on a rules-based system. They want a consistent rules-based system. They still expect Canada to lead, but they wonder why in so many cases it's unwilling and unable to do so.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098478" data-originallang="en"> It's not too late. I believe Canada can lead, and I'd like to offer a few recommendations. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8098479" data-originallang="en">One, establish a diplomatic post for an ambassador for international justice to help coordinate accountability efforts here and abroad.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098480" data-originallang="en">Two, invest in holding atrocity perpetrators living in our midst, in our communities here, to account in our courts under universal jurisdiction or work with the deportation destination countries to ensure they are held to account there.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098481" data-originallang="en">Three, support the ICC in all situations under its jurisdiction. To do so, Canada does not need to recognize that Palestine is a state. Belgium and Switzerland, two close allies of ours, have recognized that the ICC has a role to play, and neither currently recognizes Palestine as a state.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098482" data-originallang="en">Four, study the possible creation of an additional hybrid court for Israel and Palestine staffed by international prosecutors and judges, with some Israeli and Palestinian staff as well.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098483" data-originallang="en">Five, lead international efforts to trace and, where possible, seize assets of perpetrators of international crimes: transnational organized crimes like human trafficking and money laundering and large-scale corruption. These crimes are linked and they should be investigated and prosecuted as such.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098484" data-originallang="en"> Finally, support efforts to amend the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court so that the court can prosecute the crime of aggression, including a situation dear to our hearts in Ukraine.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098485" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much. I look forward to your comments and questions. </p>
