<p data-HoCid="7952754" data-originallang="en">I want to cite...because I believe.... I have enormous respect for Ms. Gladu. She seemed to pooh-pooh the 90% figure I mentioned earlier. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7952755" data-originallang="en">The Anti-Defamation League published its report earlier this year, in February. Here is the headline: </p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7952756" data-originallang="en"> Right-wing extremists committed every ideologically driven mass killing identified in the U.S. in 2022, with an “unusually high” proportion perpetrated by white supremacists, according to a new report published [by the Anti-Defamation League last] Thursday. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7952757" data-originallang="en">This is dated February 23, 2023—this year:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7952758" data-originallang="en"> The number of mass killings linked to extremism in the U.S. in the past decade was at least three times higher than any decade since the 1970s, per the report. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7952759" data-originallang="en">I flagged 90%. However, in terms of ideologically driven mass killings, the Anti-Defamation League identifies 100% of the killings taking place in 2022 in the United States—including attacks against the Jewish community, the Muslim community and the LGBTQ community—as being committed by far-right terrorists.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7952760" data-originallang="en">This is not a childish game. This is not something that should give pause or...is a matter of freedom of expression. This is a real and present danger to the lives of so many minority communities and to our democracy. I would hope that all colleagues around this table understand the enormity when the Anti-Defamation League tells us every single ideologically driven mass killing in 2022 was committed by far-right extremists, and that we take it seriously and understand the degree to which hate speech and hate-driven agendas are having an influence on the safety of so many of our citizens.</p>
