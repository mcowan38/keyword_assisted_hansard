<p data-HoCid="7988231" data-originallang="en">Do you know if Internet service is available to people out there? I've been contacted by people who have family out there. They're not necessarily Canadian citizens, but they're family to Canadians. I have received unofficial notes on the number of casualties on the Gaza and Ramallah side who are cousins of Canadians. It's a very high number. It's a very troubling number. I have asked those families whether they've been able to connect with their families or their parents out there. Again, they could be Canadians or non-Canadians. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7988232" data-originallang="en">Is there any information from the ground through our teams on whether Internet service is at least available so that these people can have the chance to connect and report and tell us what's going on and we can know the path forward to be able to save as many lives as we can?</p>
