<p data-HoCid="8396558" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8396559" data-originallang="en">I wanted to follow up on one of the questions I asked that the officials answer with regard to Bill <a data-HoCid="12265330" href="/bills/44-1/C-41/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code and to make consequential amendments to other Acts">C-41</a>, that clarification on the funds that have been sent to Afghanistan since Bill C-41 was enacted. Please clarify when you submit that back to the committee whether those organizations are Canadian or whether those organizations are multilateral organizations. Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8396560" data-originallang="en">Then, I would also go back to the minister.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8396561" data-originallang="en">I know I threw a lot at you, Minister, right before I ran out of time, but I would like to ask the question again. Can you please state that a Liberal government would not accept any solution to rebuilding Gaza that denies the right of Gazans to return to their land?</p>
