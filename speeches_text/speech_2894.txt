<p data-HoCid="8004750" data-originallang="en">I think the issue of global conflict is certainly front and centre in all of our minds. Certainly at the department, we've played an active role, whether it's looking at issues related to the war in Ukraine or the conflict between Israel and Hamas. Across the department, through our numerous geographic bureaus and through our network of embassies, high commissions and consulates around the world, we're very alive to the potential for conflict and certainly report back through headquarters and across the interdepartmental community when issues arise that need to be flagged.</p>
