<p data-HoCid="8695668" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8695669" data-originallang="en">By my understanding, both of you were born and raised in Canada. I've seen you both for decades work as activists for human rights of not only Sikh Canadians but also others. I know you've both been very active on indigenous rights. I know Balpreet Singh has done a lot of work with Jewish groups, Muslim groups, and other impoverished groups. I know you, Moninder Singh, have done a lot for indigenous groups. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8695670" data-originallang="en">When we talk about human rights, Balpreet mentioned a very important point. Sometimes governments trade off the human rights of another country versus trade. In this case, we're talking about the human rights of Canadians, not the citizens of another country. It's really appalling that it has stepped into not only another country, which we've always known, but now right here in Canada. For that, I acknowledge your courage and commend you for standing up despite that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8695671" data-originallang="en">Moninder Singh, can you speak about the weeks and months prior to Hardeep Singh Nijjar's death? There were lots of rumours, and even after, about organized crime calling for a hit on Mr. Nijjar. In fact, I got my information from people like you, and others before the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> unveiled it in September. There was a whisper, as Balpreet Singh said, that there was Indian involvement. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8695672" data-originallang="en">Can you shed some light on what you felt, beyond what would go into a trial situation?</p>
