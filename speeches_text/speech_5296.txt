<p data-HoCid="8693765" data-originallang="fr">You argued that recognizing a Palestinian state could strengthen the two-state solution. Can you tell us a little more specifically about the outcome we might expect if Canada were to take the step of recognizing the Palestinian state? What would be the positive impact not only on Israeli politics, but also on regional dynamics? You mentioned earlier that this could give Palestine the status it needs to undertake these important negotiations on an equal footing, but beyond that, would there be more concrete results?</p>
