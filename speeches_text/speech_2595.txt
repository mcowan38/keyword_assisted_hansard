<p data-HoCid="7957470" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, I am not going to speculate on what Hamas might or might not do.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957471" data-originallang="en">What I will say is that Hamas must release the some 199 hostages they are currently holding, three of whom may be Canadian citizens. We will be watching very carefully to see what Hamas does with these three missing Canadians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957472" data-originallang="en">I would further add that Hamas is a listed terrorist entity under the Criminal Code of Canada. As such, providing material support to this organization within Canada is a criminal offence, something that we expect our law enforcement to prosecute to the full extent of the law.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957473" data-originallang="en">Let us be clear here, Hamas has been an organization in the Middle East that has created great misery, not just for Israelis but for Palestinians themselves. The elimination of Hamas will hopefully lead to a two-state solution that would allow the Palestinians to fulfill their aspirations to live in their own country, side by side, peacefully among the community of nations.</p>
