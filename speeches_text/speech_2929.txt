<p data-HoCid="8019143" data-originallang="en">There have been comments made in this committee over the last little while about the scourge of anti-Semitism. I think it's really important for every single person in this room to condemn those things when they are heard and when they are seen. I think it's important for members opposite to condemn those members of their party who chose to have dinner with a raging anti-Semite, Islamophobe and neo-Nazi. I am still waiting for every single member opposite to do that because, my goodness, if we are going to hold ourselves to that standard, then we must all be held to that standard. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8019144" data-originallang="en">I take great pride and great responsibility in ensuring that when I see an act of anti-Semitism or Islamophobia or hatred that I speak out against it. That is our obligation, even when our colleagues are doing that. It is important for us not to equivocate on this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8019145" data-originallang="en">I look forward, as part of this conversation, for the members opposite, who have yet to apologize unreservedly for the actions of their colleagues and their party in hosting an anti-Semite from Germany, from a neo-Nazi organizationâ€”</p>
