<p data-HoCid="8117651" data-originallang="en">I think we have to utilize the technology. For instance, in the call centre, we've adopted robotic processing so that the triaging of documents coming in is not done manually. They're set up in a system so that an officer looking at a case will have all the documents uploaded in one place, versus grabbing them from the various locations they may be in. Using automation, from that standpoint, is helpful.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8117652" data-originallang="en">In the context of the AG report, I would say that what we try to do is.... There are some cases that are more complex than others. That is the nature of the immigration system. I think we need to do a better job of reporting, and we hope that by using automation to triage the processing, we make it easier for officers to review the files they are reviewing. For the more straightforward applications, the benefit is that it's faster. However, it can also benefit the other, more complex cases in the system. We have more people allocated to doing those files if we're using automation technologies to help with the more straightforward ones.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8117653" data-originallang="en"> Where the AG's report is helpful to us.... Her team indicated that we need to explain and report on how we do all cases. All people benefit from automation, not just those who fall into the automation categories. The resource allocation distribution that we can do is a benefit for all clients. We just need to demonstrate that clearly.</p>
