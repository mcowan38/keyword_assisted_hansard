<p data-HoCid="8124721" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8124722" data-originallang="en">Thank you to our witnesses for appearing. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8124723" data-originallang="en">We all watched the horrific atrocities committed by Hamas on October 7 against some 1,200 Israeli civilians. Not only were they killed by Hamas, but many of them were also brutally tortured, mutilated and raped. In addition, more than 200 Israeli and other citizens were taken hostage. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8124724" data-originallang="en">You mentioned in your opening remarks that the Government of Canada assesses that these hostage-takings of some 200 civilians are a violation of international law. The fourth Geneva convention and the 1977 Geneva convention make it clear that the taking of civilian hostages is strictly forbidden at all times and by all parties and constitutes war crimes. In fact, the conventions refer to “grave breaches” of international law. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8124725" data-originallang="en">In addition to the government assessing that these hostage-takings were violations of international law, does the Government of Canada assess that these hostage-takings constitute war crimes?</p>
