<p data-HoCid="6845166" data-originallang="en">Excuse me for one minute, colleagues.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6845167" data-originallang="en">The bells are ringing in the House. Therefore, we require unanimous consent to continue. Ms. Gazan actually only has about another minute to go, so I don't think it's much of an imposition. Are we okay just to finish up this round, and then we'll adjourn?</p>
<p data-HoCid="6845168" data-originallang="en">We are. Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6845169" data-originallang="en">Ms. Gazan, go ahead.</p>
