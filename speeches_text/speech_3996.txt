<p data-HoCid="8391220" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8391221" data-originallang="en">Notice was given of this motion on April 18, and the motion reads as follows. I move that,</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8391222" data-originallang="en"> Given that, according to a National Post article published on April 17, a York University faculty committee has presented a list of anti-Semitic recommendations that include labelling the support of Israel as “anti-Palestinian racism”; classifying anyone who supports Israel as “anti-Palestinian, Islamophobic, and anti-Arab”; granting academic freedom and free speech to pro-Palestinian students, while revoking these same rights from Jewish students and anyone supportive of Israel; and identifying Zionism as “a settler colonial project and ethno-religious ideology” that should be isolated and destroyed, and that </p>
<p data-HoCid="8391223" data-originallang="en"> the Government of Canada has committed to the Canada anti-racism strategy, and that </p>
<p data-HoCid="8391224" data-originallang="en"> the Minister of Canadian Heritage is responsible for “fostering and promoting Canadian identity and values, cultural development, and heritage,” and that </p>
<p data-HoCid="8391225" data-originallang="en"> the 2024 Canadian universities anti-Semitism report highlights the “serious problems our universities have with antisemitism, anti-Zionism and anti-Jewish hate”, </p>
<p data-HoCid="8391226" data-originallang="en"> the committee unequivocally condemn the anti-Semitic conduct of this faculty committee at York University and report this to the House. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8391227" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, it is important to note that the motion I have just read into the record does call on this committee to unequivocally condemn the anti-Semitic conduct of the anti-Jew faculty committee at York University. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8391228" data-originallang="en">I gave notice of this motion on April 18. However, since then, in just those few weeks, anti-Jewish rhetoric and actions on campuses across this country have only grown in number. In fact, it is out of control and altogether vile and disgusting. It is inexcusable, and this committee has an opportunity to do something about it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8391229" data-originallang="en">Jewish students should not fear going to class, writing their final exams or attending their convocation, but that is in fact where we are at as a country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8391230" data-originallang="en">Anti-Jew mobs are active at McGill University, the University of Ottawa, Western University, Carleton University, and now, as of this morning, the University of Toronto.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8391231" data-originallang="en">This government has signed off on and committed to the Canada anti-racism strategy, which is led by the <a data-HoCid="300004" href="/politicians/pascale-st-onge/" title="Pascale St-Onge">Minister of Heritage</a>, and it is incumbent upon her to abide by her mandate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8391232" data-originallang="en">Today we have another opportunity here at this table, and it seems an opportunity that should elicit the collaboration of those here. The hatred facing Jews in Canada should be condemned in the strongest terms possible. We cannot sit idly by and be silent as those within our community are suffering.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8391233" data-originallang="en">I sincerely hope that my Liberal colleagues, especially, will not try to water down or equivocate the motion I am moving and its purpose to help Jews who are experiencing real terror.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8391234" data-originallang="en">All of us should agree that it is wrong to perpetuate hate toward the Jewish community in Canada, which is why I was confused and grieved as to why my desire to seek unanimous consent to see the motion moved and adopted at the last committee meeting was rejected. However, it does remain tabled, so I do wish to move it today. I remain hopeful that my colleagues across the way will have had a change of heart and will perhaps see the light and vote in favour of this motion. I would ask that it be voted on at this time.</p>
