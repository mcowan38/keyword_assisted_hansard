<p data-HoCid="6382801" data-originallang="en">Sure. I'm happy to add a couple of points to what Ambassador Rae has just said.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6382802" data-originallang="en">Obviously, we're not happy to be in a position where we can't pay our own staff, the teachers, the health workers and others who provide these services to Palestinians. We would be very grateful for any additional support that enables us to keep providing those services to Palestinian citizens.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6382803" data-originallang="en">COVID has hit hard in Gaza and the West Bank. We've been able to get some assistance to help with that, but the underlying issues still faced in those places are acute. Millions of Palestinians are reliant on services that our Palestinian agency provides. We're broken-hearted, really, that this is now under threat. </p>
