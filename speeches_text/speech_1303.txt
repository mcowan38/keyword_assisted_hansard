<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I want to follow up on what was just asked. The <a data-HoCid="278714" href="/politicians/jagmeet-singh/" title="Jagmeet Singh">leader of the NDP</a> just apologized for the hateful comments that came from the member of his caucus for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>. Will this member be sanctioned for her very callous and hateful comments about the Ukrainian army, as well as the people of Ukraine? Never mind the Ukrainian Canadians who make up a large percentage of her own riding of Winnipeg Centre, including the headquarters of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress, which is in Winnipeg Centre.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">To have one of his members get up and try to label those who are fighting for their freedom today as Nazis and calling them anti-Semitic, to me, is deplorable. I would ask that the leader of the NDP sanction that individual in his caucus.</p>
