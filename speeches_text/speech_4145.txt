<p data-HoCid="8406267" data-originallang="en"> Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8406268" data-originallang="en"> I come to this table in, perhaps, a unique situation for the people at this table, because I'm not only a Jewish woman, but I am a Jewish mother of two Jewish students on university campuses in North America right now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8406269" data-originallang="en">I really thank all of the students for coming here and speaking. I have indirectly, through my children, been living that reality, and it is so important that you've come here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8406270" data-originallang="en">I want to thank Anthony for having spearheaded this study, because I think it's really important that we take that moment.... I just want to put that out there.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8406271" data-originallang="en"> If I seem emotional, it's because I am. This is personal, just as it is for you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8406272" data-originallang="en">Yesterday, I heard—and I think you mentioned this in some of your speeches—about holding Jewish events, and then being told they can't happen in that way or that you are seeing them disrupted. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8406273" data-originallang="en">Maybe I can start with Nati. I was going to use the example of the International Holocaust Remembrance Day.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8406274" data-originallang="en">At Queen's were you able to commemorate that day in the same way as you would have in past years?</p>
