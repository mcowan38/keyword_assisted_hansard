<p data-HoCid="6764778" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Ms. Gazan.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6764779" data-originallang="en"> Ms. Gibbons, Ms. Goulding and Mr. Conrad, thank you so much for being with us and for your answers to our questions. They will, undoubtedly, be extremely valuable in putting together a report for government. We very much appreciate your service to your country and to government and the professional and patient way that you've carried yourselves today. Thank you so much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6764780" data-originallang="en">I have one brief question for my colleagues. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6764781" data-originallang="en">Witnesses, thanks. You're free to go if you wish.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6764782" data-originallang="en">Colleagues, when we meet on Thursday, we will have Romy Bowers as the only witness. She has asked that she be afforded some flexibility with respect to her opening statement. It presently runs about eight minutes long. Is there any objection to giving her eight or nine minutes for her opening statement? If there is, we'll tell her that she has to cut it down. Is there any problem with that?</p>
<p data-HoCid="6764783" data-originallang="en">Very well. If that's the case, that concludes the business for today. Do we have consent to...?</p>
<p data-HoCid="6764784" data-originallang="en">Ms. Dancho, go ahead.</p>
