<p data-HoCid="8679184" data-originallang="en">I think we need to recognize, when we're talking about a two-state solution, that the illegal occupation of the West Bank, the ongoing settlement activity and the settler violence are intended to undermine the prospects of a two-state solution in and of itself. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679185" data-originallang="en">When we talk about the different elements that make a state a state, including controlling territory, etc., if another state—in this instance, the Government of Israel—is intentionally seeking to ruin the chances that the Palestinian people have control over their own territory, they are literally engaged in the direct undermining of the two-state solution, which makes it appear less possible. Again, I think that's dangerous and duplicitous, and we see the ongoing, everyday violence that people in the West Bank experience.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679186" data-originallang="en"> I think it's important for the committee to know that, yes, we see the bombs and the missiles, but we also see people who just want to pick olives every now and then, who are targeted for picking olives when it's time to harvest them. They are shot and moved off their land. We see ministers openly declare that those people are right and that they would like to hand them guns so that they can commit their settler violence more easily. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679187" data-originallang="en">Now we see the possible expansion of settlements to Gaza. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679188" data-originallang="en">This is all open. No one is hiding these things. It's all available to us right now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679189" data-originallang="en"> I think recognition is important as a right of the Palestinians, but it also sends an important signal that West Bank land is Palestinian land and is in line with international law and the most recent decisions of the International Court of Justice on the subject.</p>
