<p data-HoCid="8451224" data-originallang="fr">I'd like to thank Mr. Champoux for his suggestion, which I agree with.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8451225" data-originallang="fr">That said, if Ms. Ashton actually wants us to adopt her motion today, I'm prepared to work together to find a solution, which may be to say that the committee needs to see the report.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8451226" data-originallang="en">If we want to pass a motion, I am happy for us to pass a motion that says that the minister should appear, as the motion is drafted, but adding the caveat that the minister appear once the report has been made public and/or presented is the key here. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8451227" data-originallang="en">If withdrawing the motion and re-presenting is not an option, then perhaps the motion should say everything that's been said, because I think we all absolutely agree that the rise in anti-Semitism, the rise in Islamophobia and the rise in anti-Palestinian racism are all things we have to address in the report. I'm assuming the strategy addresses all of that or will speak to it. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8451228" data-originallang="en">We should have the opportunity to review the report before the minister comes. If the desire is to have a motion—and I think we all support that idea—let's at least ensure that the document we're talking about is something that we've seen. I think that seems like a reasonable thing to say. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8451229" data-originallang="en">We have two options. Do we pass a motion that says that once the report is presented, we expect the minister to show up, or, as Mr. Champoux suggested, do we pull it and bring it back when the strategy is made public?</p>
