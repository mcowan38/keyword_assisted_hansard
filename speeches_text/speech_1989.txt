<p data-HoCid="7473687" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, two days ago, Liberal members of Parliament and the <a data-HoCid="271245" href="/politicians/omar-alghabra/" title="Omar Alghabra">Minister of Transport</a> welcomed a dangerous anti-Semite, Holocaust denier and terrorist sympathizer to this place. Nazih Khatatba and Meshwar Media, which the government already gave tax dollars to, has referred to the Holocaust as a “Holohoax” and “the biggest lie in history”. This newspaper called Judaism a terrorist religion. Worse yet, this man praised last week's heinous murder of 16-year-old Canadian teenager by terrorists.</p>
