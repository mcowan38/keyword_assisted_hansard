<p data-HoCid="7928126" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7928127" data-originallang="en">I think we can all agree that what happened here on Friday was deeply hurtful. My point of order is actually that, as a Jewish Canadian, I have been very much hurt by what I have been hearing and seeing. When the <a data-HoCid="300009" href="/politicians/karina-gould/" title="Karina Gould">government House leader</a> was mentioning that she was the descendent of Holocaust survivors, the member for <a data-HoCid="278208" href="/politicians/leslyn-lewis/" title="Leslyn Lewis">Haldimandâ€”Norfolk</a> said that the chickens have come home to roost. As a Jewish Canadian, that is so deeply hurtful to hear in this context. I would ask that she apologize, because it added to the pain we are feeling.</p>
