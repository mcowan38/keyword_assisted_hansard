<p data-HoCid="6209740" data-originallang="en"> Thanks very much. I'll field that one. I appreciate the question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6209741" data-originallang="en">I'd say, first and foremost, that for the two projects you mentioned with the WHO and UNICEF, there are very specific and stringent conditions on that funding and a series of measures that we have put in place to ensure that there is no misuse or diversion of it in the field.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6209742" data-originallang="en">The first point is that these projects are being implemented directly by UNICEF and by WHO, and there are not sub-implementing partners involved. So UNICEF and the WHO are are directly responsible for the COVID implementation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6209743" data-originallang="en">Second, for our projects, we have what is called “enhanced due diligence”, which includes a series of measures designed to prevent this misuse or diversion. It starts with very specific anti-terrorism provisions in our grant arrangements. It also includes detailed screening of individuals. On the ground there is very extensive monitoring and site visits. An oversight system is put in place, and we follow that up with detailed audit and evaluation measures so that we can be assured, as you have described, that the funds are used for the purposes they have been designed for, so there is very particular care of the programming taking place in West Bank and Gaza.</p>
