<p data-HoCid="8396718" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Thank you to the officials for remaining today and answering our questions. It's useful.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8396719" data-originallang="en">I'll comment very quickly on a question that my colleague, Mr. Bergeron, asked with regard to ODA. It's at 0.38%, which is about half of what we have committed to. I was a bit shocked to hear the officials mention that we have not committed to 0.7%. I think we all know that it was, in fact, Prime Minister Pearson who actually put that 0.7% benchmark in place. Many of our allies meet and exceed that amount, so to hear the minister talk about the importance of international development while continuing to underfund international development from Canada is worrying, and particularly so when we see that the Conservative leader has said that, if he was to make government, he would cut international development spending.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8396720" data-originallang="en">This is not Canada being back on the world stage. This is not where we should be. We should be much more ambitious in our goals with regard to international development.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8396721" data-originallang="en">In the questions I have to start with today, first of all I'd like to request something. Could you please share with the committee, in writing, the legal evaluations your department has conducted over the war in Gaza, including legal advice you have received regarding the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice and arms sales, please. That's the first request I have for you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8396722" data-originallang="en">The second one is with regard to humanitarian access. Right now we know there are incredible conflicts happening in Sudan, in Haiti, in the DRC, in Ethiopia, and of course in Gaza and Ukraine. We want to understand, or I would like to understand, what your government is doing to better ensure humanitarian access to some of these very challenging places to work. In particular, what is the government doing to ensure the safety of humanitarian workers in these places?</p>
