<p data-HoCid="8124835" data-originallang="en"> Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8124836" data-originallang="en">I would like to also ask some questions following up on Mr. Chong's question and Mr. Bergeron's question. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8124837" data-originallang="en">As you've made very clear, you're unable to provide or declare whether or not something has been a war crime or a crime against humanity. Certainly, what we saw the terrorist group Hamas do is, in my opinion, very clearly that, but I understand the legal standards. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8124838" data-originallang="en">However, if the government is unable to make that assessment, it does feel very much like the Government of Canada is playing a spoiler with regard to the International Criminal Court. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8124839" data-originallang="en">My question is this: Does the government continue to oppose the International Criminal Court's investigation into the situation in Palestine, and if so, on what basis?</p>
