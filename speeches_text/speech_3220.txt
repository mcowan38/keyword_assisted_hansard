<p data-HoCid="8074476" data-originallang="en"> <em> Uqaqtittiji</em>, I am rising on a point of order based on what the <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">Conservative leader</a> said today during question period regarding first peoples. He used a possessive term that means indigenous peoples belong to another nation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8074477" data-originallang="en">I need to remind the House that first nations, Inuit and Métis are not owned by governments and that this Parliament needs to make sure it is educating Canadians that we are not owned by governments. There were children in the House when he made that statement. We need to remind Canadians that first nations, Métis and Inuit are first peoples and are not owned by anyone, especially the Conservatives. We need to also remind the Conservatives that when my colleague, the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>, was making her intervention about genocide, Conservatives were laughing at her about her terms, her statement about genocide in the House.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8074478" data-originallang="en">This Conservative Party needs to be reminded to respect first nations, Métis and Inuit.</p>
