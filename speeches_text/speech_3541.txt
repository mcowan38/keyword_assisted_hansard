<p data-HoCid="8210476" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her advocacy. I know she reached out to the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="MÃ©lanie Joly">minister</a> about this case yesterday, and other MPs have reached out to me personally about this case. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8210477" data-originallang="en">We are in constant contact with our consular officials in the region. We are also in contact with the relevant countries and with COGAT, which is the body that is in charge of whether people can leave. We are deeply troubled when we hear stories of these Canadians who are unable to leave Gaza. We will continue our advocacy and we will not stop until we get all Canadians home. </p>
