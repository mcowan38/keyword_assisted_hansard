<p data-HoCid="8386269" data-originallang="en"> I'm going to start by simply saying that I agree with Ms. Thomas's motion. I believe that anti-Semitism is a very important issue and I regret that we weren't able to discuss that motion today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8386270" data-originallang="en">I will now turn to Mr. McKinnon, because the Court Challenges Program is absolutely one of the most fundamentally important programs that exist in this country. I think it helps minority language groups, including francophones outside Quebec, English speakers inside Quebec, racial minority groups and others seeking equality rights. It's absolutely fundamental. I congratulate Mr. McKinnon on bringing forward this very important bill.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8386271" data-originallang="en">Mr. McKinnon, do you want to go through the reasons that you think it's important to legislate that only the House of Commons, by a vote, can remove the Court Challenges Program, versus simply allowing governments to arbitrarily do so? What in the history of the Court Challenges Program has led you to this conclusion? </p>
