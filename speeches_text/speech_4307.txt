<p data-HoCid="8412248" data-originallang="en">It likely will culminate in an amendment. I do want to put down the context. This is extremely important, and I will not back off from talking about the importance of anti-Semitism. I certainly hope no one here would get in the way of my talking about the important fight against anti-Semitism. That would be wrong. Quite frankly, members of your caucus have told me that they would be very disappointed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412249" data-originallang="en"> The fight against anti-Semitism continues on here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412250" data-originallang="en"> Police-reported hate crime data indicates that there were 608 hate crimes targeting religion as of May 2021. Of that number, 296 were incidents targeting the Jewish people.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412251" data-originallang="en">I want to be clear: Whether you're targeting a Sikh, a Muslim or a Jew, an attack on one faith is an attack on all Canadians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412252" data-originallang="en">Of those incidents, 296 were targeting the Jewish population. That represented a decrease from incidents in 2018, so, as I said, progress was being made. Unfortunately in recent months it's been rough. It's been harsh for folks of the Jewish faith.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412253" data-originallang="en">I would actually, at this point, like to propose my amendment. I will propose two amendments here.</p>
