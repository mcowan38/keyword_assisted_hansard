<p data-HoCid="8337138" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8337139" data-originallang="en">Thank you all very much for coming here today. It's an important study. We have decided that we would be studying this for several meetings, so I am going to take my time right now to read a motion that I'd like to make sure is on the record, mostly because we have a number of meetings to discuss this. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8337140" data-originallang="en">Unfortunately, with my limited time, I do need to mention something that's quite pressing. To start, I want to say that despite my motion to study the situation in Israel and Palestine at this committee, which passed in a vote last May, nearly a year ago, that study has not been scheduled by this committee, to the great frustration of the New Democratic Party. The situation in Israel and Palestine should also be a priority of this committee, as it is for foreign affairs committees in other parts of the world. However, I am feeling that our efforts here are consistently being blocked.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8337141" data-originallang="en">I will use the remainder of my time to give notice of a new motion that addresses the government's failure to provide the documents that this committee requested back in February. I have been trying for weeks to get this committee to agree to make the few documents we received public, and to return to Global Affairs Canada with instructions to provide the rest of the documents.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8337142" data-originallang="en">In addition, I am frustrated that on March 18, the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> promised us that she would issue a notice to exporters regarding arms exports to Israel, but this has not yet been done. I don't understand the lack of urgency, when 13,000 children have been killed and more people are starving to death every day.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8337143" data-originallang="en">Here is the motion that I am giving notice of today:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8337144" data-originallang="en"> That, given the failure of Global Affairs Canada to produce the documents requested by this committee on February 12, 2024, and the letter to the committee from the Deputy Minister dated March 13, 2024, requesting further instruction, the chair instruct the clerk to publish the letter and annex received from Global Affairs Canada on Canada’s arms exports to Israel on the public committee web page; that the committee instruct Global Affairs Canada to: a) provide details on all current open export and brokering permits for military goods and technology to Israel, without redaction for commercial confidentiality, as the Committee requested in its motion of February 12 2024; b) provide details on all export or brokering permits for military goods and technology to Israel, whether open or expired, dating back to 2020, not 2006 as the Committee requested in its motion of February 12 2024; c) reissue the annex without redactions for commercial confidentiality, as the committee motion specified; That these details be provided within 30 days of adoption of this motion; and, That, once received, these documents be made public on the committee website. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8337145" data-originallang="en">With that, I will ensure that the clerk is given copies of this motion in both English and French.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8337146" data-originallang="en">I would now like to turn to our witnesses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8337147" data-originallang="en">I thank you for your patience as I brought that forward. It is very important to me that we are able to get the documents that so many organizations across Canada have been wanting.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8337148" data-originallang="en">What I will start with is some of the information that you provided, Major-General, on peacekeeping. In 2016, we know that this government had committed to 600 military peacekeepers and 150 military police who would be allocated as peacekeepers around the world. How many peacekeepers have been allocated to the continent of Africa?</p>
