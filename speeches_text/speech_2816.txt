<p data-HoCid="7988489" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988490" data-originallang="en">You've sensed from a lot of questions from committee members here today that clearly Canadians were rightly shocked and shaken by the terrorist attack on October 7 that attacked civilians in Israel. There was consensus by Canadians to stand in solidarity with those who were impacted and with Israel and those who suffered by or from that attack.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988491" data-originallang="en">Now, within a couple of weeks, moving on, Canadians are also horrified by the magnitude of the civilian damage that has taken place in Gaza. You referred repeatedly to the rules of war and international law. I understand that you or Canadian officials from Canada are unable to determine what violations, if any, have occurred. Who is the arbiter? Who is the referee when international law is being violated? </p>
