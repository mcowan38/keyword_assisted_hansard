<p data-HoCid="8702979" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8702980" data-originallang="fr">I'd like to mention at the outset that I had the opportunity to visit Israel and Palestine a few times, including as a parliamentarian. For a Quebecker and a democrat to witness what is happening in the West Bank is an upsetting experience. We're talking about military occupation, checkpoints, daily humiliation and children being arrested by soldiers and tried in military courts.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8702981" data-originallang="fr">I'm also thinking of the arrogance of extremist settlers, particularly in Hebron, the theft of land and the destruction of villages, farms, olive trees and herds, at times. I returned from there with the image of a military boot crushing a human face. It's not a good feeling. I think we need to take action, as a country, to change this situation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8702982" data-originallang="fr">Ms. Kowalski, what do you think of what's happening in the West Bank, which has been occupied for about a year, and settler violence? Do you think the Netanyahu government is using the war in Gaza in part to accelerate the West Bank annexation?</p>
