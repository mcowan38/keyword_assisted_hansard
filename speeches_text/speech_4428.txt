<p data-HoCid="8454147" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8454148" data-originallang="en">I would just like to put on the record that as we are talking about the crossing at Rafah, it's really important to mention that today the news is that there is burning everywhere. Gazans are under fire. They're burning. They're dying. There are babies beheaded. The images are horrendous. I don't wish this upon anyone. I would hope that, in the right conscience, if the minister had to save a life, he would choose to save a life versus using some legal jargon that we are talking about here today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8454149" data-originallang="en">Minister, you increased the cap from 1,000 to 5,000 today. Can you talk about whether this cap is per application or per person?</p>
