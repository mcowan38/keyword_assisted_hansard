<p data-HoCid="6169383" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I enjoy serving with my friend on the Canada-China special committee. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6169384" data-originallang="en">I just want to respond to some of the things he said, and maybe he can then respond to that. He raised the issue of the situation in Israel and the Palestinians. That would be a very interesting subject for an opposition day motion from the Bloc, if and when the Bloc is able to have that opportunity. It is an important issue. I will not try to get into my views on that subject, because I would like to have at least five to 10 minutes to do so. It is an important issue for discussion, perhaps in a different context.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6169385" data-originallang="en">The member is not sure about our motives. I think my motives are very pure. However, at the end of the day, he does not have to vote on my motives; he just has to vote on what is in the motion. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6169386" data-originallang="en">The critical piece of this amendment that is unique is that it would actually allow the committee to meet digitally. Right now, the Canada-China special committee might wish to meet, but it cannot meet because it does not have the special permission to meet through video conference. Therefore, if the members support this amendment, they will be empowering the committee to undertake its important work but to do so using video conferencing. If the member thinks the committee should be able to get back to work and meet remotely, given how critical the Canada-China relationship is in the midst of all the things that are going on, then I suggest he support the amendment to allow that to happen.</p>
