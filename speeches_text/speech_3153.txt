<p data-HoCid="8098604" data-originallang="en">I think some of Canada's allies appreciate its positions on different international legal matters. I can say that, in my discussions with member states of the International Criminal Court—many, if not all, are allies of Canada—there is a concern. They fail to understand why Canada would not support the International Criminal Court's investigations into Palestine. Not only that, Canada seems to want to obstruct those investigations. As I said earlier, it's one thing to stand aside and another to obstruct and continuously declare that Palestine isn't a state before the ICC, when in fact the judges at the International Criminal Court have found exactly the opposite. In my view, it does not help the credibility of Canada in various fora at the United Nations and in most of its diplomatic engagements.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098605" data-originallang="en">Again, I think people are surprised and taken aback. They are trying to figure out how this rhetoric on defending a rules-based order and international justice fits with such selective approaches—not to abstract beings, but to people who are experiencing atrocities and who have been experiencing atrocities for a very long time.</p>
