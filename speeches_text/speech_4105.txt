<p data-HoCid="8396725" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8396726" data-originallang="en">I would press the government to continue to do this important work because, of course, the challenge is that you will have to be nimble. You will have to be able to work with non-traditional partners to be able to provide the urgently needed humanitarian access in many of these conflicts. Honestly, we don't have some of those relationships right now, and the government needs to do that work much better.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8396727" data-originallang="en">I also wanted to ask: With the expected end of the Middle East strategy, is there a new Middle East strategy in development to respond to the changing situations that we see in the region? We know that the original strategy was a response to the Syrian crisis and to other crises in the area. This all looks very different now. The needs are massive. The crises continue to build and grow.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8396728" data-originallang="en">Is there consideration of a broader strategy that would encompass the foreseen changes, including in Israel, Palestine, Lebanon and other countries, knowing that the current strategy ends in 2025?</p>
