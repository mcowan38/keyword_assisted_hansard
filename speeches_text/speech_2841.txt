<p data-HoCid="7964051" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the war between Hamas and Israel keeps taking the lives of so many innocent Israelis and Palestinians. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is getting worse by the minute. People in Gaza have very little access to water, food or electricity. They are forced to flee their homes or be bombed, and half of them are children. Palestinians and Israelis deserve to live in peace, and that is why the NDP has been calling for an immediate ceasefire and for the release of the hostages.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7964052" data-originallang="en">Why will the government not do everything in its power to save lives by calling for a ceasefire?</p>
