<p data-HoCid="8575667" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, tomorrow night is the beginning of the Jewish new year. Normally, this is a festive time, one of joy and celebration. However, this year there is a shadow. The last year has been an annus horribilis for Jews.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8575668" data-originallang="en">Next week is the anniversary of October 7, a day Hamas attacked Israel, slaughtered over 1,200 people and kidnapped hundreds of others. Then a wave of anti-Semitism swept across the world, people here at home telling Jews to go back to Poland, firing shots into our schools, yelling hateful slogans outside our community buildings, setting up encampments on university campuses and attacking our support for Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8575669" data-originallang="en">I pray this new year is a better one. I pray for a world where Israel can defend itself from Iranian and Hezbollah missiles without being condemned, and one where it can live securely in peace with its neighbours. I pray for a Canada where Jewish Canadians can feel safe again, as all governments take real action to confront anti-Semitism.</p>
