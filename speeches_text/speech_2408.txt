<p data-HoCid="7797335" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7797336" data-originallang="en">I want to begin with a few comments. Then, I will let the committee know that I will be introducing a first amendment to be considered, after which I will have a second amendment. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7797337" data-originallang="en">I will begin by saying that Canada is a steadfast ally and friend of Israel and a friend of the Palestinian people. I think our position as Canada and the Canadian government is long-standing and has been clear. It has been the position of successive governments. We are committed to the goal of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East, including the creation of a Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7797338" data-originallang="en">We recognize Israel's right to assure its own security and to protect its citizens from attacks by terrorist groups in accordance with humanitarian rights and international humanitarian law, and we recognize the Palestinian right to self-determination. Canada also believes in upholding the rule of law and democracy and in defending the institutions that underpin them. We strongly oppose any unilateral actions that undermine the rule of law and jeopardize international efforts towards lasting peace, and support all efforts towards a two-state solution. We will always support the Israeli and Palestinian peoples in their right to live in peace and security with dignity and without fear.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7797339" data-originallang="en">We agree that a study of the region could be a constructive way to evaluate this work, discuss best practices with civil society partners and assess areas through which we can further collaborate to address issues on the ground. However, in order to be productive, the study must be fact-based and conducted without bias or any prejudged conclusions. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7797340" data-originallang="en">As such, the NDP resolution right now, as it has been drafted and as it is being framed publicly, while very well-intentioned, we don't believe sets the stage for such a study. Therefore, we will put forward a couple of amendments to help us move this issue forward in the spirit of co-operation and collaboration, with the shared goal in mind of best supporting Israeli and Palestinian peoples.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7797341" data-originallang="en">That being said, I would move my first amendment. The first line of the motion begins as follows: “That, pursuant to Standing Order 108(2), and in light of recent events in Israel and Palestine, the committee”. I would replace “Israel and Palestine” with “Israel, the West Bank and Gaza”. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7797342" data-originallang="en">We think that statement would better represent Canada's position, long held by successive governments, on our understanding of the area as being Israel, the West Bank and Gaza.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7797343" data-originallang="en">That would be my first amendment.</p>
