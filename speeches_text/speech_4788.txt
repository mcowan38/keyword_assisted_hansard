<p data-HoCid="8552424" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, there has been too much suffering from Hamas's horrific attacks on October 7 to the heartbreaking catastrophe in Gaza. It has to end. We call for an immediate ceasefire, for the release of all hostages, for an urgent increase in humanitarian assistance in Gaza and for Palestinian civilians to be protected. We need to return to a path to peace based on a two-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side in peace and security.</p>
