<p data-HoCid="7971257" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the world is a dangerous place for women. In the DRC, women are facing the world's highest rates of sexual and gender-based violence. MSF reports that sexual violence now is a public health emergency in the Central African Republic. In Afghanistan and Iran, women's rights are non-existent.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7971258" data-originallang="en"> In Canada, women who speak up are attacked, not just in politics but also in journalism, on social media and in their communities. I am alarmed by the exclusion of Muslim and Jewish women's voices from critical conversations on Israel and Palestine. Canada claims to have a feminist foreign policy, but where are the investments? As Sudan's Hala Al-Karib said recently, only paying lip service to the women, peace and security agenda without insisting on women's rights and women's meaningful participation in peace and political processes is not enough.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7971259" data-originallang="en"> Canada must do better.</p>
