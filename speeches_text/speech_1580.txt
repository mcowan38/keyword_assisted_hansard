<p data-HoCid="7031132" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, one of the most common threads we heard throughout the testimony from experts on Bill <a data-HoCid="11488354" href="/bills/44-1/C-7/">C-7</a> was that there was a need for national conscience rights.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7031133" data-originallang="en">The committee heard from patients rights groups, lawyers, disabilities rights experts, medical ethicists, indigenous leaders, imams, rabbis and priests, as well as individuals who provided testimony of their own personal experiences, which are very different than the one that the member spoke to.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7031134" data-originallang="en">I have also received emails from physicians from across the country who are deeply concerned about their ability to continue practising as a result of, and from those who have experienced, intimidation and coercion to participate in the provision of MAID.</p>
