<p data-HoCid="7988163" data-originallang="en">Welcome to meeting number 77 of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988164" data-originallang="en">Today's meeting is being held in public and is taking place in a hybrid format pursuant to the Standing Orders. Therefore, members are attending in person in the room and remotely by using the Zoom application.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988165" data-originallang="en">I would like to make a few comments for the benefit of members and witnesses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988166" data-originallang="en">Before speaking, please wait until I recognize you by name. For those participating by video conference, click on the microphone icon to activate your mike, and please do mute yourselves when you are not speaking. For those in the room, your microphone will be controlled by the proceedings and verification officer. You may speak in the official language of your choice.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988167" data-originallang="en">Although this room is equipped with a powerful audio system, feedback events can occur. These can be extremely harmful to interpreters and cause serious injuries. The most common cause of sound feedback is an earpiece worn too close to a microphone.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988168" data-originallang="en"> I will remind you that all comments should be addressed through the chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988169" data-originallang="en"> With regard to a speaking list, the committee clerk and I will do the very best we possibly can to maintain a consolidated order of speaking for all members, whether they are participating virtually or in person. </p>
