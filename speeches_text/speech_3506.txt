<p data-HoCid="8233384" data-originallang="en">Two minutes is very short, so I'm going to ask two really hard questions and then wish you luck.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8233385" data-originallang="en">The first question is about our arms sales and what it says about our diplomatic relationships with other countries when we prioritize arms to Turkey, Israel, India and Saudi Arabia versus looking at our responsibilities under the ATT, the Arms Trade Treaty, and human rights requirements. </p>

<p data-HoCid="8233387" data-originallang="en">Ms. Deif, I'll start with you.</p>
