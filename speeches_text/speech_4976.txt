<p data-HoCid="8594880" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, one year ago, the Jewish people were savagely attacked in the deadliest act of sadistic barbarism since the Holocaust. Over 1,200 souls were raped, murdered and taken hostage by a radical death cult backed by the clerical regime in Tehran, seven Canadians among them. Today, 101 remain in the grips of terrorists hidden in the tunnels of hell.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8594881" data-originallang="en"> One year ago, the glory of living a peaceful and safe existence in this country as a Jew ended. They have placated the mob of woke radicals and the anti-Zionist Jew haters that reign free in our streets and reward terror. We used to be a country that was clear and unequivocal about eradicating anti-Semitism here and destroying terrorists, without conditions, everywhere.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8594882" data-originallang="en"> For those who remain captive, those waiting for their loved ones to come home, those who never made it back, we remember them. For those horrified at the state of our country, we will fight to restore the Canada we know and love, even when they will not. </p>
