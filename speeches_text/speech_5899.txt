<p data-HoCid="8813284" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Johns, first of all, on Gaza, insofar as you're asking me a question about forcible displacement, I don't believe anybody should be forcibly displaced from Gaza. I think Gaza's territorial integrity should be respected, and that's the position of the Government of Canada, which has been very clearly expressed by our <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> and by our minister. As to the rest of your comments at the beginning, that's your opinion. I'm giving you the position of the Government of Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8813285" data-originallang="en">On Syria, to be serious for a moment, I think there's a very difficult decision people have to make, because we don't quite know what the situation isâ€”how stable it is and how much security there's going to be. Everyone, whether living in Canada or living in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan or Syria, who is internally displaced is wondering if it's safe for them to go back home to Aleppo or another city that's been liberated. I think these are questions the Syrians themselves will have to decide.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8813286" data-originallang="en">We're doing everything we can to reinforce the security of Syria. We're doing everything we can to support the humanitarian agencies. I was talking yesterday to Mr. Fletcher, the new executive director of OCHA, which is the UN humanitarian agency. We had a very good conversation about this very question. I know our own government is looking all the time at assessing this as best we can, because we don't have our embassy in Damascus. We quite rightly pulled out of our embassy because of Assad, but we have terrific teams that are working in all of the neighbouring countries. They're working hard to give us the best possible information about the safety and security of the people in Syria.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8813287" data-originallang="en">I know that every family will be thinking about what they will do and how they are going to do it. I know that the Government of Canada will be reflecting on the ways we can provide the most accurate information and the ways we can provide all the assistance, humanitarian and otherwise, that, frankly, we've been providing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8813288" data-originallang="en">We have done a fantastic job on behalf of civilians in Syria over the last 10 years. I've been very proud to see the efforts we've made. They've been extraordinary. I think they're widely appreciated by civil society groups in Syria, which are celebrating the end of the Assad government, a brutal dictatorship, but we have to figure out what is coming and what the political path is going forward. That will be a decision the Syrian people themselves will have to make.</p>
