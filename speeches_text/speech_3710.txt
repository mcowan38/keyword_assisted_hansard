<p data-HoCid="8292878" data-originallang="en"> I appreciate the witnesses today. I know this is a difficult topic, but it's one that you're both working on. I appreciate you both so much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8292879" data-originallang="en">I'm going to start with Ms. Varley. I want to talk a bit about the structural factors that we need to address alongside the red dress alert.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8292880" data-originallang="en"> My colleague from the NDP, <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Leah Gazan</a>, when she brought this motion forward and wanted to do this study, recognized that there are decades of insufficient action from all levels of government that have failed to address the effects of the residential school genocide.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8292881" data-originallang="en"> I would really like to hear from you about some of those structural factors that we need to address in government, and even in policing, that I heard today. What are those structural things that we can do alongside the alert that's needed and is working, as Ms. Jesty mentioned, in her community?</p>
