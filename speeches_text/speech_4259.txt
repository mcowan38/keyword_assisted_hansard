<p data-HoCid="8435051" data-originallang="en"> I'll mention just a few and pass to my colleagues.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435052" data-originallang="en"> First of all, we really appreciate all of the good support in the budget. It's excellent. It really was wind in our sails, particularly with regard to law enforcement, money for training and the work that CRRF is doing in terms of delivering training, but it has to be specific to anti-Semitism and it has to incorporate the IHRA definition. That is critical, and this committee should make that one of its recommendations, please. It's critical that we have that. The money to be well spent must incorporate the IHRA definition and training.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435053" data-originallang="en">Second, as important an issue as it is, we have special prosecutors for auto theft. We have no special prosecutors for anti-Semitism or with a focus on hate crimes. I think this is a recommendation. Although I know it's provincial jurisdiction, it is necessary. I'll leave those two with you.</p>
