<p data-HoCid="7105186" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, this evening is Yom HaShoah, a time to remember the Holocaust. It is when it commences. This weekend at the National War Memorial, a memorial that is committed to remembering Canadian soldiers who gave their lives to fight the Holocaust, there is going to be a protest where the chief guest speaker is a notorious anti-Semite and a Holocaust denier and someone who is promoting the horrific war in Ukraine that Putin is engaged in.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7105187" data-originallang="en">Canadians deserve to be protected from hate groups, so what is the government going to do to prevent this obscenity from happening?</p>
