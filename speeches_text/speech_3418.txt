<p data-HoCid="8199129" data-originallang="en">I think Canada has an increasingly challenged relationship in not having a principled approach to many issues. This is not so much related to the United States as it is a track record over the past 15 years. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8199130" data-originallang="en">You mentioned the conflict in Gaza. That is an example. What is our principled position on Gaza? This creates challenges in how developing countries see Canada as an independent thinker on issues. We've moved away from a position where we are an honest broker between the United States and other countries. We need to move back to that principled approach, one where we chart out a Canadian path, not a path that is necessarily always aligned with the United States. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8199131" data-originallang="en">However, let's be clear. We are aligned with the United States on many issues because we share an economy. We have many shared cultural issues. We have respect for the rule of law. As a result, I think we will naturally be aligned with the United States on more issues than not.</p>
