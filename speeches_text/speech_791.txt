<p data-HoCid="6572887" data-originallang="en">Even the Trump administration highlighted a lot of flaws with the processâ€”things that were being neglected and ignored that need to be addressed. I assume that under the Biden administration we will still see the same things being brought forth and we'll have to address them. I think they need to be addressed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6572888" data-originallang="en">While we are addressing those issues, I am wondering if we should also be addressing some of the other issues, such as enforcement, as I mentioned. What used to bug me with COOL was that anything we did to retaliate also hurt the Canadian sectors, which would be retaliated against. I would almost like to be able to retaliate by exporting to Japan or somewhere else, so at least it wouldn't hurt us but would hurt somebody else. That's a different world.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6572889" data-originallang="en">Mr. Kennedy, I was going to ask you a question. Right now, with COVID, one of the things I'm hearing from the CEOs of my small businesses is that they're trying to plan for the summer. They're trying to figure out what they're going to do. I'm very concerned, as we see other countries like Israel and the U.S. being so far ahead of us in vaccinations, that they'll actually have their economies jump-started before we will, and then they could come in and scoop up our customers.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6572890" data-originallang="en">How big a threat is that?</p>
