<p data-HoCid="8220323" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair, for allowing me to speak.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8220324" data-originallang="en">I support this motion, and I'm happy that we are able to do something about this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8220325" data-originallang="en">Since this crisis in Gaza started on October 7, I have had numerous meetings with families and people who have families stuck in this crisis. They are pleading with us to get them out of Gaza. The atrocities happening there are unimaginable for us as Canadians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8220326" data-originallang="en">As Canada has been a beacon for many nations through conflicts and war, I think we should step up and help the people stuck in Gaza and Sudan. The atrocities happening are terrible things. The images we see on social media and in the news really break my heart when I see them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8220327" data-originallang="en">Since October 7, I have had numerous meetings with leaders from the communities in my riding. I have two large mosques in my riding, and the leaders from both mosques have been to my office. We have had numerous meetings in regard to this and how we as the government and a country can help bring refugees and people in crisis out of Gaza and Sudan.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8220328" data-originallang="en">I'm fully in support of this motion, and I hope we can move ahead and help the people who are in dire need in the Middle East and Sudan. I'm hoping to work with my colleagues across the aisle to ensure that we can expedite this, with all parties working together.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8220329" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair, for allowing me to speak.</p>
