<p data-HoCid="7105517" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I want to thank the member for <a data-HoCid="278477" href="/politicians/kevin-waugh/" title="Kevin Waugh">Saskatoon—Grasswood</a> for his perseverance in bringing this important piece of legislation before the House. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7105518" data-originallang="en">I hope he will indulge me for just a moment. At the age of 19, as a student on a summer program in Europe, I visited Mauthausen, one of the concentration camps. I came away from that visit thinking either the site should be plowed up and planted with flowers or that every young person should be required to visit. I could not make up my mind.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7105519" data-originallang="en"> I stand here, 50 years later, still unable to make up my mind, but I believe that the member for <a data-HoCid="278477" href="/politicians/kevin-waugh/" title="Kevin Waugh">Saskatoon—Grasswood</a> has convinced me that Holocaust denial is an important tool in inciting violence and hatred against the Jewish community and therefore it deserves criminalization. I know that he will agree with me when I say that it would make a great difference in combatting the rise in anti-Semitism that B'nai B'rith has documented again this year in its audit.</p>
