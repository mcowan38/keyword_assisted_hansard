<p data-HoCid="7974272" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I am very disappointed that Conservatives did not support my bill, Bill <a data-HoCid="11541161" href="/bills/44-1/C-245/" title="An Act to amend the Canada Infrastructure Bank Act">C-245</a>, which sought to transform the Infrastructure Bank in such a way that it could make a difference in the lives of Canadians, when it comes to the major infrastructure needs in our communities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7974273" data-originallang="en"> It is not a bad thing to have a Crown corporation that is committed to building desperately needed infrastructure in our country, particularly as we face the climate crisis. We know that our infrastructure needs are significant on various fronts, but we also know that we are particularly deficient when it comes to climate-resilient infrastructure and ensuring our communities have the kind of infrastructure they need to face the climate crisis.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7974274" data-originallang="en">I want to acknowledge that the Bloc supported our bill at second reading, and I am thankful for that support, as well as that of the Green MPs. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7974275" data-originallang="en">The reality is that, in ditching Bill <a data-HoCid="11541161" href="/bills/44-1/C-245/" title="An Act to amend the Canada Infrastructure Bank Act">C-245</a>, Canada missed an opportunity to transform a Crown corporation, an infrastructure bank, in such a way that it could meet the needs of our communities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7974276" data-originallang="en"> My bill was rooted in the experience of communities like the ones I represent, communities that are on the front lines of the climate crisis and are facing record wildfires and flooding. Communities such as the first nations on the east side of Lake Winnipeg do not have all-weather road access. They have to rely on ice roads for shorter periods of time to access medical services, shop more affordably and bring in the materials they need to build the homes they desperately require and other necessary infrastructure. I have heard time and again from first nations and northern leaders. As a northerner myself, it is clear to me that the infrastructure gap in regions like ours is only getting worse. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7974277" data-originallang="en">In talking about Bill <a data-HoCid="11541161" href="/bills/44-1/C-245/" title="An Act to amend the Canada Infrastructure Bank Act">C-245</a>, I heard stories from first nations. One first nation was refused funding to upgrade a community home that was in desperate need of fixing because it could not show Canada's Infrastructure Bank how it was profitable. A northern community that was trying to switch from diesel fuel was told to apply for solar panel funding in the middle of winter. There are serious concerns from indigenous leaders that Indigenous Services Canada may help out once things are really and truly broken, but not a moment before.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7974278" data-originallang="en">Prior to Bill <a data-HoCid="11541161" href="/bills/44-1/C-245/" title="An Act to amend the Canada Infrastructure Bank Act">C-245</a> coming to the House at second reading, I acknowledged at the time that communities in my riding were facing immense challenges, as communities were becoming isolated with the melting of the ice roads. One of the projects we talked about needing investment was an all-weather road on the east side of Lake Winnipeg, connecting a dozen first nations that right now are becoming increasingly isolated as a result of the impacts of the climate crises. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7974279" data-originallang="en">We also talked about the transfer from diesel reliance to more sustainable forms of energy. Four of the communities I represent in the far north of northern Manitoba still depend on diesel fuel. We know that many communities in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories are in the same boat. This is unnecessary, given our ability to invest in sustainable energy. That requires government involvement, and the Canada Infrastructure Bank would be well placed to be involved in this kind of work.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7974280" data-originallang="en">As the climate crisis becomes more serious, it is clear that our infrastructure is not up to snuff. It is clear that our communities desperately need a partner in the federal government to invest in the infrastructure we need. Currently, we know that Indigenous Services Canada is not meeting the needs, by a longshot, of indigenous communities when it comes to infrastructure. The housing crisis in communities, for example, is acute. There is a need for critical infrastructure, whether it is health centres, or water and sewer, or roads in the communities or roads connecting communities that currently do not exist.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7974281" data-originallang="en">Indigenous Services Canada is not meeting the needs of indigenous communities. The Canada Infrastructure Bank could play that kind of role. It is not playing that role right now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7974282" data-originallang="en">Since Bill <a data-HoCid="11541161" href="/bills/44-1/C-245/" title="An Act to amend the Canada Infrastructure Bank Act">C-245</a>, we have noticed that the Canada Infrastructure Bank has paid greater attention to the needs of northern and even indigenous communities. I want to acknowledge the work being done on the airport here in Thompson and the Canada Infrastructure Bank's involvement there. I also want to acknowledge the work of the Keewatin Tribal Council in pushing the visionary Pusiko development and hope that the infrastructure bank will be a willing partner in terms of investing in this kind of legacy project.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7974283" data-originallang="en">However, I am deeply disappointed that we are still not seeing the kind of significant investment in northern and indigenous communities or communities across the country, underscoring the work of the transport committee. What is the point of an infrastructure bank that is not making a difference to communities? On that, I want to end by saying that many of us are in Parliament because we want to better the lives of our constituents, people across our country and people around the world. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7974284" data-originallang="en">To that end, I would like to finish my speech by stating clearly that Canada must call for a ceasefire now in Israel and Gaza. Canada must be a voice for peace and justice. As the representative of UNRWA said, “History will ask why the world did not have the courage to act decisively and stop this hell on Earth.”</p>
