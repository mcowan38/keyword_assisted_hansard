<p data-HoCid="6403269" data-originallang="en">I believe so. You may have the count in front of you, Ms. Dabrusin. I think it's about that, out of my memory.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6403270" data-originallang="en">Just to add to what you said, I think the frame is that no one should question that Canada, as you said, has been a steadfast ally and is and will be a friend of Israel and a friend of the Palestinian people. Canada voted in support of this particular resolution as it addresses the core of the issue of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Canada strongly supports, as you said, the international consensus of a two-state solution so that both sides can have a secure and prosperous future.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6403271" data-originallang="en">In that, I think Canada made a principled vote. I have been in touch with Jewish communities across Canada. We have to remember that this particular resolution was to reaffirm the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. I have explained that to Jewish communities across Canada. I have been in touch with my Israeli counterpart to explain Canada's position. I think that as a friend of Israel we all want a lasting peace and we all want a two-state solution. I think we've been able to explain that, and we will continue to be the steadfast ally that we have always been.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6403272" data-originallang="en">As every member of this committee knows, overwhelmingly Canada supports Israel, not just at the United Nations, but at all international organizations. In my discussions with my counterpart, I can tell you that we have many bilateral projects that we're pursuing. We talk almost every other week or we exchange...because as I said, now you do diplomacy by text messages. We are probably as close as two ministers of foreign affairs have ever been between Canada and Israel, and it will continue. </p>
