<p data-HoCid="8197379" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I would like to start by noting that, this evening and in past debate, we have heard really clear calls for how important this bill is, in particular from our hon. colleague the member for <a data-HoCid="278704" href="/politicians/lori-idlout/" title="Lori Idlout">Nunavut</a> tonight. The member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> further made clear that case.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8197380" data-originallang="en">With the limited time that I have, the contribution I would like to make to this debate is really focused on the importance of listening to indigenous leaders, particularly with respect to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls to action.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8197381" data-originallang="en">In my view, Bill <a data-HoCid="11471427" href="/bills/44-1/C-273/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (Corinne’s Quest and the protection of children)">C-273</a> is an offer to all parliamentarians to move ahead with the TRC's calls to actions. For my part, I have committed to fully implementing them, as has the Green Party of Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8197382" data-originallang="en">I will read out, once again, call to action 6: “We call upon the Government of Canada to repeal Section 43 of the Criminal Code of Canada.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8197383" data-originallang="en"> This is exactly what Bill <a data-HoCid="11471427" href="/bills/44-1/C-273/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (Corinne’s Quest and the protection of children)">C-273</a> seeks to do.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8197384" data-originallang="en">As background, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission issued 94 calls to action back in 2015 and progress has been absurdly slow. At the current pace, the calls will not be completed until 2081, yet every party in this House of Commons has committed to fully implementing the calls.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8197385" data-originallang="en">I will summarize them now. In 2015, then-leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, now the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, said, “On behalf of the Liberal Party of Canada and our parliamentary caucus, I affirm our unwavering support for the TRC’s recommendations, and call on the Government of Canada to take immediate action to implement them.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8197386" data-originallang="en">That is being applauded by a member from the governing party. I would remind that member that call to action 6 is exactly what this bill is calling for. I certainly hope that this government will be supporting Bill <a data-HoCid="11471427" href="/bills/44-1/C-273/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (Corinne’s Quest and the protection of children)">C-273</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8197387" data-originallang="en">As for the Conservative Party, in 2021, Erin O'Toole, then-leader of the Conservative Party, pledged a plan to implement all Truth and Reconciliation calls to action. I assume that included call to action 6.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8197388" data-originallang="en">As for the Bloc Québécois, in 2021, in their platform, Bloc MPs would pressure the federal government to implement all recommendations from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8197389" data-originallang="en">In the same campaign, 2021, the <a data-HoCid="278714" href="/politicians/jagmeet-singh/" title="Jagmeet Singh">leader</a> of the NDP committed to fully implement all outstanding recommendations from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. An NDP MP, in fact, is bringing forward a bill here to work toward doing so.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8197390" data-originallang="en">The leader of the Green Party of Canada, the member for <a data-HoCid="278722" href="/politicians/elizabeth-may/" title="Elizabeth May">Saanich—Gulf Islands</a>, pledged the same thing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8197391" data-originallang="en">In short, I hope that my colleagues follow through on the commitments of their parties and those that I know they personally, I am sure, have also made.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8197392" data-originallang="en">Certainly, I hope, at the very least, that this would get to committee. This is the second time now, in my time as an MP, that I am seeing this gap between commitments to follow the TRC calls to action and opportunities that MPs have to do so.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8197393" data-originallang="en">The last time was on Bill <a data-HoCid="11482450" href="/bills/44-1/C-5/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act">C-5</a>. One of the TRC calls to action, call to action 32, is to remove mandatory minimum penalties. Of course, Bill C-5 removed some but not all of them. That was not what was in call to action 32. It was to follow through on removing all of them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8197394" data-originallang="en">Once again, though, in this vote on Bill <a data-HoCid="11471427" href="/bills/44-1/C-273/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (Corinne’s Quest and the protection of children)">C-273</a>, parliamentarians will have another opportunity. For those who have pledged to pressure the government to do so, this is now being offered. An MP has put forward a bill that would directly call to repeal section 43 of the Criminal Code. That is call to action 6.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8197395" data-originallang="en">I would hope that colleagues would support this bill and, in doing so, move us one very small step closer toward following through on all 94 calls to action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission from back in 2015. We are now in 2024. We need to move more quickly. Here is one chance to do so.</p>
