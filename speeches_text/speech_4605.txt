<p data-HoCid="8484544" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8484546" data-originallang="en">Good afternoon to my colleagues.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8484547" data-originallang="en">Thank you, witnesses, for your testimony.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8484548" data-originallang="en">I have just a few comments first. I recognize that we have a housing crisis across the country, but let's also give some credit where credit is due. I'd say that for decades we saw the federal government take a back seat on housing and on building more affordable homes across the country. We know that from 2008 to 2015, 800,000 affordable homes were lost.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8484549" data-originallang="en">In 2017, we got back into the business of housing. We came forth with the national housing strategy. That national housing strategy, which has been unfolding over the last several years, has included the co-investment program, the rapid housing initiative, the housing accelerator and the apartment loan program. There have been many federal initiatives.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8484550" data-originallang="en"> I know that my esteemed colleague across with the Conservatives talked about all the tools in the tool box and whether municipalities should have more tools in that tool box. Do you know what? I wouldn't want to be a contractor or somebody grabbing from my tool box what the Conservative Party gave me, because that tool box would be empty. There wouldn't be any tools in the tool box. They've come forth with no programs and no real suggestions except to vote against the tools that we would put in our tool box, including all the programs I just mentioned. The Conservative party voted against every one of those.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8484551" data-originallang="en">Of note, I just want to talk here about the GST removal, and I'm going to quote an article here from the CBC nationally. The headline says, “Housing starts in New Brunswick”—my home province—“lagging further behind Maritime neighbours in early 2024”. </p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8484552" data-originallang="en"> The New Brunswick government missed its target for new housing starts in 2023 by a wide margin but says it's still not interested in cutting sales taxes on new apartment builds.... </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8484553" data-originallang="en">That's despite provinces like Nova Scotia having far outpaced New Brunswick in home builds.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8484554" data-originallang="en"> I know, Mr. Wvong, that you talked about the removal of the GST. The Conservative leader's private member's bill actually would put the sales tax back on. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8484555" data-originallang="en">If you will, Mr. Wvong, talk to me about the importance of the removal of the GST in spurring new apartment builds. Also, please comment on why some provinces, including my province of New Brunswick, have failed to do that. Thank you.</p>
