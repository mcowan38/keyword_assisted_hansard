<p data-HoCid="8693691" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'll do my best.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693692" data-originallang="fr">I thank the members of the committee for having me here today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693693" data-originallang="en"> I'm honoured to share the same platform as a number of your distinguished witnesses preceding me, including people like Professor Ardi Imseis and former Canadian ambassador to Israel Jon Allen. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693694" data-originallang="en">My organization, OFIP, endorses Ambassador Allen's view as reported in the press: </p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8693695" data-originallang="en"> Recognizing a Palestinian state now is about sending a message of hope and commitment to Palestinians and sending a clear message to Israel and others that simply managing the conflict, Israel's policy for the last 17 years, is not an option and never was. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8693696" data-originallang="en">I would add that Canada's recognition of Palestinian statehood would enhance the ability of Palestinians to advance their rights internationally, supporting them as they seek representation and justice in international forums. It would send a message more broadly to the global south that Canada exercises its sovereignty by supporting international law without fear or favour, whether applied to friend or foe.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693697" data-originallang="en">OFIP believes that Canada's former position of agreeing to the idea of a Palestinian state only after it has reached agreement with the State of Israel was untenable. To draw a parallel with domestic policy, it would be like supporting a woman's right to divorce as long as her husband agreed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693698" data-originallang="en">We are encouraged by Minister Joly's new formulation, issued a month ago, that Canada reserves the right to recognize the State of Palestine at the right time. We believe the right time is now. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693699" data-originallang="en">Many would argue that recognition of the State of Palestine is merely a symbolic act because Palestine does not have the powers of a state. That is true. Today the government of Palestine does not control its own borders, its own water, its own airspace or its own telecommunications. It does not have an airport, and its only seaport is under blockade. Israel exerts complete control over the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in defiance of several UN resolutions. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693700" data-originallang="en">However, recognizing states that are not yet in control of their territory has many precedents. During World War II, many western countries recognized governments in exile from countries under Nazi occupation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693701" data-originallang="en">Recognizing Palestine, however, is not only symbolic. If Canada recognizes Palestine, this must have concrete repercussions. Among these are a revision of the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement, Canadian support for full membership of Palestine at the UN and full support for Palestine's right to use international institutions, including the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693702" data-originallang="en">Canada's recognition of the State of Palestine should be without prejudice to the outcome of any future negotiations between the parties. A future solution to the Israel-Palestine issue might be a two-state solution, it could be a fusion to create a single state or it could be some kind of confederation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693703" data-originallang="en">Canada should prioritize urgent action in support of human rights and freedom. Canada's focus should not be on endless negotiations about a two-state solution but on the urgent need to protect Palestinian rights. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693704" data-originallang="en">Canada should, without delay, join the over 130 countries in the world today, including several European allies, that officially recognize the State of Palestine.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693705" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much.</p>
