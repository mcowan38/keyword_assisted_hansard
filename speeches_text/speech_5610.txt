<p data-HoCid="8760389" data-originallang="en"> Maybe I can take a couple of moments to explain the amendment.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8760390" data-originallang="en">The amendment, in my view, is substantively different from the motion moved. This is important, because my specific amendment calls for the committee to examine the origins or the development of the special immigration measure.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8760391" data-originallang="en">This special immigration measure is different from the other special immigration measures. Take, as examples, the Kuwait program and the program to facilitate bringing Ukrainians to safety, and rightly so. They are much wider and broader. In this instance, we have a measure that is particularly limiting.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8760392" data-originallang="en"> As a result, people are wondering why that is the case. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8760393" data-originallang="en">Then, I think, it would be important for the committee to examine the development and execution of the government's special immigration measures for Canadian Gazan families. As well, there are additional issues related to this matter in terms of bringing people to safety, and that is in relation to Canada's diplomatic relations. It would be an important component for us to get an understanding of that as related to this measure.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8760394" data-originallang="en">Finally, last but not least, I think it's important to hear from affected family members, as well as civil society. Many of them have been working very hard in trying to help bring people to safety, and families have direct experience with the current program and where some of the fault lines are. Unless we fully understand what those fault lines are from their perspective, we're not going to be able to fix them, or to at least try. I think it's important to incorporate these elements into the motion, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8760395" data-originallang="en">All of this came from my original motion that I had given notice of to the committee some weeks ago. Then, of course, the Liberals came forward with a revised and much truncated version of it, but I think that if we're going to do justice to the Palestinian community, to Gazan families, we need to do a thorough job.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8760396" data-originallang="en">Those are the reasons for my amendment. After that, Mr. Chair, I will have another amendment to make, but we'll go forward with this first.</p>
