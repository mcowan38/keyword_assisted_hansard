<p data-HoCid="8092103" data-originallang="en">You reference the anti-Semitic killings at the Tree of Life. I'll reference the Islamophobic killings in London, Ontario, and Quebec City; the homophobic killings in Colorado Springs; and the racist killings in Buffalo, New York, and Charleston, South Carolina. We can go on and on. I note that, in 2022, every single ideologically motivated mass murder in North America was provoked by far-right terrorism. That is a clear and present danger to our democracy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8092104" data-originallang="en">The Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center have started their “Stop Hate For Profit”, which comes from Meta's unbelievably irresponsible actions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8092105" data-originallang="en">I would like to ask you a question, Mr. Ahmed. Canada subsidizes Meta and Google indirectly by providing massive subsidies—over $1 billion a year for businesses to advertise on Meta. It's a tax write-off. The Canadian taxpayer picks up the tab for Meta and Google. Do you believe this is a responsible action, to so heavily subsidize companies that are engaged in that deliberate fomentation of hate? </p>
<p data-HoCid="8092106" data-originallang="en">To what extent can we push back against anti-Semitism and Islamophobia by ending that massive subsidy to these companies?</p>
