<p data-HoCid="7345450" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345451" data-originallang="en">I want to thank Minister Hussen and the team from the department who are joining us today to address this egregious error that took place in terms of funding for the CMAC.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345452" data-originallang="en">First, Minister, I want to thank you for reiterating our government's unwavering commitment to tackling all forms of racism and hate, including anti-Semitism, particularly since the government did adopt the IHRA definition in 2019 and made a strong commitment for a whole-of-government approach in ensuring that anti-Semitism and all forms of hate are not seen in any of our programming or in any of our departments.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345453" data-originallang="en">I'd like to thank you as well for being here today to talk about the action you're taking to hold Laith Marouf and the CMAC accountable for the hateful, anti-Semitic and racist comments that Mr. Marouf made and to ensure that no organization like this ever—and I repeat “ever”—receives federal anti-racism funding again.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345454" data-originallang="en">As the minister has stated, he's been working with organizations, and I can say, as a member of the community, that I'm very grateful for the time and attention that's been put, both among colleagues and with the CIJA, the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal, and B'nai Brith into working together to resolve this issue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345455" data-originallang="en">I understand the situation was brought to your attention by our colleague, MP Housefather, and that you and your office were to cut off the funding for the CMAC, as you mentioned in your opening statement, and to put in place new processes to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345456" data-originallang="en">Minister, I'd like you to take some time to explain the steps that are being taken to ensure that organizations like the CMAC never slip through the cracks in terms of applying for funding through the Department of Canadian Heritage.</p>
