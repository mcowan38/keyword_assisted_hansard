<p data-HoCid="6933120" data-originallang="en">We included taxes in previous cost estimates related to DND, and it led to some side discussions in some quarters about whether it's appropriate to include taxes or not, and whether DND and the government are subject to taxes. It led to a side discussion that was not central to the point of the report, which is the cost estimate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6933121" data-originallang="en">We decided to exclude taxes from this estimate to avoid a repeat of that discussion as to whether the government does pay tax, should pay tax, gets it back and so on. That easily goes down a rabbit hole that is not the cost estimate.</p>
