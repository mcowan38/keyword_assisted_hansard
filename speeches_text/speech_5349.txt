<p data-HoCid="8665257" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, on the same point of order, not only is that absolutely false, but also, number one, I have never threatened anyone with violence in this place, and number two, in this instance, the member for <a data-HoCid="278491" href="/politicians/francis-drouin/" title="Francis Drouin">Glengarry—Prescott—Russell</a> made a homophobic comment in the House mere minutes ago. I encouraged him, in raising my hands, to stand up and make the same comment again. Now, should NDP members be okay with that type of conduct in here, I will leave it to their own conscience and for them to explain it to their constituents. I can tell members that I find it reprehensible and unacceptable. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8665258" data-originallang="en">The member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> should withdraw her statement and apologize because the claim she has made is unsubstantiated. It has not been captured in Hansard, and it certainly has not been adjudicated on by the Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8665259" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I would ask that you invite that member to apologize for saying something that is demonstrably not true.</p>
