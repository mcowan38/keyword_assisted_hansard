<p data-HoCid="8726934" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, today, on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, the NDP stands in solidarity with women, girls and gender-diverse people facing violence in our communities and around the world. Globally, nearly one in three women have faced physical or sexual violence in their lifetime, and every day 140 women and girls are killed by family members. From Afghanistan to Ukraine, from Gaza to Sudan, the realities of war disproportionately devastate women, robbing them of safety, dignity and opportunity.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726935" data-originallang="en">Canada must do more. A feminist foreign policy means committing to peacekeeping, supporting survivors of sexual and gender-based violence and ensuring women are at the forefront of conflict resolution and recovery. Violence against women is not inevitable. It is a choice that we can work to end together. We must act boldly and compassionately for a world where everyone is free from violence and fear.</p>
