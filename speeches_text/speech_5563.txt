<p data-HoCid="8722841" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, what is happening in Gaza is horrific. Canadians have watched in shock as death tolls mount. People have starved to death and hospitals are being bombed. They need justice now. The International Criminal Court recently issued warrants for Prime Minister Netanyahu, former minister Gallant, and Hamas leader Deif.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8722842" data-originallang="en">It is time for a government that is clear and unequivocal, because this one has let people down before on international justice and human rights. How can we trust that the Liberals will enforce the ICC rulings and arrest warrants?</p>
