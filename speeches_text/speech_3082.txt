<p data-HoCid="8097557" data-originallang="en"> I'll do it, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8097558" data-originallang="en">I'm warning members that this is their last chance to support one of my amendments. If they were planning on supporting one of them, this is it. This is the time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8097559" data-originallang="en">Mr. Gerretsen, if you wish to support it, you can maybe consult with your whip to sub in. I won't go any further down that rabbit hole.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8097560" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, the amendment I'd like to put forward is effectively the same as the previous amendment, except in this case it applies to BDC instead of EDC. This is to support BDC in making investments that would help develop domestic munitions-manufacturing capacity in Ukraine.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8097561" data-originallang="en">I think these changes are substantial and important. I hope that members will, at this late stage, have a clarification of conscience and do the right thing by supporting one of the many amendments that I have put forward, aimed at facilitating weapons export and manufacturing in Ukraine.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8097562" data-originallang="en">As we've said previously, what Ukraine needs most is not a carbon tax. I would say Ukraine doesn't need a carbon tax at all. What Ukraine needs is not provisions on carbon leakage that would effectively create the mechanism by which there could be pressure to further increase that. Rather, Ukraine needs the munitions and the support to prosecute this war and to achieve a decisive victory.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8097563" data-originallang="en">This is why we have put forward a series of amendments that, if adopted, would have significantly improved the process involved in munitions exports and supporting investments in munitions in Ukraine.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8097564" data-originallang="en">In all seriousness, I do hope that, rather than just voting against these measures, Liberals and New Democrats will take a serious look at what is required to support our partners and allies in Ukraine and support this amendment.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8097565" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
