<p data-HoCid="7322246" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7322247" data-originallang="en">I want to thank my friend, Mrs. Thomas, for her comments. I agree with some of what she said, and not with some of the other parts of what she said.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7322248" data-originallang="en">I agree that it was absolutely outrageous that Laith Marouf and CMAC received any contract from the Government of Canada to perform anti-racism training. The man is an abject anti-Semite, and has made horrible comments about indigenous Canadians, racialized Canadians, French Canadians and many other groups, although the bulk of his comments were directed against Jews. As I said before, the contract should have been immediately terminated.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7322249" data-originallang="en">I think there has been a widespread recognition that the minister has come to, acknowledging this contract should never have happened, and has stated that remedies are needed. There needs to be better training, there needs to be better due diligence, and there need to be revisions to the contract and certification declaration. That is why I believe he's going to come to committee. He should be presenting to us, so that the committee can do its due diligence, and can be satisfied with the changes that are made to this process, so that somebody like Mr. Marouf and CMAC never get a contract from the Government of Canada again.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7322250" data-originallang="en">Where I disagree is that the minister accountable here is <a data-HoCid="278914" href="/politicians/ahmed-hussen/" title="Ahmed Hussen">Minister Hussen</a>. The anti-racism strategy falls under Minister Hussen. The contract falls under his ministry. I don't want to allot less time to Minister Hussen than he deserves when he comes and presents the changes he is making. Should the committee, after that, feel that other people need to be heard from then the committee can come to that conclusion, but I don't think that's the case. On this point, <a data-HoCid="278929" href="/politicians/pablo-rodriguez/" title="Pablo Rodriguez">Minister Rodriguez</a> is not the minister responsible, Minister Hussen is the minister responsible.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7322251" data-originallang="en">As a Jewish MP, I feel that people from all sides need to speak out against this. It shouldn't be Jewish MPs carrying the ball on an issue that directly impacts the Jewish community. We all need to speak out with respect to anti-Semitism and all forms of racism. I think this was a lesson for all of us that when other groups are impacted, we need to speak out even stronger.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7322252" data-originallang="en">I hope we'll all take lessons from this, but I don't think, as I said before, that <a data-HoCid="278929" href="/politicians/pablo-rodriguez/" title="Pablo Rodriguez">Minister Rodriguez</a> is the right minister. <a data-HoCid="278914" href="/politicians/ahmed-hussen/" title="Ahmed Hussen">Minister Hussen</a> is the right minister to come before the committee, and that's the person who should be appearing on Friday. That's what the committee originally had determined.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7322253" data-originallang="en">Thank you so much, Madam Chair.</p>
