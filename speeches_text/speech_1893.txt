<p data-HoCid="7347687" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to add my voice of disgust to the shocking news that the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> knew about disgusting, anti-Semitic hate that was being spread and funded by the government for a month before any action was taken. The worst part is he took action only after he got caught and exposed for doing nothing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7347688" data-originallang="en">I may not be of Jewish faith, but as a Christian, as a voice in this House and simply as a human being, I feel an obligation to call out and condemn this shameful silence. Why, at a time when anti-Semitic acts here in Canada and around the world are on the rise, did it take a month for the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> to do anything? It is clear that he knew, and it is clear that he did nothing until he was caught.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7347689" data-originallang="en">I stand with Jewish leaders in condemning the deafening silence of our <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>. We need to be united in confronting anti-Semitism when we see it, every single time. Shame on the government and shame on the Prime Minister.</p>
