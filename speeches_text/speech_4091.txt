<p data-HoCid="8406070" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I'm going to have a shorter preamble, I hope, than Mr. Fortin did. That would be the normal practice. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8406071" data-originallang="en">I want to start by joining Mr. Housefather to say that when I voted in favour of this study, I naively assumed that this committee might be able to set aside relentless partisanship to shine a light on this problem and to search for solutions. I am disappointed at some of the things that have happened early on in this room, and I hope we will get our focus back onto the problem of anti-Semitism and the problems that Jewish students are facing. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8406072" data-originallang="en">Like anyone who has ties to the Jewish community, I am not surprised—I have ties in my riding and I have long, historical family ties to Jewish communities—but it's still shocking to hear all of you here, from various backgrounds and various institutions, reporting that the same thing is happening in Canada. I thank you for bringing this to the attention of the public. I thank you for taking the risk you're taking personally, because I know there's a personal risk of retaliation and harassment as a result of your being here today, and I don't think we should minimize that at all. So we owe you a debt of thanks for being here. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8406073" data-originallang="en">Rather than making a long speech myself, I particularly want to hear what you have to say about this problem. I know a couple of you didn't quite get to finish your remarks at the beginning, so I'm going to give you an opportunity without asking you a specific question. I'm going to go to Mr. Eshayek first for anything he didn't quite get to do within that time, and I'll make the same available to others. </p>
