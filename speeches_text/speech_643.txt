<p data-HoCid="6520134" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6520135" data-originallang="en">I share some of the concerns of MP Gazan about people's lives being at stake here. They're looking for EI benefits that they have earned and have paid for. I'm a little concerned with the direction we're going, doing another study on this, or working on a study, without going back to the last larger study on EI back in June 2016 of the 42 Parliament, entitled “Exploring the Impact of Recent Changes to Employment Insurance and Ways to Improve Access to the Program”. That's the study I'd like to talk about.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6520136" data-originallang="en"> The number one recommendation—I think it's very fitting that we talk about the first recommendation, which is going to be important during a pandemic—is as follows: </p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="6520137" data-originallang="en"> The Committee recommends that the federal government review the eligibility requirement for “valid job separation” to allow employment insurance claimants who find a new job during the benefits period to retain their EI benefits should the employment not be suitable. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="6520138" data-originallang="en">In the context, I'm worried about the families and individuals out there who may have lost a job, unfortunately, because of the restrictions out there, or who claim EI, find another job, but then are out of work when maybe another lockdown occurs in their province. I'd like to hear an update on the number one recommendation from that report. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6520139" data-originallang="en">Has the EI program added to the flexibility so that these workers don't fall through the cracks?</p>
