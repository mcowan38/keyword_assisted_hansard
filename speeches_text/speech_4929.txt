<p data-HoCid="8576847" data-originallang="fr">Madam Speaker, I can certainly say that there is no ambiguity when it comes to defending Montreal's Jewish community. The federal government has absolutely no tolerance for anti-Semitism in Canada. Unfortunately, the problem is that the Conservatives are trying to blame the federal government for decisions made by Mayor Plante, decisions made by municipal authorities and decisions made by the province.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576848" data-originallang="fr">I should point out that the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> has asked me to look into these issues. I will be working closely with the various levels of government to try to improve things in Montreal and across Canada. More specifically, I have been working with McGill and other Quebec universities to try to improve the situation for students on campus.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576849" data-originallang="fr">I think the situation is better this year, although it is definitely not perfect.</p>
