<p data-HoCid="7999930" data-originallang="en">There are significant risks associated with the current conflict in the Middle East. There are currently many analysts considering the possible impact of the ramped-up enforcement of sanctions on Iran. This would occur in case there's a northern front opening for Israel, in which case there may be ramped-up sanctions on the export of oil from Iran, which is currently facing secondary sanctions from the United States. However, the full enforcement of these sanctions has been relaxed somewhat over the last few years, as efforts have been made to improve relations between the United States and Iran. </p>
