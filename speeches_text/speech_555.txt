<p data-HoCid="6485171" data-originallang="en">What we have done, and we announced this on Holocaust Remembrance Day this week, is this. If you search for those kinds of terms, terms related to the Holocaust—“swastika”, “white supremacy”—you are going to get a notification that directs you to an off-site website developed with the World Jewish Congress, that gives you credible information on the Holocaust. </p>

They will immediately have access to that information when they search for those kinds of terms.</p>
