<p data-HoCid="8702860" data-originallang="en">Today's meeting is taking place in a hybrid format. I'd like to remind participants of the following points, and this goes for members as well as witnesses. Please wait until I recognize you by name before you speak. All comments should be addressed through the chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8702861" data-originallang="en">Pursuant to Standing Order 108(2) and the motion adopted by the committee on Thursday, September 19, 2024, the committee is resuming its study of Canada's advancement of a two-state solution.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8702862" data-originallang="en">I'd now like to welcome our three panellists.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8702863" data-originallang="en">From B'nai Brith, we have Mr. Henry Topas, who is the director for Quebec and Atlantic Canada.</p>

<p data-HoCid="8702866" data-originallang="en">You will each be provided five minutes for your opening remarks. Please do look over this way every once in a while, not only with respect to your opening remarks but also following questions from the members. There are time limits, so if you see me signalling you, that means you should wrap it up in about 20 seconds or so.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8702867" data-originallang="en">All of that having been explained, we will go to Mr. Topas for his opening remarks.</p>
