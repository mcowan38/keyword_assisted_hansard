<p data-HoCid="6791841" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much for the information you've given so far. I also want to thank you for pointing out that when it comes to UN resolutions, Israel is unfairly singled out compared to human rights issues with many other nations. I appreciate that you're making that point.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791842" data-originallang="en">It's kind of a complicated situation when it comes to the aid that we're providing. I know the government's announced $25 million. We're providing aid into a region.... We all know we need to help Palestinian citizens in the aftermath of this latest conflict, but we're dealing with a region that is controlled, as you said, by a terrorist organization that has not had an election for 17 years. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6791843" data-originallang="en">How does Canada make sure that the aid that goes into the region isn't falling into the hands of the wrong people and isn't winding up somehow with Hamas to build more rockets, rather than getting to the Palestinian people who so desperately need this assistance?</p>
