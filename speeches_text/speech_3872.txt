<p data-HoCid="8301137" data-originallang="en"> Madam Chair, as a non-permanent member of this committee, I want to add my voice in support of the motion Mr. Housefather brought forward and the very legitimate concerns he's raised. I want to commend him for his passionate, appropriate speech in the House of Commons this week, where he articulated the fears and threats that are part of Jewish life in Canada today. This is not a Canada that I grew up with. It shouldn't be the Canada we have going forward. I hope this study will allow us to identify alternatives to address this very pernicious problem within our society.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301138" data-originallang="en">I will also be speaking at an event in support of the Jewish community this Sunday in Vancouver. I want to assure Mr. Housefather that I will be sharing his concerns at that event. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8301139" data-originallang="en">I support the elegant solution Mr. Maloney suggested, which has been presented to this committee: Conduct, effectively, two studiesâ€”one on Islamophobia and one on anti-Semitism. However, I also want to articulate my strong support for the original motion Mr. Housefather brought forward. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8301140" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
