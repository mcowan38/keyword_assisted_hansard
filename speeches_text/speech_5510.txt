<p data-HoCid="8676517" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of the work of the United Nations. Canada helped build the UN. After the horrors of World War II, we were leaders in terms of peacekeeping and leaders in supporting peace and human rights through multilateralism. In recent months, we have seen an unprecedented attack on the UN by Israel's far-right government. It has killed UN workers in Gaza, pushed to defund and then ban UNRWA, bombed 70% of UNRWA locations in Gaza, shot at UN peacekeepers in Lebanon, banned the UN Secretary-General and attacked the UN special rapporteur on Palestine.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8676518" data-originallang="en"> Where is Canada to defend the UN and stand up to Israel's far-right government waging genocide? Canada is part of the problem. We must never forget the lessons of history. Canada and Canadians can and must be a voice in support of the UN and multilateralism, and take concrete action to stop genocide and stand up for peace now.</p>
