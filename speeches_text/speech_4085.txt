<p data-HoCid="8376985" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, May 5 marked National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, also known as Red Dress Day.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8376986" data-originallang="en">Alarmingly, despite comprising only 4.3% of the population, indigenous women are four times more likely than non-indigenous women to be the victims of violence, making up 16% of all female homicide victims and 11% of missing women. Since last year, I have been working with my friend, the member of Parliament for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>, to implement a red dress alert system to rapidly notify the public when an indigenous woman, girl or two-spirit person goes missing. I have been honoured to take part in the consultations that have been indigenous-led and informed. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8376987" data-originallang="en">I am also thrilled with the rapid action our government has taken on this, in particular, the former and current <a data-HoCid="299998" href="/politicians/gary-anandasangaree/" title="Gary Anandasangaree">Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations</a>, leading to the announcement last week, in partnership with the Province of Manitoba, to implement a regional red dress alert pilot program.</p>
