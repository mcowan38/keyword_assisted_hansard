<p data-HoCid="8429193" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, I have immense respect for the <a data-HoCid="300661" href="/politicians/sameer-zuberi/" title="Sameer Zuberi">parliamentary secretary</a> as a person, but citing the amount of money being thrown at the problem is not enough because we see the efficacy of this government's efforts. What it is doing is not good enough, and unfortunately, what it is doing is not working.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8429194" data-originallang="en">The safety and security of Canadians are first and foremost a responsibility of the Canadian government, yet one need only look at campuses across this country or speak to anyone from the Jewish community and, increasingly, non-Jewish Canadians to know that safety is top of mind for everyone, alongside the challenges of affordability and the cost of living. What this government is doing and continuing to propagate by sharing the same talking points is not going to make us any safer.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8429195" data-originallang="en">Is anyone investigating what is happening at these encampments and will the government take action? What will it take?</p>
