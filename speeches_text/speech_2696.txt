<p data-HoCid="7976698" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Chair, and thank you to the witnesses today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7976699" data-originallang="en">Conservatives will certainly cut red tape, make Canada competitive again and ensure that both traditional and clean energy development can actually happen in this country and that we can export that to the world.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7976700" data-originallang="en">Chair, I'm going to use my time to talk about the severe geopolitical consequences of the eight years of NDP-Liberal of anti-energy, anti-private-sector, anti-development policies that have made Canada uncompetitive. It is relative to the notice of motion that I tabled on Friday, October 13. It is urgent, and I hope to make the case in the next few minutes for raising it today. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7976701" data-originallang="en">The reality is this, and this is why it is so timely: </p>
<p data-HoCid="7976702" data-originallang="en">Our G7 partner, France, signed an LNG deal with Qatar last week for 27 years. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7976703" data-originallang="en">Last year, Germany signed a deal with Qatar for LNG after they had asked for Canadian LNG and the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> had said there was no business case. Germany asked for that to end their energy dependence on Putin. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7976704" data-originallang="en">This is important because of the escalating conflict in the Middle East, because Qatar houses the head of Hamas, which is currently attacking Israel and wreaking havoc on innocent people throughout the Middle East. This is the truth.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7976705" data-originallang="en"> It's undeniable now that the Liberal government's eight years of anti-energy, anti-private-sector, anti-development policies enrich the backers of Hamas, the sadistic terrorist organization impacting the whole world right now. I am sure that this is an urgent and top priority for every member of the natural resources committee right now. Canada is the fifth-largest producer of natural gas in the world, with 71 trillion cubic feet underneath us, the 17th-largest proven reserves globally.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7976706" data-originallang="en">In eight years of <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Justin Trudeau</a>, 18 LNG proposals were made. Zero have actually been built. Canada exports zero LNG. Only one facility is under construction, which was approved previously by the Conservative government just before the Liberals took office. There were 18 proposals, only one of which is on its way to being built, and there is no potential for exports for the next few years.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7976707" data-originallang="en">Those are the real, severe geopolitical and economic consequences of eight years of anti-energy, anti-development and anti-private-sector policies. Today, with the situation that this <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> has created, Canada's G7 allies—France and Germany—are signing a deal with Qatar, which is hiding the head of Hamas. Japan is also in talks with Qatar, a counterbalance to a different state regime that is hostile to Canada and the free world.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7976708" data-originallang="en">Again, let us be clear for every single member of Parliament on this committee and for all Canadians that after eight years of this government, of these policies, zero LNG terminals to export from Canada have been built, but allies are buying up big from the regime that houses terrorists and the head of Hamas right now. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7976709" data-originallang="en">Therefore, I move:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7976710" data-originallang="en"> That, given the fact that Qatar has signed a liquefied natural gas (LNG) deal with France for 27 years, for 3.5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA), and given the fact Qatar has signed an LNG deal with Germany for 15 years, for two MTPA, and given the fact that the German Chancellor called on Canada for more LNG, saying, “As Germany is moving away from Russian energy at warp speed, Canada is our partner of choice. This means increasing our LNG imports. We hope that Canadian LNG will play a major role in this.”, and given the fact that when the current Liberal prime minister took office there were 18 LNG terminals proposed and after eight years of his government, zero have been completed, the committee call on the House to denounce the regulatory regime established by this government that has not completed a single LNG export terminal, and that the committee report to the House its opinion that Canada should do everything it can to export its clean energy to the world. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7976711" data-originallang="en"> I ask today that this committee see the urgency, the urgent and severe consequences of eight years of the Liberals' anti-energy, anti-development, anti-Canada policy agenda and the consequences of our allies enriching a country that houses the head of Hamas right now. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7976712" data-originallang="en">I urge all the members of this committee, for the sake of our country and our allies, to debate and vote in favour of this motion right now.</p>
