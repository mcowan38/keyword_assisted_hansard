<p data-HoCid="7697645" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, more than six million Jewish people were murdered between 1933 and 1945, and more than two and a half million were transported in cattle cars to death camps for extermination. I acknowledge that it is a strong word, but it is appropriate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7697646" data-originallang="fr">Those people were systematically, unceremoniously and unemotionally killed for no other reason than that they were Jewish. The Warsaw ghetto uprising began on April 19, 1943, but by May 16 of that same year, the revolt had been crushed, the ghetto lay in ruins, and the cattle cars were packed with prisoners. Our Jewish brothers and sisters, as well as their children, were crammed in like sardines and transported to extermination camps.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7697647" data-originallang="fr">Eighty years ago, heroes rose up to protect their families and compatriots. Their courage leaves me speechless with admiration. Gas chambers, extermination, unsanitary conditions, famine, slavery, dehumanization: Humans are capable of the highest good, but also of the worst evil, and that is rather frightening.</p>
