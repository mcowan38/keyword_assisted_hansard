<p data-HoCid="8249238" data-originallang="en"> <em>Uqaqtittiji</em>, I am honoured to rise on Bill <a data-HoCid="12138647" href="/bills/44-1/C-35/" title="An Act respecting early learning and child care in Canada">C-35</a>, an act respecting early learning and child care in Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8249239" data-originallang="en">I am proud to represent Nunavut and to be the critic for indigenous issues and northern affairs.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8249240" data-originallang="en">I thank my colleague and friend, the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>, for her leadership in ensuring that Bill <a data-HoCid="12138647" href="/bills/44-1/C-35/" title="An Act respecting early learning and child care in Canada">C-35</a> will positively impact Inuit, first nations and Métis.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8249241" data-originallang="en">Early learning and child care are of particular importance to indigenous peoples. Canada used all the resources it could to rob indigenous parents of their children. It used churches, RCMP and Indian agents. Indigenous children were sent to residential schools, and intergenerational trauma still exists because of Canada's genocidal policies against indigenous peoples. Amidst this, it has taken decades for this bill to finally reach this stage, which is so close to passing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8249242" data-originallang="en">I thank the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> for reminding us, in her speech, about who was instrumental in this. I echo her gratitude. She stated:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8249243" data-originallang="en"> Generations of feminists, trade unionists, child care workers and advocates made this victory possible. They never, ever gave up the fight. They did not give up after the 1970 Royal Commission on the Status of Women's recommendation for a national child care program was ignored by the government of the day. They did not give up after the 1993 Liberal red book promised national child care, only for that government to pursue deep cuts to social programs instead. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8249244" data-originallang="en">New Democrats who have fought for this include the mayor of Toronto, Olivia Chow, and the current member for <a data-HoCid="278292" href="/politicians/lindsay-mathyssen/" title="Lindsay Mathyssen">London—Fanshawe</a>. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8249245" data-originallang="en">What would Bill <a data-HoCid="12138647" href="/bills/44-1/C-35/" title="An Act respecting early learning and child care in Canada">C-35</a> do? It would ensure a long-term commitment of federal funding to provinces, territories and indigenous groups. It would provide the opportunity for a national system of early learning and child care. It would indeed help ensure that parents across Canada have access to affordable, accessible and high-quality child care, now and into the future.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8249246" data-originallang="en"> The NDP fought hard to ensure that Bill <a data-HoCid="12138647" href="/bills/44-1/C-35/" title="An Act respecting early learning and child care in Canada">C-35</a> takes a rights-based approach. Because of our work, it includes acknowledgements of the obligations that Canada must adhere to international human rights conventions and declarations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8249247" data-originallang="en">For example, the third paragraph of the preamble affirms critical international instruments, including the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8249248" data-originallang="en">I return to the importance of passing Bill <a data-HoCid="12138647" href="/bills/44-1/C-35/" title="An Act respecting early learning and child care in Canada">C-35</a>. We all know that difficulty finding day care impacts the ability of parents to work.</p>
