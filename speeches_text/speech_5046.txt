<p data-HoCid="8660202" data-originallang="en"> Is it fair to say this goes well beyond Russia? I would put it to you that in my experience, we love to oversimplify this as Russian or Chinese, or maybe Indian sometimes, but is it not fair to say there are various state-sponsored Internet propaganda machines being used to spread this?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8660203" data-originallang="en">I would reference Operation Earnest Voice in the United States of America. You talked about Donald Trump. Obviously, the United States was a prime propagator of the Chinese virus during COVID and a lot of vaccine misinformation and disinformation. Israel, a so-called ally, has the <em>hasbara</em>. It has a whole ministry of strategic affairs that deals with targeting political actors, and I know that's come out in the United States.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8660204" data-originallang="en">Can you maybe just take a step back, zoom out and talk a bit more beyond just Russia in terms of state-sponsored Internet propaganda machines out there?</p>
