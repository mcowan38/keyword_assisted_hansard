<p data-HoCid="7549722" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the recent hate crime on Gauri Shankar Hindu Mandir in Brampton is just one of the many attacks in recent times against Hindu temples in Canada by anti-Hindu and anti-India groups. As with Islamophobia and anti-Semitism, resulting in hate crimes against our mosques and synagogues and causing pain to our Muslim and Jewish brothers and sisters, Hindu Canadians are experiencing the same pain due to rising Hinduphobia. As predicted by a study, Hinduphobia on social media is now graduating to physical attacks. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7549723" data-originallang="en">I call upon Canada to take serious note of this alarming trend and respond appropriately. As Canadians, we practise, celebrate and share our many different religious faiths and heritage peacefully. Let us pledge to continue to do so.</p>
