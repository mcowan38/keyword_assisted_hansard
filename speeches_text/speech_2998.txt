<p data-HoCid="8019353" data-originallang="fr">The current conflict between Israel and Palestine is attracting global media attention, as well as the attention of governments in Europe, America and around the world, much like at the beginning of the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8019354" data-originallang="fr">I would like to know if the attention paid to this new conflict is being felt on the ground, on the battles underway on Ukrainian territory. Is the fact that the entire world is no longer watching the conflict having an impact on the ground at this time?</p>
