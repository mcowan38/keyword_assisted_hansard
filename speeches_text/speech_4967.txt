<p data-HoCid="8598716" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, let us be clear. Protesting for peace in the Middle East and mourning the civilian death toll is legitimate, but shouting, “We are Hamas, we are Hezbollah” or “Death to Canada” in protest on October 7, as we saw in Vancouver, is despicable.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8598717" data-originallang="fr">This echoes the problems we are also hearing about in Quebec. The Bloc Québécois unreservedly condemns such statements. There is a difference, a gulf, between freedom of expression and claiming to be part of a known terrorist entity. There is a wide gap between wishing for the Palestinians' safety and freedom and calling for the death of Canada. That is coming from a separatist.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8598718" data-originallang="fr">I have a message for those who really want a ceasefire. They should ask their federal government why it is doing absolutely nothing rather than intimidating their Jewish neighbours in Quebec and Canada. They have nothing to do with this. That is the difference between a pro-Palestinian protest for peace and an anti-Semitic rally to incite violence.</p>
