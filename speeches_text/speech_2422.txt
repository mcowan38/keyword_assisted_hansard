<p data-HoCid="7847441" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, it is too bad, but Bill <a data-HoCid="12265330" href="/bills/44-1/C-41/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code and to make consequential amendments to other Acts">C-41</a> is not the solution to such a vitally important issue. This bill was flawed from the start. The work should have been done by Global Affairs Canada, not Public Safety Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7847442" data-originallang="fr">The NDP cannot support a bill that says that the international solidarity sector must request the Canadian government's authorization to go save lives abroad. The premise of this bill, which involves getting the permission of a government, the Government of Canada, goes against the humanitarian principles of neutrality, independence and impartiality.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7847443" data-originallang="fr">The NDP feels it is unacceptable to have a bill that could criminalize foreign aid in the Gaza Strip, for example. There is a risk that people who want to help and save lives could face criminal prosecution. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7847444" data-originallang="fr">Why are the Liberals proposing a bill that could have those sorts of consequences?</p>
