<p data-HoCid="7602079" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7602080" data-originallang="en">Thank you for being here today, both of you. In my second round, I'll come back to where we are now and what changes have been made to the process to stop this from ever happening again, but I need to start with where we started from. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7602081" data-originallang="en">As for Laith Marouf and why this is important for Canadians, this was his Twitter description: “I have a motto: Life is too short for shoes with laces or for entertaining Jewish white supremacists with anything but a bullet to the head.” That was the top thing you saw on his Twitter feed. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7602082" data-originallang="en">In 2021, we had a rise in anti-Semitism like we've never seen. We had to hold a national summit, the first national summit on anti-Semitism, and this was his tweet about it: “A wacko Indigenous House-Slave of Apartheid Canada, from the 'First Nations Confederacy of Educational Centres', opens the Jewish White Supremacist Colonist conference hosted by the Zionist Lobby, PM @JustinTrudeau and Apartheid Israel; to infer Indigenity on Zionist Colonists.” These things were in his Twitter, along with racist, francophobic, horrible things. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7602083" data-originallang="en">On April 14, 2022, a press release was issued. I can understand what you said, that you only looked at CMAC for the grants, but a press release was issued that quoted both Laith Marouf and <a data-HoCid="278914" href="/politicians/ahmed-hussen/" title="Ahmed Hussen">Ahmed Hussen</a>. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7602084" data-originallang="en">At that point, did anyone bother to google Laith Marouf?</p>
