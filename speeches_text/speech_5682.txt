<p data-HoCid="8741982" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, today is the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. Like the member, I too agree that we need all the hostages released, and all the remains of the hostage problems should be cleared. Along with several Jewish Canadians, there are many Palestinian Canadians who have lost their families among the 43,000 people killed in Gaza, the vast majority of whom are women and children.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8741983" data-originallang="en">I would like to ask the member whether she has any tears or consolation for the Canadians who have lost their family in Gaza.</p>
