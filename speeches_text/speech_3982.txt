<p data-HoCid="8355407" data-originallang="en"> For the purpose of this committee and for the purpose of the good welfare of open and transparent government, I would request that you submit that list of referrals to the Attorney General's office for the reflection of this committee in response to the work that you're doing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8355408" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, at this time, I'd like to just table a notice of motion. I won't be debating it, but I think it's in keeping with the trends of the lack of forthrightness and truthfulness at this committee. I'm not moving it but just tabling it today. The motion, which will be distributed, reads:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8355409" data-originallang="en"> That, in relation to the testimony provided by Google during their committee appearance on December 13, 2023, in which Ms. Jeanette Patell stated that Project Nimbus is not directed at highly sensitive or classified military workloads that are relevant to weapons or intelligence services, and recent reports that the Israeli military is using artificial intelligence for surveillance and to identify targets for air strikes in Gaza, and contracts signed in December 2024 between Google and the Israeli ministry of defence for the further build-out of the Google Cloud platform, the committee write to Google and seek clarification on their previous testimony and information on whether Project Nimbus or other Google Cloud services are being used to support AI-targeted air strikes in Gaza; that Google respond in writing within 15 days of receiving the committee's letter; and that, should Google fail to meet this deadline, the committee request the following people to appear before it at the earliest opportunity: Sabrina Geremia, VP and country managing director for Google Canada, and Sam Sebastian, VP and country manager for Google Cloud. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8355410" data-originallang="en">I'm tabling that now. That will be submitted to everybody in both official languages for their consideration at future meetings.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8355411" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, having people mislead this committee is something we should take very seriously. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8355412" data-originallang="en">With that, I'll cede the rest of my time with Ms. Maynard.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8355413" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
