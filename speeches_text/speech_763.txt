<p data-HoCid="6606904" data-originallang="en"> Certainly. Let me speak to my personal involvement and how I see this as so important.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6606905" data-originallang="en">I also said that as an adviser to the board of the Indian Resource Council of Canada—Stephen Buffalo spoke earlier and that's his association—I've seen their revenues be destroyed. It's really interesting because capital markets can move capital from one area or jurisdiction to another. First nations cannot move their reserves, so I see first-hand how this affects their communities. At the same time COVID was coming down, their revenue shortfalls were crashing down, so we ended up assisting the Kainai tribe with some COVID relief. I feel for what Stephen Buffalo and his membership have been going through. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6606906" data-originallang="en">In my particular circumstance, we help with cultural events. We do movies to connect elders with young people. A lot of the things that I've heard mentioned today we just do hand in hand. I think Canada really has the gold standard in terms of how we work with first nations. On equity partnerships, we involve them on the business side. We're doing some work with the Kainai now on abandoned wells and putting people to work. This is critical to their being. I will tell you that they are proud. They really do not want handouts. They want to drive their own economic activity, and this gives them an opportunity.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6606907" data-originallang="en">With respect to the risk, MP Gazan brought up risk disclosure. That's very important. I'm really glad you brought that up, because risk disclosure has to occur on any major projects. I visit investors in New York, Houston, Europe, all over the world, and they talk about the Canadian jurisdiction as being very difficult to invest in. In the Financial Post, as I mentioned, it says there are $150 billion in cancelled projects, because the investors wouldn't take the risk. I've seen investors choose Siberia over British Columbia, because they thought the LNG development was too difficult, and we've seen Warren Buffett pull $9 billion out of Saguenay, Quebec. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6606908" data-originallang="en">It's interesting to me that a number of speakers talked about the investment community as if they are part of it. I will tell you that in the investment community, you just need to look at the register of the number of cancelled projects and the number of new ones introduced to know that Canada is a very risky jurisdiction. The $20-billion Frontier oil sands project was cancelled. That's one that had one of the most stringent environmental, social and governance to date. We've seen pipelines.... Even with equity ownership by indigenous peoples, that is not a safety valve for getting projects through. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6606909" data-originallang="en">The only main linear projects that we see going through are ones that are financed by the federal government or ones that are financed by indigenous people themselves, not so much the private industry. Gateway was about 20% or 30% owned by first nations, and that was cancelled. Keystone XL was just cancelled, with indigenous ownership, so that is no guarantee. I think the jurisdiction is just another element.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6606910" data-originallang="en">With the clarity that we're seeking, we think we can change this, and we're willing to work in the action committee to take care of that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6606911" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
