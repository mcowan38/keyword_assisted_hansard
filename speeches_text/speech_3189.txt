<p data-HoCid="8124552" data-originallang="en">I now have a couple of questions on Canada's Middle East strategy. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8124553" data-originallang="en">Votes 1b and 10b in the supplementary estimates include funding for Canada's Middle East strategy. With regard to the Middle East, and in particular the war in Israel and Palestine, what is the government's response to the proposal by the Israeli government ministers and Knesset members to voluntarily move Gazans to other countries because Israel is no longer “able to put up with the existence of an independent entity in Gaza”? </p>
<p data-HoCid="8124554" data-originallang="en">Does the government agree that moving Gazans to other countries in the Middle East or elsewhere would amount to ethnic cleansing and would therefore be illegal?</p>
