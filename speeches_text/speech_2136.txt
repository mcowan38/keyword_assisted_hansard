<p data-HoCid="7578567" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, our government is committed to holding Iran accountable for its shameless disregard for human rights and the regime's support for terrorism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7578568" data-originallang="en">I would like to emphasize the robust measures that Canada has in place against Iran and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. These measures were undertaken in response to recent incidents, as well as Iran's long-term systemic human rights violations and ongoing behaviour that destabilizes regional security.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7578569" data-originallang="en">Canada has designated the Islamic Republic of Iran under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, or IRPA, for the regime's engagement in terrorism and continuous and gross human rights violations. As a result, tens of thousands of prominent Iranian government officials, including IRGC senior officials, are now permanently inadmissible to Canada. In addition to being banned from entering Canada, current and former senior officials who are presently in the country may be investigated and deported.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7578570" data-originallang="en"> Furthermore, Canada has imposed vigorous sanctions against the Iranian regime and its leadership under the Special Economic Measures Act, which explicitly targets the IRGC and several sub-organizations. These measures ensure that all of designated individuals' assets in Canada are effectively frozen.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7578571" data-originallang="en"> Once Bill <a data-HoCid="11792112" href="/bills/44-1/S-8/" title="An Act to amend the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, to make consequential amendments to other Acts and to amend the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations">S-8</a>, an act to amend the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, becomes law, it would also align IRPA with the SEMA to ensure that all foreign nationals subject to sanctions will also be inadmissible to Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7578572" data-originallang="en"> Yesterday, the House unanimously voted to send Bill <a data-HoCid="11792112" href="/bills/44-1/S-8/" title="An Act to amend the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, to make consequential amendments to other Acts and to amend the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations">S-8</a> to committee, and I trust that the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development will review this bill expeditiously.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7578573" data-originallang="en">Additionally, Canada lists Iran as a state supporter of terrorism under the State Immunity Act. The listing, together with the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act, allows victims to bring civil actions against Iran for losses or damages relating to terrorism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7578574" data-originallang="en">The Criminal Code also sets out a terrorist listing regime to help prevent the use of Canada's financial system to further terrorist activity and to assist in the investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences. Several of Iran's key proxy actors are captured by this scheme.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7578575" data-originallang="en">For example, Canada has listed the IRGC Qods Force as a terrorist entity since 2012. It is a group recognized as responsible for terrorist operations and providing arms, funding and training to other terrorist groups.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7578576" data-originallang="en">The Government of Canada has also listed terrorist entities that have benefited from Qods Force patronage, including Hizballah, Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Taliban, and three Iran-backed regional militias that were added to the Criminal Code in 2019.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7578577" data-originallang="en">We are committed to holding the Iranian regime accountable for their crimes, human rights violations and threats against regional peace and security.</p>
