<p data-HoCid="8371608" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I appreciate my NDP colleague's work on the status of women committee. She is a true champion for women.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8371609" data-originallang="en">I have appreciated in the debate this evening how she keeps bringing up the word “abortion”, because in this country, we have to worry about the rights of women in terms of their bodies, their right to choose, being taken away. We constantly see legislation proposed by the Conservatives that would restrict a woman's right to choose. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8371610" data-originallang="en">I stand with the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> across the aisle on the right of women to choose for their own bodies. </p>
