<p data-HoCid="8069528" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8069529" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Senator, for your passionate work on ending gender-based violence and for bringing your personal experiences into this. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8069530" data-originallang="en">I have similar questions as my colleagues.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8069531" data-originallang="en">We've talked about this electronic bracelet monitoring and some of the challenges. For example, I know the Ontario chiefs of police are now reviewing whether this is an effective way to keep track of offenders. We also know that there have been breaches. As Leah Gazan mentioned, there are people who have been able to get these off.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8069532" data-originallang="en">Are you concerned that if we rely solely or too much on this bracelet and it does have vulnerabilities, we will destroy the sense of safety that survivors are feeling?</p>
