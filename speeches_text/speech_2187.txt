<p data-HoCid="7633188" data-originallang="en">That's such a good question, and a tough one. You're asking the tough questions. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7633189" data-originallang="en">Obviously, we're not-for-profits, but we're in the private sector in our way. We decided to band together, not to make profit but to try to bridge the gaps we see between where we are now and where we'd like to be. In other countries.... Israel has an amazing system, but the army and military service contribute a lot to the sort of dynamics they have.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7633190" data-originallang="en">I think government money should act as a bridge to bring us to where we need to be in terms of knowledge and understanding, to get the first success stories and a critical mass. However, that's not going to happen by putting in more weight and saying, “I'm going to help you with your IP, but if you sell, you're going to have to give me that money back.” No. It's “I'm going to help you with your IP, but if you sell your company for $50 million, I'm going to tax you when you buy a house, yacht or whatever with this $50 million, but I'm going to incentivize you to reinvest that $50 million in risky projects.” We need to create skin in the game and incentivize. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7633191" data-originallang="en">It's all right. We will lose some and we will buy some. We will also buy IP that was developed in Germany and Israel to feed the growth of our companies. We need to do this and incentivize, rather than make everything heavier or create a heavier load.</p>
