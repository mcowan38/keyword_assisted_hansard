<p data-HoCid="8282786" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, the international community must continue to provide humanitarian aid to those who so badly need it in Gaza. On January 30, Canada announced $40 million in additional humanitarian assistance to help the most vulnerable Palestinian civilians. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8282787" data-originallang="en">This brings Canada's total commitment to $100 million. As is the case for all humanitarian and development funding to the Palestinians, our additional assistance will be subject to a robust, enhanced due diligence process to ensure that no funding gets into the hands of terrorist groups like Hamas.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8282788" data-originallang="en">Let me be clear: We are going to continue to remain focused on getting more aid to the innocent civilians in Gaza.</p>
