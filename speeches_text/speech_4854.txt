<p data-HoCid="8605160" data-originallang="en">You cannot divorce the fact that recent terror plots in Canada were targeting the Jewish community from an exploration of how to counter those terror plots. We have an extremism problem in this country, and it's worsening. As a result of that, we need to take proactive measures to ensure the safety of all Canadians, but especially the Jewish community in Canada since the Jewish community is being targeted by these terror plots.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8605161" data-originallang="en">In order to combat this radicalism, this rise in extremism, we need additional funds for our national security apparatus, specifically our INSETs, to be able to proactively monitor and prevent these occurrences from happening. It's too late if we're catching people at the eleventh hour as they're attempting to engage in acts of terror. It's too late if we're having to interrupt these people as they're in the late stages of these events. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8605162" data-originallang="en">This shouldn't be taking place in Canada. We should have the funds and the resources available to our security apparatus so that we can stop these plots before they even start. That's at the screening stages for individuals who are entering this country and are already radicalized, and that's at the stage of preventing people from becoming radicalized, whether it be online or in person here in Canada.</p>
