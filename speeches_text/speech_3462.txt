<p data-HoCid="8186491" data-originallang="en">I also acknowledge World Interfaith Harmony Week, which spreads the message of unity and goodwill in the world's churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and other places of worship.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8186492" data-originallang="en">I am blessed to represent a riding with incredible diversity, and I cherish the close connections I have with our many different faith communities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8186493" data-originallang="en">I offer my best wishes for the celebrations of our patron saint that are taking place at Our Lady of Lebanon in my riding, at the cathedral in Montreal, at Saint Charbel Parish in Ottawa and all over the world.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8186494" data-originallang="en">I also offer my best to the Ummah Mosque in Halifax on its multicultural festival today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8186495" data-originallang="en">We know that interfaith dialogue has the power to promote greater harmony in Canada. That is why our government is funding grassroots initiatives that bring ethnic, cultural and religious communities together to learn from each other and strengthen our national fabric.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8186496" data-originallang="en">Let us always embrace the richness of our differences.</p>
