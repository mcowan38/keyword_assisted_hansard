<p data-HoCid="8284511" data-originallang="en">Canada's long-standing, many-decades-long position has been to recognize the State of Israel, with which we've had diplomatic relations for decades. It's also been our long-standing position not to recognize the state of Palestine. We'll recognize that state if it culminates...as the result of negotiations between the State of Israel and the Palestinian people. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8284512" data-originallang="en">Does the Government of Canada believe it's time to change that long-standing position and immediately recognize the state of Palestine?</p>
