<p data-HoCid="7602275" data-originallang="en">We're going to have to, of course, go through all the old applications, new applications, the old contribution agreement, the new contribution agreement. I am, as I think we all are around this table, concerned about the length of time that this took. Really, essentially from the point of first clearly identifying the hateful anti-Semitism that was being funded by the federal government to actually ending the contract took over two months. With the rise of white supremacy, the rise in hate, we can't have a federal government that takes that long to respond to egregious cases of hate being disseminated whether that's online or any other venue. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7602276" data-originallang="en">When you talk about the measures that have been put into place, what are the measures that would mean that if something comes to light, if something is identified with the department or in the ongoing vetting that's taking place within the department, there can be a rapid end to that contract? The reality is that it undermines confidence in our federal government when we have federal government funds going to a person or an organization that is propagating vicious anti-Semitic comments and hateful messages.</p>
