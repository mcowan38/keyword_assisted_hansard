<p data-HoCid="8373178" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity today to speak to budget 2024 as I believe it presents a number of investments and initiatives critical to ensure that Canada keeps moving forward in difficult times.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373179" data-originallang="en"> We are living difficult times. Not only are Canadians dealing with a high cost of living, driven by a complex mix of global factors, but we are struggling with dramatically increasing costs of climate change and serious geopolitical upheaval, issues which are spilling over onto our own shores and deeply affecting our communities both directly and indirectly.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373180" data-originallang="en">This is happening as the income gap, more critically the purchasing power between the lowest income-earning households and the highest income quintiles, has continued to grow. That divide, whether economically, socially or as a measure of health, is not a good one.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373181" data-originallang="en">Recently I was talking with one of my constituents, who is based in Whitehorse. Even with a well-paying public service position and while owning a house, she described her struggle getting by from day to day: fuel costs, food costs and an upcoming mortgage renewal, with not a lot left over for extras.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373182" data-originallang="en">All Canadians at low and middle-incomes are feeling the strain, from deciding not to go on a family trip this year to not doing the Friday dinner date. It is those younger Canadians, millennial and gen Z, who are feeling the strain the most. In addition to being saddled with the cost of services for boomers and others as they age, our younger generations now are facing the unconscionable, perhaps unforgivable, debt of the cost of the climate crisis.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373183" data-originallang="en"> According to the Canadian Climate Institute's estimates, $89 billion will be added to our health care costs annually by mid-century. We could face $100-billion fall in annual GDP and the lowest income levels could drop by 25%.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373184" data-originallang="en">Yes, this budget carries costs, but those costs are investments in Canada and Canadians so that we can face the future with confidence, restore equity and avert the worst effects of climate change.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373185" data-originallang="fr">The cost of inaction will be far greater.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373186" data-originallang="en">Let us talk about investments.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373187" data-originallang="en"> We are implementing a clean electricity tax credit, the clean technology manufacturing tax credit, to allow companies and tax-exempt entities to invest in clean energy equipment, helping us not only to green our electricity systems but scale them up to meet the demand of zero emission in electric vehicles and support our provinces and territories in working toward net-zero grids.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373188" data-originallang="en"> We are investing in entrepreneurs, including more than $200 million for Canadian start-ups for equity deserving or underserved communities, which I know will give a boost to the many enterprising entrepreneurs who populate the communities across Yukon.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373189" data-originallang="fr">We are also further adapting the Canada growth fund, a fund worth over $6 billion for stakeholders looking to accelerate their investments in decarbonization and clean growth technologies. This is a crucial addition to our price on pollution to ensure that Canada can successfully reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373190" data-originallang="en">It is not only the cost of climate change that Canadians face. Far too many Canadians are housing insecure, which is why our budget launch is a bold strategy to unlock almost four million new homes by 2031. We are reintroducing a post-World War II-style design catalogue to speed up the building of good quality homes, including duplexes, triplexes and low and medium-density options. These will be coupled with an additional $15 billion to the apartment construction loan program, $1.5 billion to protect affordable rentals and a billion dollars for our affordable housing fund.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373191" data-originallang="en">Not only are we investing in good homes, a healthy environment and strong communities to raise our families, we are protecting our assets as well.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373192" data-originallang="en"> We have one of the longest coastlines in the world. We have a vital waterway over which we exercise our sovereignty, the Northwest Passage. Canada's north represents more than 40% of Canada's territory, located in an increasingly unstable world where major or emerging powers, friendly or unfriendly, are watching.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373193" data-originallang="en">While the north is experiencing some of the most dramatic effects of climate change, we are also just starting to tap into the north's huge potential in equitable economic and resource development, all while protecting an increasingly threatened landscape and advancing reconciliation and true partnership with indigenous citizens.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373194" data-originallang="en"> Building on our $40-billion investment to modernize NORAD, along with our American partners, budget 2024 begins to lay out further critically needed investments in defence and a defence policy update to chart the course to ensure our armed forces are ready for what the future will hold. This includes $8.1 billion to ensure Canada is ready to respond to global threats, including almost $2 billion to replenish supplies and equipment, and more than $500 million to replace satellite communications equipment critical for our future investments in new tactical helicopters and long-range missile capabilities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373195" data-originallang="fr">This is in addition to critical investments we have made to build new homes and renovate existing ones, to provide child care services to Canadian Armed Forces personnel and families on bases across the country, to increase the number of civilian specialists working to support DND operations, and to support their consolidation. We are also working on ways to improve retention as we modernize the forces.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373196" data-originallang="en">Part of that is recognizing the increasing risks cybersecurity threats pose to Canadians. I am pleased to see the importance of this work recognized in budget 2024, with a commitment of more than $900 million over the next five years to enhance intelligence in cyber-operations and to protect Canada's economic security from rapidly evolving security threats.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373197" data-originallang="en"> With a world that is increasingly connected online, the threats we face in the cyber realm are growing, not only to individual Canadians and our personal data and finances but to our country's critical infrastructure.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373198" data-originallang="fr">Our government is investing in our future and in defending that future, but we also want to support Canadians today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373199" data-originallang="en">We are investing $273.6 million for Canada's action plan to combatting hate, to support community outreach, law enforcement reform, tackle the rise in hate crimes, enhance community security and counter radicalization. This is alongside $7.3 million to address the rise in anti-Semitism and $7.3 million to address the rise in Islamophobia. Expressions of both have been rising for some years, but have broken out in a more ominous way since the onset of war in the Middle East.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373200" data-originallang="en">In addition to our government's historic investment in strengthening public health care over the past year, I am pleased to see our new national pharmacare plan announced, with $1.5 billion over five years to ensure its effective rollout, while providing, as first steps, support for reproductive health care and diabetes care.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373201" data-originallang="en">We are also addressing the critical needs of our communities in the ongoing overdose crisis, with $150 million through the emergency treatment fund.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373202" data-originallang="fr">We are also continuing to expand the Canadian dental care plan to cover more than nine million Canadians who currently do not have dental insurance, and we are investing an additional $1 billion to support affordable day care.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373203" data-originallang="en">It is not only day care that families need. I am looking forward to seeing our partners in Yukon work with our new national school food program to expand access to existing school food programs to those who need it, so no child has to go to school hungry.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373204" data-originallang="en">For students already on the pathway to a career, we are increasing student grants and loans, making it easier for the more than one million Canadian students to afford their desired education and get their start in life. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8373205" data-originallang="en">Teachers, social workers and more health care health care professionals, who have found new opportunities in our rural and remote communities, will now be a permanent part of the Canada student loan forgiveness program.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373206" data-originallang="en">New investments to boost research and innovation, including support for graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, will ensure Canada remains a world leader in science and new technologies like artificial intelligence.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373207" data-originallang="en">This budget is about ensuring that young people in particular, but all Canadians, have a chance to realize their dreams and aspirations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373208" data-originallang="fr">To deliver on all of the promises in the budget, we are asking some of the wealthiest Canadians to pay a little more for certain things, because in doing so, they are investing in their fellow citizens and in their country, and everyone benefits.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373209" data-originallang="en"> Pierre Poilievre and his Conservatives have already committed to voting against the budget. This means they will be voting against increased health care funding and—</p>
