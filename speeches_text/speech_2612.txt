<p data-HoCid="7957542" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, I was very concerned by what I heard before. The Jewish people were the victims of the greatest genocide in human history, the Holocaust. Israel is the only majority Jewish state in the world. It sounded to me very much like he accused the state of Israel of being on the verge of committing a genocide.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957543" data-originallang="en">I would like to ask, yes or no, do you believe that Israel is committing or is about to commit genocide?</p>
