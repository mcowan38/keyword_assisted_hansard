<p data-HoCid="8100419" data-originallang="en"> Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100420" data-originallang="en">I'd like to thank my colleague Mr. Moore for putting forward this motion. It is very important. It is also very timely. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8100421" data-originallang="en"> Number one looks at designating the IRGC as a terrorist entity under the Criminal Code and expelling the estimated 700 Iranian agents operating in Canada. These things have come up many times in the House, and I'm surprised that the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> hasn't acted on them yet. Even politically speaking, I'm surprised he wouldn't have acted on them. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8100422" data-originallang="en">I've been to a number of “Woman, Life, Freedom” rallies in downtown Vancouver, three or four of them, and every time they attract large numbers of people, primarily from the Iranian community throughout metro Vancouver. They're very motivated and they are very animated. They love their country. They love Iran. They just don't love the IRGC government that is running their country, and they're looking to Canadian politicians to support them in that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8100423" data-originallang="en">We have certainly shown that support as well as we can by showing up at the rallies and speaking and meeting people and talking with them and encouraging them, so politically it seems as though it would be a popular thing to follow through on what Mr. Moore has now put as number one on this motion. I'm surprised that nothing has happened about it yet.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100424" data-originallang="en">Second, it is very timely in the sense that, given the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack on innocent Israelis, the sense of discomfort and the sense of insecurity among the Jewish population here in Canada has spilled over, and we should be doing whatever we can to support them and to show them that they have a home here in Canada, that we support Israel. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8100425" data-originallang="en">I would point out that Israel is the only democratic nation in the middle of what is otherwise a pretty hostile region of the world—to them, anyway. It is a technologically advanced, industrialized nation, a country with which we can trade. We can support each other democratically and economically, and we need to show them that support in whatever way we can. I believe passing this motion would signal that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8100426" data-originallang="en">I also want to make the point about what I see as misplaced anger and frustration by some Canadian citizens in response to announcements a couple of years ago concerning unmarked graves at a former residential school in Kamloops. We all recognize that this is a black mark in our history. We also recognize that churches—the Catholic church and the Anglican church and others—have partnered with the Canadian government throughout our history to operate residential schools. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8100427" data-originallang="en">I understand as well how frustrating it has been for indigenous communities to learn about these unmarked graves. I've met with the Kwantlen First Nation people in my riding on several occasions, and I know that the pain is real and it all feels very recent. There are some elderly citizens who live there, who were survivors of residential schools, and I am deeply sympathetic to their concerns, but what I find frustrating is that frustration by some people in response to these historical truths has been misguided into attacking Christian churches. A number of churches were burned, some to the ground, and what I find really puzzling is that several of these churches were actually there to service indigenous communities, so burning them was of no help at all. Those doing that were not supporting indigenous communities at all. They were just hurting them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100428" data-originallang="en">I believe it's number five in the motion that speaks to that. I think it is a very timely motion. I commend my colleague for putting it forward, and I think we should all vote in favour of it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100429" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
