<p data-HoCid="7927961" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, on Friday, a Nazi received a standing ovation in the House. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7927962" data-originallang="en">Today is Yom Kippur. The Jewish community, my community, is horrified. Only one office in the country is responsible for vetting visitors to this place: the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>'s Office. When the Ukrainian president, a head of state, addresses the House during a time of war, the Prime Minister's Office is responsible for security, full stop. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7927963" data-originallang="en">This scandal is entirely on the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>'s Office. Either it vetted this Nazi and did not care or it did not vet him and is completely incompetent. Which is it?</p>
