<p data-HoCid="6278383" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, beginning last Friday, Jewish Canadians across the country have been celebrating Sukkot.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6278384" data-originallang="en"> During this time, we celebrate the gathering of the harvest and commemorate the 40 years the ancient Israelites wandered the desert after leaving Egypt. For eight days, Jews will gather in a sukkah, which is a hut that represents the temporary shelters used on the way out of Egypt. It is here where meals and prayers are shared throughout Sukkot to celebrate this joyous and festive occasion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6278385" data-originallang="en"> During this celebration, a bundle of different plants, known as the four kinds, is waved in different directions. They symbolize Jewish unity, demonstrating how the differing levels of knowledge and observance within the Jewish faith are united.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6278386" data-originallang="en"> Today, I wish the Jewish community across Canada celebrating Sukkot a Chag Sameach.</p>
