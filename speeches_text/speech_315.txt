<p data-HoCid="6325073" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I can share with my hon. colleague from <a data-HoCid="253019" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> that we are unfortunately in a red zone too. I wish her community well as we struggle to flatten the curve.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6325074" data-originallang="en">What I can tell colleagues is that we want programs that are efficient and targeted, especially toward our small and medium-sized enterprises, and programs that do not have a negative impact, such as some of the measures implemented by the Liberal government did.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6325075" data-originallang="en">I want to reassure my colleague that we want those measures. We want to support efficient measures for small and medium-sized enterprises. That is the goal of the motion today and why I seek support from other members. I can understand why my colleague from the other party will support it. I think it is a step in the right direction. We need to be there to help and support our small and medium-sized businesses without being a barrier for them, as they go through the pandemic.</p>
