<p data-HoCid="8245074" data-originallang="fr">Other witnesses have spoken about the rights of nature. One witness pointed out in fact that we can establish all kinds of rights, but they have to be upheld. As we are seeing right now, fundamental human rights are not being upheld, particularly in the Israel and Hamas war. It might be useful to establish all kinds of rights for nature, but there will have to be limits for the people who do not uphold them.</p>
