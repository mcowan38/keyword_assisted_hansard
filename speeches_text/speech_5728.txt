<p data-HoCid="8792622" data-originallang="fr">Ms. Dubuc, your opening remarks didn't focus directly on the subject of our study and contained very little information on the 2ELGBTQI+ community. Would you please have your organization provide the committee with a report on the training you provide for RCMP officers to improve their knowledge of that community?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8792623" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Madou, Ms. Gazan discussed the policy in the context of online messaging. Who are the players exerting influence in Canada? Is it Russia or China? Homosexuality is punished by the death penalty in some countries. What are the influencer countries when it comes to online hate speech in Canada?</p>
