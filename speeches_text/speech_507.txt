<p data-HoCid="6419752" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the member for <a data-HoCid="253019" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> for raising what she perceives is a carve-out for mental health. The challenge is this. Mental health can be approached with a psychiatry handbook and a recognized condition. Mental health can also be someone who is in depression in a grievous harmful situation, isolated in a pandemic, a senior who feels her or she is a burden on his or her family. That is why, going back to the Rodriguez and Carter decisions, which I would invite all members to read, including the <a data-HoCid="245292" href="/politicians/david-lametti/" title="David Lametti">Attorney General</a>, consent and capacity and 10-day review is to ensure there is no state-of-mind issue for someone is feeling coerced or vulnerable.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6419753" data-originallang="en"> Mental health is a part of the end-of-life decision, the stress and pain, all those considerations. That is why the Carter decision said that a carefully designed system of safeguards was critical. The government does not have that. We are asking for reasonable safeguards to protect our most vulnerable.</p>
