<p data-HoCid="8100432" data-originallang="en">First of all, I think a lot of these things are things we all agree on. There are things we already, on our side, said we were in support of too. For example, I already voted in the House to designate the IRGC a terrorist entity under the Criminal Code. I think Iran is one of the greatest dangers to the world, along with countries like North Korea. Iran is fomenting terrorism in the Middle East. It has a horrible record of abusing human rights and calling for the genocide of Jewish people and the state of Israel. Clearly, I support the IRGC being named a terrorist entity. If there are enemy agents of the Iranian government operating in Canada—I can't validate that there are 700, or whatever the number is—they should be expelled. There's no doubt about it. I have absolutely no problem with that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8100433" data-originallang="en">We've already said we want to establish a foreign influence registry. I think that's a very important thing to do. It should be done on a timely basis. We are constantly evaluating Canada's threat assessment, whether in light of the U.K. travel advisory or anything else. Canada would always be doing that. I strongly support that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8100434" data-originallang="en">Remove red tape and speed up access to the security infrastructure program. As soon as the attacks of October 7 happened, where the Hamas terrorist organization attacked our democratic ally Israel, there were threats to Jewish communities and institutions across the country, and threats to Muslim associations and others. <a data-HoCid="300017" href="/politicians/dominic-leblanc/" title="Dominic LeBlanc">Dominic LeBlanc</a> immediately acted and created a new round of funding that removes most of the red tape and speeds it up. Most people will get answers under the new program, once they apply, in a matter of weeks. It allows security guards to be included. No longer do you need to provide three competing quotes for many things. It was actually done. I support it, because we just did it. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8100435" data-originallang="en">Finally, on the anti-hate crime task force for communities across the country, local police often do not know how to deal properly with these issues. They need proper training and guidance on the Criminal Code. I think we should all be working together, across federal, provincial and municipal governments, to coordinate policing. Of course, as somebody who was in a building that had a Molotov cocktail thrown at it one and a half hours after he left—we'd posted on social medial; then that happened—I understand how communities throughout this country are terrorized and afraid. I have people in my riding who are afraid to send their kids to their schools. I have people in my riding who are afraid to go to campus wearing their Magen David. Again, I speak as somebody who is a member of the Jewish community and has a riding in which over 30% of the people are from the Jewish community. That's true of people in the small Muslim community in my riding. The mosques are worried, too. Ms. Dhillon was talking to me about how her Sikh community feels in certain parts of this country. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8100436" data-originallang="en">There is no harm in doing this. We should be doing more. In fact, one thing I say we're missing is having the administrators of colleges and universities as part of a task force with federal and provincial governments, in order to tell them how to quell hate on campus. That is something we should also be doing. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8100437" data-originallang="en">In any case, to be brief, I have no problem with this resolution. I'll vote in favour of it, because it's stuff we should be doing, end of story.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100438" data-originallang="en">Thanks.</p>
