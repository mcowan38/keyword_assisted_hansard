<p data-HoCid="7647057" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I am certainly not here to get down that rabbit hole on David Johnston, but I will make one thing clear: I do not recall anybody asking for a special rapporteur.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7647058" data-originallang="en">The hon. member suggests that it is our decision, but they have a decision they can make. They can call a public inquiry. They can allow an independent body to dig into this. They can have the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> commit to testifying at committee, if they believe in prime ministerial accountability, or they can have Telford testify.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7647059" data-originallang="en">Those three choices have been put on the table at the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. What will the government do and what will the hon. member have to say when this comes up tomorrow?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7647060" data-originallang="en">He had the choice, yet they chose not to take this action and instead appointed the special rapporteur that nobody in the House asked for.</p>
