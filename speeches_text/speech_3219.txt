<p data-HoCid="8114939" data-originallang="fr">Minister, I'd like to come back to the question of online harms. Last year, in 2022, multiple ideologically motivated killings in North America were carried out by right-wing extremists. We all saw it. We talked about homophobia, anti-Semitism, hate messages and racism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8114940" data-originallang="fr">All these online harms are still happening. Why is the government still waiting to take action? Why do we still not have a date for the introduction of this important bill?</p>
