<p data-HoCid="8679477" data-originallang="en">It's international law. That's very clear. That's the criterion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679478" data-originallang="en"> It certainly isn't democracy, because that's subjective among different states. All states agree that the governing principle of how they should relate to one another is international law. International law already determined that Palestine juridically exists. As I said, the 1933 Montevideo convention criteria are met, as recognized by 149 states.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679479" data-originallang="en">Canada just needs to exercise its political will to recognize that fact. </p>
