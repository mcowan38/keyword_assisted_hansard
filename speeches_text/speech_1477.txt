<p data-HoCid="7054740" data-originallang="en">Well, you know, in every war, information is key, because it justifies why you start war.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7054741" data-originallang="en">What we've seen since the beginning of this war...well, before the war there was a big propaganda campaign, because we were saying that there were troops that were getting organized around Ukraine, and Russia was saying, no, that's not the case. Clearly, they lied to our face and to the world.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7054742" data-originallang="en"> Afterwards, they said that the reason they were sending troops to further invade Ukraine was to denazify the country. Well, we know that Zelenskyy himself is Jewish. They were saying that in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions there was a genocide happening. This is not only patently false, but is clearly manipulation. Also, since then, they've been engaging in more and more of their propaganda.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7054743" data-originallang="en">Meanwhile, we know that it is happening in Ukraine and in Russia, but at the same time, it's happening in our democracies. We've banned RT and Sputnik on the broadcasting side. We've pushed digital platforms to also ban them, but we need to do more, and Canada is chairing two important coalitions this year: the Freedom Online Coalition and the Media Freedom Coalition. Our mandate, and my mandate as foreign minister, is really to counter propaganda online.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7054744" data-originallang="en">Social media companies need to do more. They need to make sure they recognize that states have jurisdiction over them, and that they're not technological platforms but content producers. It is our way, collectively, to make sure we are really able to have strong democracies in the future, because this war is being fought with 21st-century tools, including social media.</p>
