<p data-HoCid="8691905" data-originallang="en"> What I was saying at the beginning.... Obviously, the Liberals want to interrupt me. I get it. They don't want to hear this. They don't want this public. They don't want the record of their <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, who, quite frankly, most of them don't support.... All you have to do is go to question period and see the empty benches to see what's happening. That is the reality.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8691906" data-originallang="en">The tweet about “gagging” is so hypocritical when you have, literally, a guy.... This was the former parliamentary secretary to the Prime Minister, who was on record just days ago saying that this man is a full-blown narcissist and a dictator. That is what you're dealing with. Then, this Liberal member has the audacity to say that we're being gagged by our leader.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8691907" data-originallang="en">I want to talk about the bill at hand, because this comes back to the public safety crisis that's been created in this country under the Liberal and NDP coalition. The bill says this:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8691908" data-originallang="en"> This enactment amends the Criminal Code to prohibit a person from making, distributing or advertising pornographic material for commercial purposes without having first ascertained that, at the time the material was made, each person whose image is depicted in the material was 18 years of age or older and gave their express consent to their image being depicted. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8691909" data-originallang="en">That comes back to everybody asking, “What's the relevance of what you're talking about?” This is the justice committee, and the stats.... Just go outside. This is what I can't stress enough, Madam Chair. They've made their position clear on what they're trying to stop here, and it has nothing to do with justice being served in this country. It has nothing to do with the public safety crisis that has happened under the watch of <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Justin Trudeau</a> and his incompetent ministers. That is the reality of what we're saying. Trafficking in persons is up 84%. There is a direct link to all of this and to young men being exposed to pornography, so of course we want to study this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8691910" data-originallang="en">I'm going to come back to the anti-Semitism study: My colleague Mr. Brock put forward in a dilatory motion that we get back to studying this. Clearly, the Liberals have no interest in actually delving into the justice that has been destroyed in this country and the public safety that's been destroyed. I want to reiterate that, and I hope that we will have the support of the folks across the way, because we have two studies happening in this committee, on Islamophobia and on anti-Semitism, and clearly these members of Parliament, much like the whole Liberal caucus, are not talking to each other.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8691911" data-originallang="en">I will read this into the record: “New data reveals antisemitic hate crimes are up 400% after 9 years of Trudeau. 2/3 of all hate crimes are against Jews in Canada. When will Justin Trudeau finally take antisemitism seriously?”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8691912" data-originallang="en"> That is a direct tweet from my friend and colleague and fierce Jewish advocate <a data-HoCid="278781" href="/politicians/marty-morantz/" title="Marty Morantz">Marty Morantz</a>. That is what we would ask here today, to get to the dilatory motion of that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8691913" data-originallang="en">There is one final piece I want to leave on this, because I know there are a lot of victims and survivors watching at home. Mr. Maloney wrote a tweet, and he said, “My heart is with all the victims who are going through unimaginable pain. It's disgusting to see their tragedy used to score political points. We all need to work with law enforcement to prevent these crimes and support victims. This has nothing to do with 'Liberal policy.'”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8691914" data-originallang="en"> Well, Mr. Maloney, I'm not sure how long you've been here, but every single thing has to do with policy. That is the law, and that is politics. These politics and these policies, as you've heard directly from survivors, are killing women, children and innocent people on the street. For you to say, “This has nothing to do with 'Liberal policy'”, through you, Madam Chair, is shameful. It's shameful.</p>
