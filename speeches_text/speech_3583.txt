<p data-HoCid="8284535" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8284536" data-originallang="fr">Thank you to the Global Affairs Canada officials for being with us today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8284537" data-originallang="fr">We all understand that this is a war and that it's difficult. No war is easy, of course, but wars do have rules. One of the rules under the international conventions Canada is a signatory to stipulates that we must always protect civilians, innocent people. As you described so well, the current situation is inhumane. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of innocent people are dying every day in Gaza. That is unacceptable. Regardless of the situation, we all have an obligation to protect civilians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8284538" data-originallang="fr">Part of that means making sure that humanitarian aid is provided. That's what I want to ask you about. The U.S., along with the U.K. and other allies, announced its plans to set up a maritime corridor, but as you pointed out, the UN has said clearly that the best way to deliver humanitarian assistance is by truck. We know that the Netanyahu government is doing things that are blocking the delivery of the aid. Doesn't opening a maritime corridor overshadow the urgent need to push for the aid to be delivered by land?</p>
