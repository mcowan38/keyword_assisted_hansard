<p data-HoCid="7958563" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, Canada's Jewish community has been here since 1760. We have had high and low points in our history, but never in my lifetime has the 400,000 strong Jewish community in Canada felt so vulnerable. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7958564" data-originallang="en">The dramatic rise in anti-Semitism over the last decade has been compounded by Hamas terrorists brutally attacking our friend and ally Israel. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7958565" data-originallang="en">This week, hundreds of Jewish community leaders from across Canada are in Ottawa for a conference presented by CIJA, JFC-UIA and Canada's Jewish federations. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7958566" data-originallang="fr">They are here to speak directly to parliamentarians about the anti-Semitism that they face both online and in their communities, and to make important recommendations for action.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7958567" data-originallang="en">Tonight there is a reception at the Shaw Centre. I encourage each and every member of the House to join me there so we can show solidarity with the Jewish community at this difficult and emotional time.</p>
