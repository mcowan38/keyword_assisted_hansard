<p data-HoCid="6272432" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I am rising today to speak about the horrific crimes facing Uighur Muslims in China. More and more Canadians, and certainly parliamentarians, are becoming aware of the situation. We have clear evidence of Uighur Muslims in China being sent to concentration camps. One expert told the Subcommittee on International Human Rights that it is the largest mass detention of a minority community since the Holocaust.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6272433" data-originallang="en">This is a high-tech-enabled, systematic effort to destroy Uighur culture, Uighur faith and, indeed, Uighur people. We have seen evidence brought before the subcommittee and other fora, that what is happening includes a systemic effort to prevent births within the Uighur community through forced abortions, forced sterilization and forced insertion of IUDs. These horrific, unspeakable crimes that the Subcommittee on International Human Rights heard about are becoming more and more known around the world.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6272434" data-originallang="en">Canada has to act. Canada has a responsibility as a party to the international convention on the prevention of genocide, but also simply by virtue of the fact that we are all human beings. We have a responsibility to respond when we hear this information about these horrors being inflicted on Uighur Muslims in China.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6272435" data-originallang="en">I asked our <a data-HoCid="253367" href="/politicians/francois-philippe-champagne/" title="François-Philippe Champagne">foreign affairs minister</a> many times about this issue. I have asked him to name the crime and to commit to action, to recognize Canada's obligations under the genocide convention, to recognize a genocide when it is taking place and even to recognize the responsibility to protect in cases where there is credible evidence, even short of certainty. When there is credible evidence the genocide is taking place, Canada's obligations under that convention, in terms of a responsibility to protect vulnerable populations, are invoked. This is clear in terms of our international commitments.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6272436" data-originallang="en">However, Canada's <a data-HoCid="253367" href="/politicians/francois-philippe-champagne/" title="François-Philippe Champagne">foreign affairs minister</a> has always stopped short in terms of the response on these issues. He has told us that he is deeply disturbed, that he feels deeply in response to these events. He noted in response to my last question a declaration that he had co-signed, where he notes that he has consulted with various UN officials about if there might be opportunities to do more. He knows full well that his failure to recognize and respond in terms of a responsibility to protect and take real concrete action is missing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6272437" data-originallang="en">We will continue to call on the government out of a sense of our international obligations, but also out of a sense of basic human decency in recognizing the commitments we made after the Second World War, saying never again. We should make good on our commitments to ensure never again will we see a people face this kind of mass extermination effort that is going on right now in East Turkestan targeting Uighurs.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6272438" data-originallang="en">Our government needs to recognize the crime taking place. I asked the <a data-HoCid="253367" href="/politicians/francois-philippe-champagne/" title="François-Philippe Champagne">minister</a> if he would use the word “genocide” or would he use the words “crimes against humanity“, and we have not heard that recognition.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6272439" data-originallang="en">We need the government to be willing to use Magnitsky sanctions and impose real consequences through targeted sanctions against individuals involved in these vile atrocities. I know the government is capable of using the Magnitsky Act. They have used it in the case of Belarus, but they have yet to use it in the current case of what is happening to Uighur Muslims in China.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6272440" data-originallang="en">To the minister or whoever is answering on his behalf, will the Magnitsky sanctions be used? The <a data-HoCid="253367" href="/politicians/francois-philippe-champagne/" title="François-Philippe Champagne">minister</a> said a few months ago that it was on the table. It has been months and the atrocities are continuing. Will he use Magnitsky sanctions? We need to see reforms to our supply chains to ensure that we are not importing products made through Uighur slave labour. Will he take these concrete steps? Feelings are not enough. We need action in keeping with our international obligations.</p>
