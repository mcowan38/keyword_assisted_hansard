<p data-HoCid="6158682" data-originallang="en">Ms. Gazan, I'm going to interrupt. I'm sorry. A notice of motion is not debatable. We're moving on with the meeting at this point. We're also using up valuable time from some of our other questioners. We were going to be very nicely on time at one o'clock. Now we're a bit sidetracked, so I want to get us back on track.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6158683" data-originallang="en">Ms. Zann, you have five minutes. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
