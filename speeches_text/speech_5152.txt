<p data-HoCid="8679377" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Imseis, yesterday the Knesset banned the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, or UNRWA, from entering Palestinian territory.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679378" data-originallang="fr">First, can you explain the importance of UNRWA in the Palestinian territories?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679379" data-originallang="fr">Second, do you think this decision could speed up the process of making the occupied territories, particularly Gaza, completely uninhabitable, with the goal of ultimately turning it into a buffer zone that could be used for settlement?</p>
