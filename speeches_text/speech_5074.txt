<p data-HoCid="8639741" data-originallang="en"> Madam Speaker, you previously indicated that there is no limit on the scope of that. Your previous ruling was that a member not be interrupted during their question of privilege.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8639742" data-originallang="en">That same courtesy was not extended to me while expressing my concern about the anti-Semitism espoused by the member for <a data-HoCid="278641" href="/politicians/charlie-angus/" title="Charlie Angus">Timmins—James Bay</a> and, of course, the member for <a data-HoCid="278564" href="/politicians/frank-caputo/" title="Frank Caputo">Kamloops—Thompson—Cariboo</a>, looking for a House officer from the NDP to condemn that anti-Semitism, which he of course refused and failed to do.</p>
