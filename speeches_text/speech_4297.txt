It's a tool like any other. It isn't a demonic tool. It can be a very powerful one. Think about LGBTQ+ students on campus. What's happening, if they're Jewish, is that they have their Jewish identity, but they also have their queer identity. Those things should work beautifully together, and there should be places where they can strengthen each together.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435273" data-originallang="en"> What's happened is that they're excluded from progressive spaces. You're forced into a loyalty test of declaring you're not a Zionist and that you repudiate the State of Israel. We know these are the students who are facing real challenges in terms of their social integration and mental health. They are some very vulnerable students. They need all the support they can get. Their exclusion from those spaces is particularly painful and egregious.</p>
