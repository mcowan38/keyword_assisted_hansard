<p data-HoCid="7602537" data-originallang="en">I can assure you. On the work the department has done both to ensure that both official languages are respected and celebrated in the programming we do, and to ensure that anti-Semitism is combatted with the programming we do, whether it's the summit we had on anti-Semitism or round tables, we need to continue our efforts. We need to be vigilant. We understand that hate is going up and that anti-Semitism is an integral part of Canada's anti-racism strategy. We need to continue efforts to ensure it is understood in terms of how it is manifest in society, but also within our institutions. That is the work we are engaged in.</p>
