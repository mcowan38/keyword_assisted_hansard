<p data-HoCid="8760369" data-originallang="en"> I'm looking at this motion, and I want to make sure that we do the same practice that we have done in the past. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8760370" data-originallang="en"> I want to move an amendment, and forgive me, because I wasn't aware that the parliamentary secretary was going to move this motion today. I want to move an amendment that says, after the third line in the English, “for certain extended family affected by the crisis in Gaza;” add “, and Sudan”. Then it continues with a semicolon, and then I want to add another reference on the fourth line in the English version: After it says, “Government of Canada faces in facilitating the exit of Gazans” I would like to add the words “and Sudanese” before “and that Canada is not the only country that faces these challenges”. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8760371" data-originallang="en"> I would like Sudan to be included, as has been the practice of this committee in the two previous occasions that we've considered this. There's a large Sudanese community in Calgary, and I want to make sure that their views are reflected here. They've come to see me and they've come to see my colleague Greg McLean, and I want to make sure that their issues are also reflected in this study. </p>
