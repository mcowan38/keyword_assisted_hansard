<p data-HoCid="8028261" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8028262" data-originallang="en">I would simply offer an amendment to Mr. Julian's motion, an addition, which is that at the end of his motion, it would read:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8028263" data-originallang="en"> That the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage affirms that the CBC published a false headline based on disinformation from Hamas, a criminal terrorist organization, that incorrectly stated that Israel was responsible for the explosion at al-Ahli hospital in Gaza that resulted in the deaths of innocent civilians. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8028264" data-originallang="en"> And that, the committee call on the CBC to apologize to the Jewish community and all Canadians for spreading this dangerous disinformation and to publicly correct the record and to report this finding to the House of Commons. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8028265" data-originallang="en">I am happy to send that amendment to the clerk for it to be translated into French and made available to the members at the table.</p>
