<p data-HoCid="8794239" data-originallang="en">My final question is for Ms. Majid.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8794240" data-originallang="en">We know that recently Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, came to Canada. In an unprecedented move for a UN rapporteur, the Liberal <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> refused to meet with her. Senior representatives of Global Affairs Canada refused to meet with her. The foreign affairs committee of Parliament retracted an invitation for her to present. It's a clear reflection of the chilling effect, not just vis-à-vis somebody who is outspoken on what is happening in the occupied Palestinian territories and the presumed genocide, but also for an officer of the UN, a UN special rapporteur. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8794241" data-originallang="en">How troubling is it, and frankly unacceptable, that Canada showed this kind of response to a UN special rapporteur, somebody who is speaking out on what is happening to the Palestinians and Palestine?</p>
