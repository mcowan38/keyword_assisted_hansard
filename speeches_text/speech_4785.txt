<p data-HoCid="8548646" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to be back in the House after a productive summer in my riding of Mississauga—Erin Mills.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8548647" data-originallang="en"> Over the summer, I attended more than 100 events and met with 180 organizations and businesses from my riding to discuss the issues most important to them. We welcomed thousands of residents to my seventh annual Mississauga—Erin Mills barbecue. Our Women's Council and Youth Council hosted a health symposium, as well as a mental health panel, to highlight important issues that have an impact on the well-being of youth and women in our community. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8548648" data-originallang="en">I met with hundreds of residents to talk about important issues, such as housing and grocery prices. I hosted a round table discussion with Canadian Palestinians to listen to them and better understand their lived experiences with anti-Palestinian racism. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8548649" data-originallang="en">We have considerable work ahead of us on many important issues. I am looking forward to working with all members in the House to deliver for Canadians.</p>
