<p data-HoCid="8453970" data-originallang="en">Minister, Canada is known as a peaceful country. As a matter of fact, Canada created the peacekeeping force under Lester B. Pearson. I believe it should be respected in all countries during international conflicts.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8453971" data-originallang="en"> I have several cases in my riding that broke my heart. There are family members who are registered with our Canadian embassy in Egypt, but they cannot cross the border due to smugglers. They're being asked to pay $5,000 per person. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8453972" data-originallang="en">Can Canada intervene with both sides, Israel and Egypt, in order to put an end to those smugglers and facilitate the access of those people who are in need?</p>
