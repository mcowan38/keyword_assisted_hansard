<p data-HoCid="7548764" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, today I rise in the House to honour Ralph Schwartzman, who passed late last year. Ralph was a pillar of Vancouver's Jewish community. A builder for over 70 years, Ralph's contributions to the community were of many construction projects, including the Vancouver Talmud Torah school and the Temple Sholom synagogue in my riding of Vancouver Granville.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7548765" data-originallang="en"> Ralph was a kind and honest man, a true mensch. While family, friends, business associates and community mourn this loss, we celebrate the wonderful and charitable life he lived. His legacy will indeed live on through the JCC redevelopment, a symbol of our thriving community, a community he was devoted to building.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7548766" data-originallang="en">May his memory be a blessing and his kindness a lesson to us all.</p>
