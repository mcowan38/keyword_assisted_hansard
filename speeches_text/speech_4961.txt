<p data-HoCid="8595795" data-originallang="en"> Madam Speaker, I would also like to comment on the Iranian regime's role in fomenting violence in Sudan. Sudan is in the midst of the worst humanitarian crisis in a generation, and the Iranian regime's support for one of the belligerents fighting in that terrible civil war is contributing to the crisis. Estimates are that over 2.5 million people will die in Sudan this year. To put that in perspective, that is more than the entire population of the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8595796" data-originallang="en">The horrors in Sudan and how other actors are fuelling that conflict desperately need more attention from the House, from the government and from governments throughout the world. This is another example of the Iranian regime's sowing violence and discord around the world. The member mentioned that six years after the House voted to list the IRGC as a terrorist organization, the Liberals finally did it. My question is simple: Why did it take so long? </p>
