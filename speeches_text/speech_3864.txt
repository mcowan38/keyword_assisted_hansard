<p data-HoCid="8301052" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair. I, too, would like to commend Mr. Housefather for his tireless work against anti-Semitism and bringing the attention of this committee and all of Parliament to the rise of anti-Semitism. I have seen the evidence of this in my own constituency and again on campus at two educational institutions that I've been long associated with in my community. Jewish students have approached me saying they no longer feel safe just being on campus, not in doing anything on campus, and I have an extreme level of concern about this. I am completely supportive of this study.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301053" data-originallang="en">However, I take very seriously what Mr. Housefather said about leadership, and a necessity for providing leadership, so I am going to propose an amendment to his motion, not to diminish in any way the study of anti-Semitism, but for our committee to provide the same leadership with the parallel rise of Islamophobia in this country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301054" data-originallang="en">On my proposed amendment, I have a text in both official languages. I will read the technical...and we have a version as it would read. I think my staff will give it to the clerk at this point.</p>
