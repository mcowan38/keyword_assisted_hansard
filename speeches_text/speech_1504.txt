<p class="procedural" data-HoCid="6997751"> moved for leave to introduce Bill <a data-HoCid="11527269" href="/bills/44-1/C-256/">C-256, An Act to amend the Financial Administration Act (composition of boards of directors)</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6997752" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce an important bill to Parliament. This legislation would amend the Financial Administration Act to require gender parity on the board of directors of Crown corporations and agencies.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6997753" data-originallang="en">I would like to thank the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> for seconding this bill and for her tireless advocacy for gender equality.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6997754" data-originallang="en">Today in Canada, women make up only 27% of federal appointments to Crown corporation boards. Only 18% of director seats are held by women across all corporate boards in Canada, and 61% of boards are composed entirely of men. This is unacceptable and must change. By adopting this legislation, the federal government can lead by example and take concrete action to advance gender equality in Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6997755" data-originallang="en">For systemic change to occur, we must change the system. I hope all parliamentarians will support this important and overdue initiative.</p>
