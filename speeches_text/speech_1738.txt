<p data-HoCid="7205080" data-originallang="en">Thank you so much for your question. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7205081" data-originallang="en">I can give a brief review of the UGC numbers and then also give you some comments on the legacy media, which is, as was mentioned earlier this morning, performing marvellously. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7205082" data-originallang="en">Here's this Watchtime report. I really, truly wish you would all read it because there are 50 data charts in here. The bottom line is that Canada is the number one for exporters on the entire platform. We did quite a conservative evaluation. All the methodology is described in the report. In the 15 brief years of YouTube's existence, there are already 30,000 full-time jobs for Canadians and 160,000 Canadian entrepreneurs who are trying to make it without any public investment.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7205083" data-originallang="en">Going over the the legacy side, as was reviewed this morning by Dr. Geist, you've heard about record TV employment thanks to these global platforms. You've also heard of shows like Denmark's <em>Borgen</em>, Israel's <em>Fauda</em> and South Korea's <em>Squid Game</em>. I wanted to add that small countries like ours are really killing it on the global stage today because they have done the policy work that we really need to get CRTC to focus on. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7205084" data-originallang="en">Language is not a barrier. Competition is rising and it is imperative that we update and innovate our own policy because streamers really need content that will make it on the global stage. </p>
