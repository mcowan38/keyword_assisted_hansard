<p data-HoCid="8823580" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Chair, the Conservative Party of Canada, under the leadership of <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">Pierre Poilievre</a>, has voted against $274 million to combat hate in this country. They voted against $25 million for a new Montreal Holocaust museum; $5 million for the first-ever national Holocaust remembrance program; funding for a Holocaust education centre, something that the communities have asked for; and enhanced security measures for synagogues in this country. They voted against every single one of those. Shame on them.</p>
