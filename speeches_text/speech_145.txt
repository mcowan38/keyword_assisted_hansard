<p data-HoCid="6194238" data-originallang="en"> I believe your question is with regard to uranium prices in the current situation. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6194239" data-originallang="en">We're watching the uranium price very carefully. We've said all along that for our operations to come back to existence—if you want to call it that—we need long-term contracts to be ready to do that. We had to make difficult decisions to bring down our operations like McArthur River, Key Lake and Rabbit Lake in past years because the market wasn't where it needed to be for us to sustain those operations. We are hopeful that we'll see, for example, McArthur River and Key Lake come back. We're hopeful that we'll see Cigar Lake come back. However, we need not only the short-term spot-price market to rise, we need long-term contracts with partners. Those will then allow us to bring so many of our indigenous community partners back with us. We're very proud of our indigenous employment record, but we're just as proud of our indigenous record with our contractors.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6194240" data-originallang="en">We would like to see that price rise, just like so many others would, so we can see all those people return to work, but right now it's not where we need it to be. I wish I could tell you when it would return, but I don't have that crystal ball at the moment.</p>
