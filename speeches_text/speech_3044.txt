<p data-HoCid="8010750" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, my question is why the <a data-HoCid="299999" href="/politicians/arif-virani/" title="Arif Virani">Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada</a> is not acting, taking action to ensure that our hate laws are being upheld. These hate propaganda laws already exist. They can be found in sections 318 and 319 of the Criminal Code of Canada. If the government feels existing laws are insufficient, then let us get to work. Let us create a new criminal offence that specifically targets the glorification of terrorism. Such a call has already been made by B'nai Brith Canada. This will send a strong and very clear message that such behaviour, whether targeted against Jews or any other community, will not be tolerated in our country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8010751" data-originallang="en">Canadians support the rule of law, not mob rule. Will the Liberal government stand up to escalating violence and anti-Semitism or does someone really have to get hurt before it finally acts?</p>
