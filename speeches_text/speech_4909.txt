<p data-HoCid="8576700" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I have a question for the member opposite about the arms embargo she would like to see placed on Israel. If she is calling for this, it must be her position that everybody should put an arms embargo on Israel, which would leave Israel exposed and open to attack from its adversaries. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8576701" data-originallang="en">Is that the way the member would like to see the world go, to have no arms in Israel so that it cannot defend itself?</p>
