<p data-HoCid="8576460" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the federal government should show leadership in tackling the heinous rise in anti-Semitism in our country, in tackling the disorder in our public spaces and our streets that is targeting Jews, synagogues and Jewish institutions such as schools. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8576461" data-originallang="en">I believe the <a data-HoCid="300017" href="/politicians/dominic-leblanc/" title="Dominic LeBlanc">public safety minister</a> should convene a federal-provincial Solicitors General meeting in order to come to agreement among the 10 provinces and the federal government that directives will be issued, of general application to law enforcement in this country, that laws will be enforced against those who would use public disorder in our streets to target the Jewish community. That is the kind of leadership I would expect from a Government of Canada, and leadership I am convinced would be in place if Conservatives form the next government. </p>
