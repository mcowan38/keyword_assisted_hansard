<p data-HoCid="8693511" data-originallang="en"> I call this meeting to order. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693512" data-originallang="en">Welcome to meeting number 124 of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693513" data-originallang="en">Today's meeting is taking place in a hybrid format. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693514" data-originallang="en">All witnesses have completed the required connection tests in advance of our meeting.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693515" data-originallang="en"> I'd like to remind all witnesses, and all of the members here, to wait until I recognize them by name. For those members, should you have any technical challenges or questions, please raise your hand if you're joining us virtually. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693516" data-originallang="en">Pursuant to Standing Order 108(2) and the motion adopted by the committee on Thursday, September 19, 2024, the committee is resuming its study of Canada's advancement of a two-state solution. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693517" data-originallang="en">Before we welcome our witnesses, as you will note, our old clerk is back. It's great to have you back, Ms. Widmer. I know I speak on behalf of everyone when I say that we're very happy to see you here today. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693518" data-originallang="en">That said, we're very grateful to have two witnesses for the first 35 minutes. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693519" data-originallang="en">We're grateful to have Mr. Eugene Kontorovich, who is the executive director for the Center for the Middle East and International Law, as well as Mr. Eylon Levy, who is a former spokesman for the Israeli government. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693520" data-originallang="en">We will start with Mr. Kontorovich. You will have five minutes, sir, after which we will go to Mr. Levy, and then we will open it to questions from the members. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693521" data-originallang="en">I should warn you beforehand, since you're joining us virtually, if you do see this signal going up, it means that you should be wrapping it up within 30 seconds. We have a tight schedule here, and we want to make sure that people don't go over the allotted time. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693522" data-originallang="en">All of that having been explained, Mr. Kontorovich, the floor is now yours. You have five minutes for your opening remarks. </p>
