<p data-HoCid="8481650" data-originallang="en"> Ms. DeLaronde, I'd like to start with you, if I could, please. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8481651" data-originallang="en">It was in May of last year that the House of Commons unanimously adopted a motion introduced by my caucus colleague <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Leah Gazan</a>, which called on the federal government to declare the continued loss of indigenous women, girls, two-spirit and gender-diverse people a Canada-wide emergency and also to provide immediate and substantial investments, including to establish a red dress alert system. I want to credit my colleague for her drive in getting that into this budget.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8481652" data-originallang="en">What impact do you expect the red dress alert system will have on the safety of indigenous women, girls, two-spirit and gender-diverse people, and how rapidly should this pilot program be expanded across the country, in your view?</p>
