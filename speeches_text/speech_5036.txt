<p data-HoCid="8652983" data-originallang="en">I can take that question, as we're working together.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8652984" data-originallang="en">One of the big issues is how differently breast cancer plays out for different populations. It was interesting to hear the presentation from the Quebec Breast Cancer Foundation towards a more targeted approach, because that's where our understanding is going as well, specifically because different ethnic backgrounds play into breast cancer risk. It was already known that it was the case for Ashkenazi Jewish women. Now there's such a big, urgent health care “crisis”, I'd call it, regarding Black women and breast cancer. They really need to be around this table. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8652985" data-originallang="en">There are Black women breast cancer researchers who are calling it urgent that we get race-based data and to better understand it. Black women have historically been marginalized in many different ways, including with clinical trials. The percentage of Black women who've been part of clinical trials has been less than 1%. Researchers theorize that it's one of the reasons that it's becoming very clear that certain therapies don't work for them the way they work for white women.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8652986" data-originallang="en">There are layers to this issue. Breast cancer is a harrowing disease. We know that as well as anyone else here. It's wretched. Seeing anyone die from this is terrible. Overdiagnosis, where we turn healthy women into breast cancer patients, is an equally important problem that needs to be taken very seriously. No one who's been through breast cancer would want that. We need to start targeting. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8652987" data-originallang="en">As we said, race is a question that we need data on. It's the same thing for indigenous women. We need a lot more data on what's happening for indigenous women as well. Research out of Alberta indicates that their breast cancer incidence is going up. Do they respond to therapies late? Obviously, there are diagnoses at later stages. Do they respond to the same therapies? Then there are the historical problems in terms of how they are treated within the health care system.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8652988" data-originallang="en">There are layers to the problem and they require many perspectives. They require these women, and groups that work with them, to be around the table as well.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8652989" data-originallang="en"> Thank you.</p>
