<p data-HoCid="8576845" data-originallang="fr">Madam Speaker, I have a question for my colleague, who is a member from Montreal.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576846" data-originallang="fr">In Montreal, there have been many acts of terrorism against the Jewish community in recent weeks and months. How can the member explain his government's ambiguous position when it comes to standing up for Montreal's Jewish community?</p>
