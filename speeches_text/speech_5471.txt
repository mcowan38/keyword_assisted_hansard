<p data-HoCid="8714895" data-originallang="fr">Last May, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution by 143 votes in favour, 9 against and 25 abstentions, including Canada, in which the assembly expressed its conviction that the State of Palestine met all the conditions required for membership of the United Nations. The previous panel mentioned these conditions. In a World Affairs press release, Canada cited a number of reasons for its abstention. Curiously, it referred to illegal settlements and settler violence in the West Bank, which is increasing at an alarming rate and often with impunity; it also referred to the fact that Benjamin Netanyahu has made it clear, both in his words and actions, that he rejects the two-state solution.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714896" data-originallang="fr">On the substance, does Palestine meet the conditions to be recognized as a state?</p>
