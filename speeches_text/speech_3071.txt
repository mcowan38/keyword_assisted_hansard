<p data-HoCid="8053961" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. With respect, I think if you examine the proceedings today, you will see that the point of order raised by the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> is about the use of the term “crazy”, referring to someone's mental health as a pejorative.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8053962" data-originallang="en">It does not matter who it is applied to in this House. Her point of order was about the use of that term as a pejorative. I think you, Mr. Speaker, may have inadvertently confirmed that negative term in your ruling.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8053963" data-originallang="en"> I would like the Speaker to examine those records, because I think we need to make sure that in this House, we respect all those Canadians who are struggling with mental health issues and not use mental health as a pejorative in this House.</p>
