<p data-HoCid="8557131" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, Canada is following closely the situation between Israel and Lebanon, both because of the danger of escalation in the region and because of the high number of Canadians in Lebanon. As we have said since October, Canadians should avoid all travel to Lebanon, and Canadians in Lebanon should book a commercial flight to leave the country. No country or nation stands to gain from any further escalation. </p>
