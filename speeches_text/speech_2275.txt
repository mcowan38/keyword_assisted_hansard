<p data-HoCid="7727739" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Ms. Gazan.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7727740" data-originallang="en">Before I open the floor for debate, if NDP-2, the amendment moved by Madam Gazan, is adopted, then CPC-2 cannot be moved due to a line conflict. Both amendments seek to modify lines 10 on page 5.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7727741" data-originallang="en">Is there any discussion on Madam Gazan's amendment?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7727742" data-originallang="en">Madam Saks.</p>
