<p data-HoCid="6825142" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, on August 3, 2014, the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> publicly committed that he would support a humanitarian initiative led by Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish named Heal100Kids, to get 100 Palestinian children from Gaza to Canada for medical treatment. Since then, the Liberal government has ignored repeated requests for follow-up and help. This type of inaction and broken promises, saying one thing to get elected and then not following through afterward, is something that Canadians have seen time and time again from the current Liberal government.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6825143" data-originallang="en">When will the government stop ignoring Dr. Abuelaish's request for help and follow through on the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>'s own commitment to provide these children with the assistance they need?</p>
