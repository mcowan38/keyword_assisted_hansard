<p data-HoCid="8453988" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8453989" data-originallang="fr">Minister, since December 22, I've been dealing with a case of Gazan nationals who have an acquaintance in Ontario. I spoke with a Conservative MLA who represented the riding there, but nothing has changed. I even spoke to an Ontario Liberal MLA who is more pro-Palestinian than not, but nothing is moving. This morning, your office called me. Perhaps that has something to do with your presence here today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8453990" data-originallang="fr">I'm working on a case that you have been aware of since December 22. We are now in the month of May and have only just received the unique reference codes under the special measures program for extended family members in Gaza.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8453991" data-originallang="fr">Why has it been taking so long? It's all very well to raise the ceiling, but things need to move much more quickly. People are being bombed right now.</p>
