<p data-HoCid="8628312" data-originallang="en">The minister said in her opening remarks that we cannot allow hate to go unchecked, so I'd like to ask her if she joins me in unequivocally condemning the Samidoun protests on October 7 in Vancouver, where there were chants of, “death to Canada, death to the United States and death to Israel”, and even the burning of the Canadian flag.</p>
