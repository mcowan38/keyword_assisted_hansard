<p data-HoCid="7125259" data-originallang="en"> Madam Chair and members of the committee, thank you for this opportunity.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125260" data-originallang="en">I confess that I've never found throughout history that there was a solution that was presented by anyone and that was accepted totally as to how to eradicate hate. I certainly know that it cannot be removed by words, nor can it be removed by bullets and bombs. It will certainly be addressed by good education, good wisdom. In the world that we live in, we need political will with wisdom, laws to be followed, and I think, most importantly, we need education for our general society.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125261" data-originallang="en">I'm here today because we Hindus support any laws that will make it clear that people who go against the law of mankind and promote hate of any form must be addressed by the law of the land. Every effort must be made to refine the law to address these issues however they may be concealed, or be attempted to be concealed, under different emblems.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125262" data-originallang="en">I have a particular concern that the term “swastika” has been used very, very grossly across the meeting today. This country must be educated to understand that when we use that term “swastika”, we are talking about Sanskrit terminology. It was not something that belonged to Germany. The <em>hakenkreuz</em> is the term that Hitler intended for Nazism, and we would like to see that terminology used when referring to that emblem at all times. When you refer to it as a Nazi symbol and use “swastika”, you're offending the Hindu community and you're creating a form of Hinduphobia. We Hindus are affected by this tremendously.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125263" data-originallang="en">We agree with new laws, but we want you to be very cautious. We want to caution lawmakers that when they come to set laws in place, that implementation is a key factor. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7125264" data-originallang="en">I want to use a reference with respect to all and with no disrespect to anyone. When the same-sex law was made, Parliament agreed on it and on the implementation. Those who perform marriage ceremonies, as I do, came to the sad recognition that the marriage certificate no longer refers to bride and groom; it says applicant and applicant. We implemented a law to give someone a benefit and took away a value that others consider very valuable, one whereby bride and groom are considered.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125265" data-originallang="en">My caution to this committee and to the lawmakers is that when you decide on this law, be conscious.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125266" data-originallang="en"> I have a statement I would like to read. Hopefully the time will permit it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125267" data-originallang="en">As Parliament considers Mr. Julian's bill, Bill <a data-HoCid="11471425" href="/bills/44-1/C-229/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (banning symbols of hate)">C-229</a>, an act to amend the Criminal Code banning symbols of hate, it must make sure that the context of the use of the Nazi swastika is carefully considered. We cannot allow a Hindu emblem of goodness to be erased as we take steps together to stamp out hate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125268" data-originallang="en"> The bill, which we support, should be amended to ensure that a proper use of swastika for religious purposes by Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Zoroastrians is protected, celebrated and remains completely legal in Canada. It should be amended to clarify that the evidence demonstrates that Nazi <em>hakenkreuz</em> is a weapon of hate, not a matter of free expression. Whatever the political events of the day, it is absolutely possible—indeed, essential—to combat Jew hatred while ensuring the rights of Hindu, Buddhist, Jain and Zoroastrian Canadians and respecting their benevolent and sacred symbols. Let us together take the steps to celebrate our religious freedom and unity in confronting Nazism, or any form of hate that is projected by any group in any form.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125269" data-originallang="en">Today the statistics tell us that hate crimes are growing, while violent crimes or other crimes are diminishing. It tells us what our society is facing. With the demographic change, and as Canada opens its doors to more immigrants, we the lawmakers, we the politicians, we the people need to be conscious that the terms we use and the banners we stand under have an impact on the people who may be newcomers or residents of this country, and we need to protect all equally at all times.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125270" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
