<p data-HoCid="7931357" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister did not call Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He said he went through diplomatic channels. He did not call a meeting with Canada's Jewish community. Three days have gone by. What has the Prime Minister been doing for the past three days?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7931358" data-originallang="fr">The Prime Minister usually churns out one apology after another, but this time, it took five days. He could have been coordinating an effort to fight Russian propaganda but no, he was doing nothing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7931359" data-originallang="fr">Is he going to make another statement tomorrow to tell us what he did or did not do today, without doing it?</p>
