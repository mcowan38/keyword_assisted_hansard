<p data-HoCid="7993489" data-originallang="en"> I wrote down the word as she used it and I think the record stands. People are seeing in the committee what she said and how I've responded.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7993490" data-originallang="en"> There is a fundamental problem of disinformation. I think CBC endeavours to show the highest journalistic standards. I think it's important that we do bring both the CBC ombudsman and the director of journalistic standards before committee. As Mr. Champoux mentioned, it's important in a difficult, troubling time like this to have the CBC respond to us and answer those important questions, but there are broader concerns about rampant disinformation, and they don't come from the CBC. They come from the Meta corporation. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7993491" data-originallang="en">As you know, Madam Chair, both the European community and American lawmakers have cited Meta for rampant disinformation around the Israel-Hamas conflict. It is incumbent on us, I think, to subpoena Meta and bring Rachel Curran here to answer those questions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7993492" data-originallang="en"> I'll quote the following for the record before I offer my amendments.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7993493" data-originallang="en"> U.S. Senator Michael Bennet has said in referring to Meta—and, of course, Google and X or Twitter—“In many cases, your platforms’ algorithms have amplified this content, contributing to a dangerous cycle of outrage, engagement, and redistribution.” The senator's comments and those from from U.S. lawmakers come after European Union industry chief Thierry Breton blasted those same companies, Meta particularly, demanding that they take stricter steps to battle disinformation amid the escalating conflict. What we have is the European Union and U.S. lawmakers bringing bearing down on Meta particularly. As we know, the EU has issued warnings demanding that Meta do something to combat illegal content and disinformation. If not, they could potentially face harsh regulatory penalties.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7993494" data-originallang="en"> Madam Chair, that disinformation causes profound concerns. The reality is that both Meta and Google, as the parliamentary library and the Parliamentary Budget Officer have revealed, receive over a billion dollars in indirect taxpayer subsidies every year. The federal government pays the companies in order to advertise on Meta and Google. They have a public responsibility with that massive indirect subsidy that comes from taxpayers to combat disinformation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7993495" data-originallang="en"> What I offer as an amendment to the motion is the following.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7993496" data-originallang="en"> The first paragraph would read as written, the second paragraph would read as written, the third bullet point would be replaced entirely by “That both the European Union and U.S. lawmakers have raised concerns about false and misleading content about the Israel-Hamas conflict being spread on Meta platforms”. The fourth bullet point would be amended in the following way: “The CBC receives $1.4 billion in public funding, and Meta and Google receive over $1 billion in indirect subsidies annually”, and then it would read “through taxpayer dollars annually, and that this committee has a mandate to review Government expenditures”. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7993497" data-originallang="en"> Then, the (a) and (b) of “The Committee” would be replaced with “That the Committee subpoena Rachel Curran, head of public policy of Meta Canada, to come before the Committee”, and then (c) and (d) would read in the following way: “Invite the CBC Director of Journalistic Standards, George Achi, and the CBC ombudsman, Mr. Jack Nagler, to appear before the committee to address the CBC's position on Journalistic Standards and Practices”. </p>
