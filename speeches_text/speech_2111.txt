<p data-HoCid="7602243" data-originallang="en">Let me just mention this because it was important. My friend, Mr. Julian brought it up. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7602244" data-originallang="en">The Jerusalem declaration is a competing definition of the IHRA definition. The IHRA definition was developed by many countries, including Canada, over 10 years to come to a consensus definition of anti-Semitism. The Jerusalem declaration was developed by eight people.
