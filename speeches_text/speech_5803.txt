<p data-HoCid="8770356" data-originallang="en"> I find it very concerning that members are attempting to claim that, because someone who is of a Jewish faith was in a building where there was a protest by people who call themselves Jews Against Genocide, there is somehow an anti-Semitic threat. This is really taking us down a dark path.</p>
