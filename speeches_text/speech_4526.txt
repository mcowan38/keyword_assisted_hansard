<p data-HoCid="8451139" data-originallang="en">Thank you. I do want to speak to the amendment. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8451140" data-originallang="en">Obviously, we're very clear in our intent that the problem here is that the anti-racism strategy makes no reference to anti-Palestinian racism. This is not acceptable, in our view. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8451141" data-originallang="en">We look forward to having the <a data-HoCid="300016" href="/politicians/kamal-khera/" title="Kamal Khera">minister</a> in front of us to explain why this is the case, and certainly with the hope of the department and the Government of Canada changing course and being clear that anti-Semitism and anti-Palestinian racism, as well as other forms of hate, are part of the upcoming anti-racism strategy. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8451142" data-originallang="en">I will be voting against this amendment.</p>
