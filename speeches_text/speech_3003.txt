<p data-HoCid="7996066" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, more than 400 Canadians are trapped in Gaza, including Ahmed Alheluo of Edmonton, who is recovering from surgery and unable to transport himself. First, he was told by Canadian authorities to stay where he is, then to evacuate to Rafah, then to stay put again as Canadians may not be allowed to cross into Egypt. While the government ignores calls for a ceasefire, Ahmed is struggling to survive, and today we have learned that not a single Canadian is on the evacuation list.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7996067" data-originallang="en">Why is Canada not advocating for the lives of Canadians in Gaza, and when will the Liberals call for a ceasefire?</p>
