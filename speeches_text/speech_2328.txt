<p data-HoCid="7722871" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Your Excellency.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7722872" data-originallang="en">With the short amount of time I have left, I'd like to give you an opportunity to advise our committee as to what additional defence materials Ukraine may need. Of course, our Leopards have arrived and you articulated very well the extent of Canadian support in providing artillery and other defence equipment to Ukraine.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7722873" data-originallang="en">Perhaps I could also mention that it's very important to the Jewish community that I represent in Outremont that over the course of Passover everybody in our community enjoyed Ukrainian matzo. You mentioned that Ukraine continues to produce grain, and that is something that the Jewish community here in Canada feels is incredibly important to support and has celebrated. I wanted to let you know that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7722874" data-originallang="en">Perhaps I could turn it over to you on the defence question. </p>
