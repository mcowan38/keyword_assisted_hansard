<p data-HoCid="7957773" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his speech. We have worked together on a number of human rights issues, and that is exactly what we are doing again this evening.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957774" data-originallang="fr">I might disappoint some people this evening and this might sound glum, but I doubt there are many people in Israel or Palestine who are watching us right now. I am trying to determine what we can actually do, what impact we can really have on what is happening right now. One thing is possible. Canada could exert pressure to create humanitarian corridors. I truly believe that this could be possible if my colleague's government were prepared to take action. I am sure my friend would like to see that happen.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957775" data-originallang="fr">Does he know whether that is happening? If not, will my colleague put pressure on his own government to make it happen?</p>
