<p data-HoCid="6380880" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I too would like to congratulate the member for <a data-HoCid="252554" href="/politicians/john-barlow/" title="John Barlow">Foothills</a> on his excellent private member's bill.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6380881" data-originallang="en">Before I get into the heart of my speech, there are a couple of arguments that I think are misplaced. Quite frankly, I am a bit frustrated, as over the last couple of days I have been involved in private member's bills that were designed to help the agriculture industry, and we have received support and constructive feedback from both the Bloc Québécois as well as the NDP. I have to say I am a little disappointed in the Liberal Party and in its response to our supporting rural agriculture.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6380882" data-originallang="en">Specifically, I would like to address a couple of things that have come up. One is that this is absolutely an area of federal jurisdiction. It is co-jurisdiction, but the federal government has the right. Currently in some of the provincial legislation that would attempt to prevent some of the conduct that is contemplated in this legislation, some of the penalties are less than stringent. Therefore, this federal legislation, which is definitely within the jurisdiction, is also warranted.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6380883" data-originallang="en">Secondly, the member for <a data-HoCid="252507" href="/politicians/kody-blois/" title="Kody Blois">Kings—Hants</a> brought up the idea that maybe animal activists will not know about this law, and asked how we could put this law in place. The reality is that there is an old common-law principle that is hundreds of years old that says ignorance of the law is not an excuse. We must be aware of the law. It is part of being a citizen of a country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6380884" data-originallang="en">Finally, the other subject he brought up was the idea that, and he did ask it earnestly and I do respect that, whether for one of these biosecurity lapses, protestors had created an outbreak or the spread of a disease, and whether there was evidence of this. I would say, respectfully, to him that before COVID there was no COVID. Before the Holocaust there was no Holocaust. We need to get ahead of things; we cannot stay behind them. The reality is that, whether this has occurred in the past or not, there is the very real opportunity for this to occur, which it appears all parties acknowledge. Therefore, we need to be ahead of these things, not behind them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6380885" data-originallang="en">At this point, I would like to get into the meat of my speech. I can say with great pride that I am the member of Parliament for Northumberland—Peterborough South, a predominantly rural riding where we have, I believe, some of the best farmers in our country. I am honoured to rise in the House for the second time this week to speak in support of the amazing hard work farmers do across Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6380886" data-originallang="en">Canadians should all be proud of the amazing work our agriculture sector does. We have incredibly difficult and stringent regulations, which farmers across our country meet every day to make sure that Canadians have the safest, most secure food supply in the world. Whether it be growing grain on the Prairies, produce out in the beautiful province of British Columbia or raising livestock in my province of Ontario, Canadians can rest assured that every step is being taken by our farmers to make sure that food is safe and secure.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6380887" data-originallang="en">We have talked about biosecurity in Canada, but I would just like to take a half-step back and explain, at least in accordance with the Province of Ontario, what biosecurity is. Biosecurity is defined at the farm level as a management practice enabling producers to prevent the movement of disease-causing agents onto and off of agricultural operations. This includes environmental contamination. Biosecurity, therefore, involves many aspects of farm management, such as disease control and prevention, closed-herd vaccination, nutrient management and visitor control. Although controlling and limiting the movement of livestock is recognized as the most important biosecurity measure for most diseases, many important hazards can be carried on contaminated clothing, boots, equipment and vehicles.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6380888" data-originallang="en">While many people outside of the agricultural industry may not yet be aware of the issue of biosecurity, it has become a major concern within the industry as a result of the foreign and emergent diseases that are increasing public concerns over food safety and the globalization of agriculture.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6380889" data-originallang="en">I would like to comment on the question addressed by the member for <a data-HoCid="252554" href="/politicians/john-barlow/" title="John Barlow">Foothills</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6380890" data-originallang="en">There is unfortunately a divide between rural and urban Canada. Hopefully this speech and legislation helps to bridge it. As someone who is in rural Canada, I invite every member of Parliament, whether Liberal, NDP or Green, to come out to rural Canada. I would be happy to show everyone around my farm and the farms in my area. We would, of course, abide by all appropriate measures.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6380891" data-originallang="en">The concerns of biosecurity will only grow as we have greater farm and population density. This will increase the relevance and salience of biosecurity concerns.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6380892" data-originallang="en">In my opinion, the passing of Bill <a data-HoCid="10866025" href="/bills/43-2/C-205/" title="An Act to amend the Health of Animals Act">C-205</a>, an act to amend the Health of Animals Act, is long overdue. This is an issue that all Canadians should care about. I hope to see all my colleagues join me and the member for <a data-HoCid="252554" href="/politicians/john-barlow/" title="John Barlow">Foothills</a> in supporting this important legislation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6380893" data-originallang="en">The protection of biosecurity on farms has always been an important issue for farmers across the globe, but perhaps it has never been more salient than right now. There are currently no provisions at the federal level to protect our farmers, and the incredible products they produce, from trespassers, who may pass on an array of various diseases to their livestock.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6380894" data-originallang="en">Meanwhile, we are becoming increasingly aware of many diseases plaguing our farmers and animals across the globe. I want to give an example: African swine fever. Of course, the member for <a data-HoCid="252554" href="/politicians/john-barlow/" title="John Barlow">Foothills</a> talked about this. This is a very real concern for Canadian farmers.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6380895" data-originallang="en">I want to tell the story of Chen Yun, a pork farmer in Jiangxi, China. He noticed that one of his pigs had stopped eating. Shortly after, it developed a fever. He was concerned, so he checked on the rest of his pigs. Within a week, all 10,000 of his pigs had died of African swine fever. This virus is highly contagious and affected every province in China, and it led to the slaughter of half of Chinese pigs.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6380896" data-originallang="en">Soon after the outbreak, the fever spread from China to Southeast Asia to central Europe, where it has now reached Belgium. This virus shows the importance of biosecurity and why this legislation is very important.</p>
