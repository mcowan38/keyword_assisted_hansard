<p data-HoCid="8123601" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, despite evidence on the misuse of international aid by Hamas, Canada recently pledged $16.2 million to non-profit organizations in the region, including $10 million to the UN Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, for its Palestinian programs.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8123602" data-originallang="en">How can Canada fund UNRWA when one of its own employees held an Israeli citizen hostage in Gaza? Hamas uses UNRWA buildings to launch rocket attacks. Over 100 Hamas terrorists attended UNRWA schools that teach anti-Semitism and Israel's elimination.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8123603" data-originallang="en">Will Canada review its UNRWA funding and suspend it if the agency is found to be in non-compliance with UN operational standards?</p>
