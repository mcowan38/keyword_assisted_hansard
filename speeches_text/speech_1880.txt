<p data-HoCid="7347185" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, the member made a lot of bizarre and unrelated procedural comments. I will just observe for his benefit that immediately after I spoke, the <a data-HoCid="279313" href="/politicians/anita-vandenbeld/" title="Anita Vandenbeld">parliamentary secretary for international development</a> got up and made what I thought was a very thoughtful intervention with respect to the issue at hand and thanked me for moving the important motion. Maybe this <a data-HoCid="279316" href="/politicians/kevin-lamoureux/" title="Kevin Lamoureux">parliamentary secretary</a> could consult the team within his own caucus who is responsible for foreign affairs issues before he gets up and speaks on these things, but I am much more interested in talking about the issue, rather than chasing the rabbit tracks he has put down for us. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7347186" data-originallang="en">What was the member's reaction on the weekend to comments made on CBC Radio's <em>The House</em> by a Ukrainian member of Parliament who really was sounding the alarm, saying that Canada has fallen behind with respect to supplying vital weapons and that it seems to be strangely reluctant to supply some of the key equipment Ukraine requires? Does he agree with what Ukrainian members of Parliament from various parties are saying, that Canada, which is thought of as an important friend of Ukraine certainly, and the Canadian people want to see their government do more, but it is really falling behind with respect to supporting Ukraine, whether with respect to weapons, energy or other issues?</p>
