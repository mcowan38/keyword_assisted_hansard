<p data-HoCid="7026858" data-originallang="en">I was just suggesting that given our constraints we should set aside the next two meetings to do this type of work. I don't believe any of the parties has been consulted to get to some kind of consensus, so it would save us time for more substantive debate if we held it off until the next meeting and the meeting after that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7026859" data-originallang="en">It's at the will of the committee, of course, if the committee would like to delve into that. I just want to make sure we hold time aside within the remaining minutes—I'm not sure how long we're going to extend for—to hopefully come to a consensus around what has been agreed upon in this initial constituting meeting, and send that back to the House as part of our first interim report. Before we go down a rabbit hole of debating these motions, I just want to make sure we hold fast to that time.</p>
