<p data-HoCid="8019071" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8019072" data-originallang="en">Mr. Marouf was given almost $130,000 to do what the government called “anti-racism training”. We're not entirely sure what was accomplished with that $130,000.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8019073" data-originallang="en"> What we do know is that his entire social media feed is filled with anti-Semitic comments, images and things he has also said with regard to the French language, the French people and very much—I would say even vehemently—against their language and culture. Of course, it should concern us, as Canadians, that there would be an individual who functions like this in the public realm and is then being paid almost $130,000 to run anti-racism training. Almost $130,000 was given to Mr. Marouf in order for him to run anti-racism training, yet his Twitter feed is full of these images, full of these statements that are unquestionably anti-Semitic. It's disgusting, absolutely disgusting, yet this government approved this individual to receive nearly $130,000 to run anti-racism training. I mean, you can't make this stuff up.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8019074" data-originallang="en">This committee then looked at that and came to the conclusion that this was wrong. Then it put forward a motion asking that the money be paid back. It has been more than eight months—eight months—and not a single dollar has been repaid. In fact, the government has spent a fair bit of money trying to get a collection agency to go after Mr. Marouf, but without success.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8019075" data-originallang="en">The question, then, is this: Why hasn't Mr. Marouf paid back the money? Why is Mr. Marouf still allowed to hold this $130,000, and what's he doing with that money? Some of the reasons that this question is all that much more important right now are the war that's taking place in Gaza, the heightened tensions and the heightened anti-Semitic behaviour and comments that are being made in this country. Meanwhile, 130,000 taxpayer dollars still remain in the hands of a verified anti-Semite. That's extremely dangerous and problematic.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8019076" data-originallang="en">We are asking that the committee:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8019077" data-originallang="en"> a) Demand the immediate return of all government grant funding awarded to Laith Marouf; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8019078" data-originallang="en"> b) Call on the Government of Canada to collect the revoked grant funds by any means necessary, including legal action; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8019079" data-originallang="en"> c) Hear testimony from the Minister of Heritage on this matter within one week of this motion being adopted; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8019080" data-originallang="en"> d) Report this to the House. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8019069" data-originallang="en">The reason the <a data-HoCid="300004" href="/politicians/pascale-st-onge/" title="Pascale St-Onge">Minister of Canadian Heritage</a> needs to come and answer is that, ultimately, it is her responsibility to make sure that this money is brought back into the government coffers. It was given to an anti-Semite. It has been demanded that he pay it back, and he needs to make good on that. It is within the mandate of this committee to ensure that's the case.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8019070" data-originallang="en">If the members of this committee vote against this motion, they will be saying that it is okay for Laith Marouf to hold this money and continue to perpetuate his anti-Semitic behaviour. They are saying that it is okay for the government to turn a blind eye. They are saying that it is okay for the <a data-HoCid="300004" href="/politicians/pascale-st-onge/" title="Pascale St-Onge">heritage minister</a> to not have to answer for this, and they are saying that there is no accountability to the House.</p>
