<p data-HoCid="8703208" data-originallang="fr">Yes, we support Israel's right to exist in peace and security, but no country has the right to practise apartheid or be an oppressive state.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703209" data-originallang="fr">Of course, human rights are for everyone. Therein lies the problem with these comments, however. The notion of recognizing the country as a Jewish country is like recognizing Canada as a white country or a Christian country. No, absolutely not. It's for everyone. What we support is equality and human rights for everyone. There can be two, one or three states, or even a confederation. That is what is important.</p>
