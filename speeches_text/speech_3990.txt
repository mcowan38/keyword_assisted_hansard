<p data-HoCid="8387065" data-originallang="en">We've moved to a public meeting.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8387066" data-originallang="en">Before we get on with other business, I'd like to first ask if the clerk can give us an update on the appearance of the <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">minister</a> at the committee. We have passed a number of motions asking for the minister to come.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8387067" data-originallang="en"> One was for two hours on the Gaza and Sudan issue, which was actually passed more than a month ago, back on March 20. As we know, we have an urgent situation with Sudan and Gaza. People are literally dying, and we need to get answers from the <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">minister</a> and officials on this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8387068" data-originallang="en">Have we had any response from the <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">minister</a> on his availability to come before the committee?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8387069" data-originallang="en">There were other motions as well. There was the Hong Kong study. We asked for officials to come, along with ministers. Of course, there are the supplementary estimates. Finally, there's the issue of smuggling and human trafficking.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8387070" data-originallang="en">Have we had any response from the <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">minister</a> on his availability to appear before the committee?</p>
