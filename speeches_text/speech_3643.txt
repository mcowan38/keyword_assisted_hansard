<p data-HoCid="8277103" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, my concern with the motion is the complete lack of accountability that it asks Canadian Parliament to deliver to Hamas.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8277104" data-originallang="en">What I did not hear my colleague talk about was the fact that Hamas is a listed terrorist organization in Canada. He did not reaffirm that. He did not condemn the acts, the brutal rape and murder of over 1,000 Israelis on October 7, 2023. He did not call for the unilateral release of hostages and the unilateral surrender of Hamas right now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8277105" data-originallang="en"> Instead, he is making the argument to Parliament that we should reward the behaviour of Hamas by supporting the motion. Why is he?</p>
