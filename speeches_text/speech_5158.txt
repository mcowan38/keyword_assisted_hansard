<p data-HoCid="8679407" data-originallang="en">Dr. Antonius, I have a question. The framework of the Oslo accord was agreed to by 70% of Palestinians. The number before last year, last October, was only 30%. By the same token, only 20% of Israelis aged 18 to 34 support the two-state solution. It seems like the support among both Palestinians and Israelis, whether for the Oslo accord or for the two-state solution, is low.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679408" data-originallang="en">Can you elaborate on this and what Canada can do to enhance this further in the cloud of what's going on right now, with everybody's stance over the war taking place on the ground?</p>
