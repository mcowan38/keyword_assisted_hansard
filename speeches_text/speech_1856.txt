<p data-HoCid="7345781" data-originallang="fr">Madam Chair, it is my turn to add my voice to those of my colleagues.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345782" data-originallang="fr">I am somewhat surprised to hear my colleague Mr. Nater tell Ms. Saks that if the other members of the committee decide to support Ms. Thomas's proposed motion, the ongoing filibuster will cease. I find that unseemly and a little embarrassing, to be quite honest.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345783" data-originallang="fr">Today we have the only opportunity to get to the bottom of this and talk about this embarrassing situation. The French-speaking community and the Jewish community stand together in this, having both been hurt by unacceptable comments.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345784" data-originallang="fr">I, too, appeal to Ms. Thomas and my Conservative colleagues. We must not be blackmailed, you must stop blocking the work of the committee by forcing us to vote for the motion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345785" data-originallang="fr"> We need to get to the bottom of this and have time to ask our questions of the department officials who are here today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345786" data-originallang="fr">So I appeal to the common sense and reason of my colleagues, Madam Chair.</p>
