<p data-HoCid="8435060" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435061" data-originallang="fr">Since I have just a minute and a half, you will forgive me for going quickly.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435062" data-originallang="fr">There is something I would like to know. We know there is a war being fought right now on the Gaza Strip. I will not attempt to summarize the news or offer a critique, but we know that international opinion is divided. Today we are talking about anti-Semitism in Canada and the fear expressed by the Jewish community in Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435063" data-originallang="fr">Ms. Lyons, in your opinion, are events in Israel and Gaza having an impact on the events we are witnessing in Canada?</p>
