<p data-HoCid="8767640" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, we are well aware of how much hate exists in our communities and the anti-Semitism that exists across Canada right now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8767641" data-originallang="fr">The Bloc Québécois's suggestion is quite welcome. It is a good suggestion, and we would like to study it thoroughly. I do want to emphasize, as I have already mentioned several times, that we have already introduced legislation that would help combat hate in Canada, namely Bill <a data-HoCid="12913297" href="/bills/44-1/C-63/" title="An Act to enact the Online Harms Act, to amend the Criminal Code, the Canadian Human Rights Act and An Act respecting the mandatory reporting of Internet child pornography by persons who provide an Internet service and to make consequential and related amendments to other Acts">C-63</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8767642" data-originallang="fr">If the Bloc Québécois would support us on that, it will help all Canadians.</p>
