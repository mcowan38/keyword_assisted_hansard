<p data-HoCid="8372884" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372885" data-originallang="fr">I too want to thank Ms. Gazan for moving the motion. I also want to thank Ms. Vien. I understand what she is saying. I do not want to make a speech, and I am not going to take a lot of time. I would just like to say a few words, obviously, to thank Ms. Vecchio.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372886" data-originallang="fr">As well, I want to offer my congratulations to Ms. Kramp‑Neuman for her appointment as chair of the committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372887" data-originallang="fr">Madam Chair, we have some things in common.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372888" data-originallang="en">Your father was an MP and my father was an MP. Daryl, your late father, passed away in February—my sympathies to you and your family. I know it was just recently. My father passed away too. I know you've lived in politics, and you understand the nature of working together and collaborating, so I'm looking forward to your being the chair here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372889" data-originallang="en">Obviously, as indicated in the past here from other members, there are some concerns about how we elect chairs, and that's something we maybe could address later on. I've been on this committee now since 2015. <a data-HoCid="278446" href="/politicians/marilyn-gladu/" title="Marilyn Gladu">Marilyn Gladu</a> was the first chair, and then obviously Karen came on. As indicated earlier, it's really something that we should be proud of.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372890" data-originallang="fr">We have done a lot of work here. We have had something like 50 meetings. I think it is important to take time to thank Ms. Vecchio for the way she supported all members of the committee, including me. That is why I wanted to speak today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372891" data-originallang="fr">Ms. Vecchio did exceptional work that was based on her understanding of the issues and her desire to make changes to improve the lives of women across Canada. That was really important to her. She worked hard and she will be much missed on the committee. If my calculations are correct, she actually chaired this committee for seven years.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372892" data-originallang="fr">Ms. Vecchio showed leadership and encouraged collaboration here on the committee. We really want to keep going on that path, Madam Chair. There is no doubt about that. There is no toxic work atmosphere here on the Standing Committee on the Status of Women.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372893" data-originallang="en">In the past when Karen would do some sessions here on the Hill, she would always mention how proud she was of every member of this committee. She would say that for all of the women in the status of women committee, and Marc. She would always just add that little caveat, so I'll miss her greatly. I think she's the only person who called me Marky-Marky.</p>
