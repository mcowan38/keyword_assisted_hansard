<p data-HoCid="8003929" data-originallang="en"> Mrs. Thomas, go ahead.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8003930" data-originallang="en">I think the confusion, if you don't mind me saying, is that we had booked in Catherine Tait before all the issues we have seen in the last two weeks out of the CBC newsreel. The subamendment we're dealing with concerns the reporting out of Gaza since the conflict started between Hamas and Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8003931" data-originallang="en">Yes, we're dealing with a subamendment, but this is where we've crossed the line. We had Tait coming regardless, and now we've asked her to come for two hours. Things have developed, as you know, Mr. Julian. Things have developed over the last two weeks that were, “Really? Is this what's happening?” </p>
<p data-HoCid="8003932" data-originallang="en">That's why your amendment and my subamendment include the CBC. It was because of the issues that happened with the reporting of the public broadcaster.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8003933" data-originallang="en">Mrs. Thomas, if you don't mind, continue on the subamendment.</p>
