<p data-HoCid="8396439" data-originallang="fr"> Given the escalating humanitarian crisis in Gaza, we're reinstating funding for UNRWA as part of our broader commitment to provide urgent assistance to Palestinian civilians facing food shortages and severe restrictions on access to health care.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8396440" data-originallang="en"> UNRWA, I agree with you, represents a lifeline for two million Gazans. When it comes to the infrastructure and their networks for being able to distribute the aid very quickly, they're second to none.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8396441" data-originallang="en"> What more can we do? We of course need to continue to support UNRWA in their efforts to provide more support to the Palestinians in Gaza, but also to work with other organizations, such as the World Food Programme, the World Health Organization, UNICEF and many others, including Canadian organizations that are on the ground in Gaza providing that life-saving assistance.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8396442" data-originallang="en">Access is also an issue. We need to continue to advocate for access and continue to innovate and use other methods when people are in severe need and the regular methods are not working. That's why we pursued airdrops, together with the Jordanians, the Germans, the Dutch and others, through the World Food Programme, for example.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8396443" data-originallang="en">We also need a ceasefire. We need the conflict to end, so that it will be much easier for humanitarian workers to work in a less dangerous environment.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8396444" data-originallang="en"> We need a ceasefire. We need the conflict to end. Ultimately, our government's position is that we need a two-state solution, so we have two states for two peoples living side by side in peace and security.</p>
