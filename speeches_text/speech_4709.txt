<p data-HoCid="8547186" data-originallang="en"> Thank you so much, Chair. Thank you for highlighting the universe of what this motion is, because I don't think it has anything to do with the topic at hand.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8547187" data-originallang="en"> I think this is exactly what I was trying to say. The objective of the motion—as I was trying to put the context together—is to vilify the clean-tech industry. I don't think that's fair to Canada. I don't think it's fair to Canadians. When we go down the path of contribution agreements, etc....</p>
<p data-HoCid="8547188" data-originallang="en"> I'm so sorry, Mr. Perkins. I really can hear you across the chamber. It throws me off my thoughts. If you can speak a bit more quietly or in your mind, that would be really helpful. Thank you. I will try to do the same out of respect for you, as I know you care about the issues we're talking about here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8547189" data-originallang="en"> As I was saying, Chair, it's about going down a rabbit hole that is expanding and vilifying the clean-tech industry here in Canada. I can cite so many instances of contribution agreements that have been signed by previous governments. I think I remember Tony Clement signing one of them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8547190" data-originallang="en"> When so much happens, so much is done. It's for the good and the purpose of making sure that the clean-tech industry, which is a thriving and growing one here in Canada, is able to strive....</p>
<p data-HoCid="8547191" data-originallang="en"> Again, I know the Conservatives love to clip me and put out whatever it is. I want to reiterate that this is not about holding government, government organizations or arm's-length organizations to account. It is about going down a rabbit hole and killing an entire sector. I don't think this motion fits within the spirit of what Canadian industry is about today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8547192" data-originallang="en"> I spoke at length earlier about small businesses that have suffered because of this vilification of small business. What happens if...? What may happen if...? What if this? What if that?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8547193" data-originallang="en"> Well, what if clean tech is able to strive in Canada? What if clean tech becomes the industry that Canada relies on in the future, within the G7, to deal with and fight climate change, while also growing our economy? What if? Why are we trying to kill this industry?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8547194" data-originallang="en"> When I say “we”, I really mean the Conservative Party, Chair. I think this motion is a way to go down a rabbit hole and try to nuke what the clean-tech industry has to offer here in Canada. I think it is a way to create a negative rapport with small businesses and research and development, and to ensure that Canada is pursuing and supporting what is going to be the future of all of our country from coast to coast to coast.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8547195" data-originallang="en">When we order the production of documents and we say, “Find us this document” and “Find us that document,” parliamentarians absolutely have the privilege to request all of those, as does this committee, but to what end and why? Why are Parliament and parliamentarians abusing their power?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8547196" data-originallang="en"> Why are we breaching our Constitution to force the RCMP to do what is its prerogative? Why are we trying to dictate to the Auditor General what she should or should not study, which is her prerogative? Why are we trying to kill the clean-tech sector?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8547197" data-originallang="en"> That is exactly what I think that this motion is trying to represent here—not to me, Chair. I'm not an expert in the clean-tech sector by any means, but that is the message we are sending to small businesses. We're saying, “Look, guys. We don't want your business here. If you try to come and do your business here, we are going to make sure that you come before us. We're going to haul you through the mud and make sure that you are not successful.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8547198" data-originallang="en"> What kind of message are we sending to that industry? What kind of message are we sending to those young people especially, those entrepreneurs who are trying to create an innovative field not only to try to enhance the economy here in Canada but also to try to combat one of the biggest challenges of our time: climate change.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8547199" data-originallang="en"> I think that we need to do better. I think that we need to take the partisan politics out of what the Conservatives are trying to do here and focus on the issue at hand. This motion is not that at all. This motion is a blatant political play in trying to kill an entire industry. This motion is a blatant play in trying to expand and go down all of these rabbit holes to try to find something, anything, that will vilify the clean-tech sector. I think that, as the public accounts committee, we cannot and should not be responsible for its death. I think that the responsibility of this committee is to ensure that we are effectively using taxpayer dollars for the betterment of our country. What this motion represents is the exact opposite of that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8547200" data-originallang="en"> I'll stop there for a second, Mr. Chair. I would like to get back on the bottom of the list.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8547201" data-originallang="en">Thanks, Mr. Chair.</p>
