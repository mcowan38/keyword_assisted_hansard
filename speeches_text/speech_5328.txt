<p data-HoCid="8702962" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8702963" data-originallang="fr">I want to thank the witnesses for being here and sharing their insights on this important issue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8702964" data-originallang="fr">In her testimony, Ms. Kowalski said something that I have always strongly believed, which is that the people of Israel and Palestine cannot continue to live in a state of permanent war. It's not possible. She probably said it much more eloquently than I could have.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8702965" data-originallang="fr">Last week, a former Canadian ambassador to Israel, Jon Allen, argued that the greatest threat to Israel comes from within, and that Israel will never be safe as long as it continues to occupy the Palestinian people's territories in the West Bank and Gaza. Colonization has continued for years, particularly in the West Bank, in violation of international law. There were 1,900 Jewish settlers in the West Bank in 1977; 331,000 Jewish settlers in 1997; and 741,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank in 2022.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8702966" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Fogel, you underscored the consequences of doing something. Have you looked at the consequences of doing nothing? Nothing has changed since 1977, and that led to the October 7 massacre and the butchering currently under way in Gaza and Lebanon.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8702967" data-originallang="fr">What do you think the consequences of doing nothing are?</p>
