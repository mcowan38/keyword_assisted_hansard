<p data-HoCid="8553952" data-originallang="fr">Madam Speaker, it is always a pleasure to rise to speak in the House.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8553953" data-originallang="en">On behalf of the wonderful people of Calgary Midnapore, whom I continue to be so proud to represent, I am here today speaking to Bill <a data-HoCid="12960457" href="/bills/44-1/C-66/" title="An Act to amend the National Defence Act and other Acts">C-66</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8553954" data-originallang="en">I will start by saying that as a Conservative and as a woman here in the House of Commons, I believe and Conservatives believe we need to continue to address sexual misconduct, discrimination, racism and other forms of harassment in the Canadian Armed Forces, because all military members deserve a safe and respectful workplace. I believe this as the shadow minister for the Treasury Board as well. I will also say, with a lot of pride, that Conservatives are proud of and support all of our men and women in uniform who serve Canada. Let us give a round of applause in the House of Commons right now for all the men and women who serve Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8553955" data-originallang="en">The principle of this bill is to be respected and appreciated. However, we need to really consider two major factors when we consider Bill <a data-HoCid="12960457" href="/bills/44-1/C-66/" title="An Act to amend the National Defence Act and other Acts">C-66</a>. Number one is the results we have seen from the Liberal government so far. Is its money where its mouth is? Second is what is really important in our military and what is really going on with our armed forces at this time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8553956" data-originallang="en">The Liberal government has had several reports it could have acted on, but instead, here we are in the last year of a parliamentary session for the current government and only now is it taking action. These reports include the 2015 Deschamps report; the 2018 Auditor General report on inappropriate sexual behaviour in the Canadian Armed Forces; the 2021 Justice Fish report; the 2021 DND-CAF ombudsman report on sexual misconduct; and the 2021 “Eliminating Sexual Misconduct Within the Canadian Armed Forces” report from the status of women committee, which my colleague the member for <a data-HoCid="278446" href="/politicians/marilyn-gladu/" title="Marilyn Gladu">Sarnia—Lambton</a> alluded to in her question to the previous Liberal speaker. There also would have been a report by the Standing Committee on National Defence, but the government instead chose to filibuster and keep the committee in the same meeting for three months and then prorogue Parliament for the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>'s impromptu election. Instead of taking action, the Liberals asked for another report by another former justice and got the 2022 Arbour report.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8553957" data-originallang="en"> Meanwhile, according to Statistics Canada, since 2015, total sexual assaults at all three levels were up 74.83% and increased 71% last year alone.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8553958" data-originallang="en"> My point is that the current government has had the opportunity through several reports to take action and it has deferred taking action. Most insulting, which my colleague referred to, is how the government handled the sexual misconduct cases in 2021. For over six months, the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> and the then defence minister, now <a data-HoCid="300020" href="/politicians/harjit-s-sajjan/" title="Harjit S. Sajjan">Minister of Emergency Preparedness</a>, continually covered up information on sexual misconduct in the Canadian Armed Forces. We are not surprised on this side of the House to see that these concerns, pleas and issues of great importance would only be spoken to, be given platitudes, with no real action taken. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8553959" data-originallang="en">The Liberals then went to great lengths to block investigations and hide the truth from Canadians. Again, this is not only with regard to harm within the Canadian Armed Forces. As a result of soft-on-crime bills, like Bill <a data-HoCid="9745407" href="/bills/42-1/C-75/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code, the Youth Criminal Justice Act and other Acts and to make consequential amendments to other Acts">C-75</a> and Bill <a data-HoCid="11482450" href="/bills/44-1/C-5/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act">C-5</a>, Statistics Canada data since 2015 states that total sexual violations against children are up 118.85%, forcible confinement and kidnapping is up 10.63%, indecent harassing communications are up 86.41%, incidents of non-consensual distribution of intimate images are up 801.17% and trafficking in persons is up 83.68%. This is what we are seeing as a result of the inaction of the current government.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8553960" data-originallang="en">The Liberals put forward bills like Bill <a data-HoCid="12960457" href="/bills/44-1/C-66/" title="An Act to amend the National Defence Act and other Acts">C-66</a>, but they have done nothing. All of their previous platitudes and grandstanding were fake efforts to make real change, not only within Canadian society but within the Canadian Armed Forces. The annual number of reported incidents of sexual misconduct in the Canadian Armed Forces was 256 in 2018-19; it went up to 356 in 2019-20, to 431 in 2020-21, to 444 in 2021-22, and was 443 in 2022-23.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8553961" data-originallang="en">The Liberals talk a lot about things they want to do, reports they are doing and announcements they make, but the results speak for themselves. Nothing has changed. Nothing has improved in the Canadian Armed Forces. Our first point is that we are not seeing the results for the Liberals' efforts, because frankly, the Liberals are not doing anything.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8553962" data-originallang="en">The second is that we need to admit to the serious status of our Canadian Armed Forces, and after nine years of the Liberal government, our military is in a state of disrepair. The government has failed our Canadian Armed Forces and the men and women who serve. Our troops are hurting at home and abroad. They have been sent overseas and forced to pay for their own meals and buy their own equipment. Military families are turning to charity because they cannot afford the basic necessities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8553963" data-originallang="en">In 2017, the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> promised to invest more in our forces, but has instead let $10 billion lapse and is now cutting the defence budget by another billion dollars. This cut affects operational spending. This means the situation facing our troops is not getting better. It is getting worse after nine years of Liberal neglect. The Liberals have overspent in every department except our military. They have shown that they do not care about our troops or the Canadian Forces.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8553964" data-originallang="en">This is being noticed internationally. It is being noticed at NATO. It is being noticed by what is historically our greatest neighbour and ally to the south, the United States of America. It is the reason Canada was excluded from AUKUS, the Australia-U.K.-U.S. arrangement, as well as the quadrilateral security dialogue between Australia, India, Japan and the U.S. There are even discussions to exclude Canada from the G7, if members can believe it, as a result of our lack of commitment. We do not put our money where our mouth is.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8553965" data-originallang="en">Then again, this is not a surprise coming from a <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> who told our heroes they are asking for more than we can give. We are not taken seriously abroad as a result of the constant lack of judgment, whether the Prime Minister is praising the Cuban regime or siding with Hamas over Israel and refusing to support the U.S. in moving its embassy to Israel. It is just a constant lack of making the decision to stand with our allies.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8553966" data-originallang="en">As I said on funding, the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> and the <a data-HoCid="300003" href="/politicians/bill-blair/" title="Bill Blair">defence minister</a> are cutting $1 billion per year over the next three years and allowed $10 billion to lapse in the defence budget over the last several years. In fact, according to the most recent public accounts, $1.2 billion lapsed in defence spending in 2021 alone.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8553967" data-originallang="en">In conclusion, the Liberals can say that they care, that they are doing these nice things. They have had the opportunity to do much. They have constantly kicked the ball down the field and not done anything. The results speak for themselves. The numbers show that crime and acts of violence have not improved in society with their legislation, nor within the Canadian Armed Forces. Most humiliating is the standing we have lost with our allies around the world, as kicking us out of the G7 is being considered. The numbers and the spending show it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8553968" data-originallang="en">A Conservative government would commit the spending, stand with our allies and show our men and women in uniform that it supports them. I look forward to doing that along with the member for <a data-HoCid="278241" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">Carleton</a>.</p>
