<p data-HoCid="6319932" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I would like to begin today by acknowledging we are on the unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinabe Nation, and it continues to be home to many first nations, Métis and Inuit people.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6319933" data-originallang="en">We hear about land acknowledgements a fair bit these days when we go to different events and the like. It is very important that we treat this not as a checkmark, as we continue to talk about issues and about a national day of truth and reconciliation, but as an opportunity to learn the history of the lands.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6319934" data-originallang="en"> Last night, as I was preparing for today, I took some time to learn more about the history of this region. This is an important part of what the bill can be, going forward. We are talking about a day, but it is more than just a day. It is about ensuring that Canadians, in working with indigenous communities and peoples across the country, learn the true history, about which the member for <a data-HoCid="253019" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> so eloquently spoke. I really do appreciate having heard from the member for Winnipeg Centre. She had much to contribute to this conversation. Then we can build our path forward as a country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6319935" data-originallang="en">This bill would create a national day of truth and reconciliation on September 30 each year. It would be a federal statutory holiday. Creating this day responds to call to action 80 of the Truth and Reconciliation calls to action. We have a commitment to respond to all the calls to action that fall within the federal space, and this is one step forward.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6319936" data-originallang="en">It has its roots, though, in the private member's bill that was brought forward by a former member of this place, Georgina Jolibois. I really want to thank her for all the work she did to bring this forward. The work that we did on her bill in committee in the last Parliament set the base for where we are now. I had the honour to be the chair of the committee that studied her bill. It was a great starting place for a lot of learning.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6319937" data-originallang="en">I would like to point out, because I forgot to mention it in advance, that I will be sharing my time with the member for <a data-HoCid="252672" href="/politicians/anthony-housefather/" title="Anthony Housefather">Mount Royal</a>, who will also have much to say on the bill.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6319938" data-originallang="en">I hope we can build on all the work we did in committee. We can take that as a starting place when this bill goes to committee and move quickly together on it. From everything I have heard in the debate, we are in a good place to get it there and will be able to move quickly to ensure we can celebrate and commemorate this day on September 30 of 2021.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6319939" data-originallang="en">I would also like to thank all the witnesses who came to committee and shared their knowledge. As we heard from the member for <a data-HoCid="252596" href="/politicians/martin-shields/" title="Martin Shields">Bow River</a>, who also served with me on that committee in the last Parliament, it was a place for tremendous learning for the members. It is worth thanking the people who took the time to inform us in that way.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6319940" data-originallang="en">As one step forward on the path to reconciliation, the bill is important as it creates a pause, a chance for us to educate, remember, commemorate and to think about where we want to go as we move forward.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6319941" data-originallang="en">When I was in high school, residential schools were still open. In fact, through most of my time at law school, residential schools were still open. However, I never learned about them. We never talked about them. We learned so little about indigenous history and indigenous leaders. This was a tremendous loss. We need to do better. We need to ensure that we take this opportunity so this essential learning is there and is recognized. We need to take that time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6319942" data-originallang="en">I listened to the member for <a data-HoCid="252893" href="/politicians/todd-doherty/" title="Todd Doherty">Cariboo—Prince George</a> speak about growing up. He lived just down the street from the residential school, which is at the heart of Orange Shirt Day. He did not know about the school. He did not know what was happening. He talked about his process of learning more about it and about this day being a difficult one. It is going to require us to rethink parts of our history, a history about which we had not be taught. It is important we hear from people like the member for <a data-HoCid="253019" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> and about the hard, honest truths.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6319943" data-originallang="en">I mentioned some of the previous speakers in this debate. I want to highlight the fact that this has been a special debate for this place. So often it is partisan in here. We do not truly speak with one another and share. Then there are those moments, those bills where we have a debate and we get to hear and share stories, learn from one another and come together. This debate has been one of those times. I want to thank everyone who has participated. I look forward to working with all of them as we go forward to ensure we move the bill through this place quickly and on to the other place.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6319944" data-originallang="en">I mentioned the members for <a data-HoCid="252893" href="/politicians/todd-doherty/" title="Todd Doherty">Cariboo—Prince George</a> and <a data-HoCid="252596" href="/politicians/martin-shields/" title="Martin Shields">Bow River</a>. The members for <a data-HoCid="252667" href="/politicians/jenica-atwin/" title="Jenica Atwin">Fredericton</a> and <a data-HoCid="253014" href="/politicians/rachel-blaney/" title="Rachel Blaney">North Island—Powell River</a> also told very personal stories about their children, their histories. They talked about the importance of recognition and respectful learning as a path forward for their children, that dignity. I would like to thank them for sharing that. It was important to have that part of our history.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6319945" data-originallang="en">When we talk about this day, it is important to think about the words in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's final report:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="6319946" data-originallang="en"> All Canadian children and youth deserve to know Canada’s honest history, including what happened in the residential schools, and to appreciate the rich history and knowledge of Indigenous nations who continue to make such a strong contribution to Canada, including our very name and collective identity as a country. For Canadians from all walks of life, reconciliation offers a new way of living together. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="6319947" data-originallang="en">We have spent a lot of time in this place talking about residential school history and the need to tell the truth about our history. However, that statement also includes the path of hope, the fact that it is about reconciliation and offering a new way of living together. It highlights the need to appreciate the rich history and knowledge of indigenous nations. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6319948" data-originallang="en">During the study of the bill put forward by Georgina Jolibois in the last Parliament, there was much discussion about how this day should be commemorated. On that point, I find that the words of the president of ITK, Natan Obed, go to the heart of some of this conversation. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="6319949" data-originallang="en"> It would be, in our position, much better for the day to be positive and be forward-looking than to be a remembrance day of sorts for certain grievances in the past—although history will be, of course, a part of the overarching conversation. I know there are direct links between the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls to action and this particular piece of legislation. I don't want to lose those entirely, but I do want Canadians and first nations, Inuit and Métis to have the ability to talk about the positive and the great strength that we bring to Canadian society, and the great leaders we have within our communities, and the visions we have for the future as Canadians but also as indigenous peoples exercising our right to self-determination. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="6319950" data-originallang="en">It highlights the need that as we talk about our history, we also remember to learn more about strong indigenous leaders and their contributions to the country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6319951" data-originallang="en">I would like briefly talk about why September 30 is important, an issue that has come up in the past.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6319952" data-originallang="en"> September 30 is an important date because September was seen, as was told by Phyllis Webstad, as the crying month. That date is at a time when kids are back in school, so it is an opportunity for teachers to speak with their students about these issues. At the committee, some people suggested that perhaps we should look at appropriating another day, for example Remembrance Day. That is not the right way to go. The debate I have heard so far in this place has centred very much on the idea that we should move forward with the date that has been chosen.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6319953" data-originallang="en">I look forward to working with members from all across this place to ensure we can move quickly to make this day a reality.</p>
