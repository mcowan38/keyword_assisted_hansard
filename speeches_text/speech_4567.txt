<p data-HoCid="8493353" data-originallang="fr">Politically, yes, for sure. However, even though it's legitimate and justifiable, I don't think that it's a good idea right now to include the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, on the list of terrorist entities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8493354" data-originallang="fr">Will this stop the IRGC from doing what it's doing? I don't know. I don't have the legal expertise to comment on this. However, we can always initiate all possible procedures and take all possible steps, without necessarily making a political decision that will have an ideological, geostrategic and geopolitical impact in the Middle East. This impact could tarnish Canada's image and continue to create this void. At this time, no one can act as an intermediary in all this anarchy affecting the Middle East.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8493355" data-originallang="fr">Canada has a certain reputation over there. This country is known for its neutrality and for not being too Islamophobic, in comparison with other countries such as France or the United States. If Canada decides to designate the IRGC as a terrorist organization now, under the current circumstances, it will first and foremost simply destroy this image.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8493356" data-originallang="fr">Second, in both Shiite and Sunni circles throughout the Muslim world, Canada will unfortunately be associated with the mass slaughter now taking place in Gaza. My point is that the drawbacks of this decision far outweigh the benefits. Moreover, as I said, the IRGC members aren't choirboys. They're killers. That much is certain. However, this is the wrong time to make this type of decision.</p>
