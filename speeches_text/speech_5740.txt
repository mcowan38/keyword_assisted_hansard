<p data-HoCid="8794131" data-originallang="en">I want to go back to the question of the chilling effect. We're talking about what the ICJ has referred to as a plausible genocide happening in Gaza and, obviously, we know as well about the bombing of Lebanon that has occurred over the last number of weeks. We also know that Canada is complicit in terms of both the arms trade and financial transfers, and of course, through the political cover that Canada has given to Netanyahu's regime.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8794132" data-originallang="en">I'm wondering, when we're talking about hundreds of thousands of Canadians speaking out, coming out on the streets and sharing on social media, how deeply troubling it is that there's a chilling effect in a country like Canada, where we claim to uphold human rights in a vivid democracy and in democratic debate, including on foreign policy. How problematic is this chilling effect?</p>
