<p data-HoCid="7345621" data-originallang="en">That's a very good question. Thank you very much for this important question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345622" data-originallang="en">My expectation was that the measures in place at that time would have included robust vetting and due diligence measures and steps to ensure that this individual and organization would not go through the cracks.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345623" data-originallang="en">Now we're introducing a new vetting process to ensure, for example, that there is enhanced vetting training for program officers and ensure that multiple officials review each and every application so that mistakes can be caught, and to ensure that there is enhanced anti-racism and anti-Semitism training for all program officers.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345624" data-originallang="en">To develop this training, we're turning to the experts, people like the Honourable Irwin Cotler, the special envoy to combat anti-Semitism, Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center, and the Jewish Public Servants' Network to develop this program.</p>
