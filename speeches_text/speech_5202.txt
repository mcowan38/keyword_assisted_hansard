That said, she represents the United Nations and certainly has information about human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories. She is definitely able to provide us with relevant information. Further to the previous discussions we've had among ourselves, which I won't dwell on, I would like us to at least have the opportunity to meet with her informally.</p>
