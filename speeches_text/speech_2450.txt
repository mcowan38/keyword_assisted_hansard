<p class="procedural" data-HoCid="0">moved for leave to introduce Bill <a data-HoCid="12484947" href="/bills/44-1/C-338/" title="National Indigenous Teachers Day Act">C-338, National Indigenous Teachers Day Act</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, today, during Indigenous History Month, it is my great privilege to table this very important piece of legislation, the national indigenous teachers day act, which would designate February 22 of each year as national indigenous teachers day.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">I want to thank the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> for seconding this bill, but perhaps more importantly, I want to thank and acknowledge Theodore Anton, a grade 11 student from Old Scona Academic high school in Edmonton Strathcona, for the idea to recognize and celebrate the vital contributions and perspectives in education that indigenous educators bring to our schools. Theodore is the winner of my Create Your Canada contest, and he is in Ottawa with his parents to help me present this bill.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">I thank Theodore and all the amazing young people who submitted ideas to make Canada a better place for everyone. I urge my fellow parliamentarians to support this bill, as it would mark an important step on the path toward reconciliation.</p>
