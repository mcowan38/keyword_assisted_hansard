<p data-HoCid="7871959" data-originallang="en">Yes. New paragraph (c.2), as it stands now would, at least from an implementation perspective, sow confusion, because I don't know what it's asking for. If it's asking for the name of the corporation that the individual of significant control is investing in, that's how you get to it in the registry. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7871960" data-originallang="en">If I'm Mark Schaan Incorporated and my beneficial owner is Mark Schaan, the name of the company is Mark Schaan Incorporated, which you already clicked on to get to the individual of significant control. The individual of significant control is the natural person at the end of it, who is Mark Schaan. That's what we're asking for. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7871961" data-originallang="en">We're not asking for the name of the company. What we're asking for are humans, not corporations, because corporations by their very nature.... Then, we're in a rabbit hole of trying to figure it out.</p>
