<p data-HoCid="8330016" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8330017" data-originallang="en">I'd be remiss not to note that it took our having these amendments to have a real discussion about what had transpired prior to the March break. It's with quite deep disappointment that the Conservative caucus has this tendency to bring the same motion to every committee, across all of our standing committees, in a very theatrical way. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8330018" data-originallang="en">I had a conversation directly with <a data-HoCid="278408" href="/politicians/michael-chong/" title="Michael Chong">Michael Chong</a>. There was a time when he was a reasonable and a practical guy. Some would even call him a progressive conservative. I believed him to be a man of his word. I recall having a conversation directly with him prior to the Standing Order 106 meeting that was called by our Conservative colleagues here, where he understood that this was going to go to the Canada-China committee. If the study were to be duplicated that way, I told him quite frankly that there was no willingness on the part of our party to see the same study happen, to be rolled out across all of our standing committees. Yet, in whatever way he thought was appropriate, he brought this as a Standing Order 106 motion to this committee, stood in and basically presented this for the news cycle. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8330019" data-originallang="en">I want people to know, people from his riding, practical conservatives that are out there, that there are lots of conversations had at committees, and prior to committee meetings, about organizing our time, about the value for taxpayer dollars and the way in which we do our work. When it comes to Standing Order 106 meetings, it needs to be made very clear that those are for emergency situations. They have to be very pertinent to the mandate—at least in my estimation of the committee. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8330020" data-originallang="en">To see and to know that he knew this was going to the Canada-China committee, and to still bring it here for the theatre of that one-week news cycle, I think is despicable. It's disgraceful. We always support access to information—at least I do, as a New Democrat—yet on principle, I couldn't support what they were trying to do because I knew it was duplicitous. I knew it was deceitful. I certainly wasn't going to support it, which is why I supported the adjournment. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8330021" data-originallang="en">I do support the clarity provided by this amendment because it's pertinent and relevant to the work we do at this committee. It's within our mandate. I think it is within a timeline that is acceptable for all the other work we have. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8330022" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, you'll know that, for quite some time, this committee seems to be a "tail chasing the dog", and not the other way around. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8330023" data-originallang="en">I'd like to see some focus in this committee. I'd like to see open and honest dealings with the opposition side, with the government, and when you say you're going to do something, you stick to it. You don't come out pulling the rabbit out of the hat with some kinds of surprises so that you can score a short-cycle news cycle, a fundraising letter or whatever the heck <a data-HoCid="278408" href="/politicians/michael-chong/" title="Michael Chong">Michael Chong's</a> agenda was when he came and visited this meeting. I certainly wasn't here for it, and I wasn't about to disrupt the work of this committee to make a precedent out of something that he already knew was already going to the Canada-China committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8330024" data-originallang="en">I would say this to the opposition folks and to all folks on this committee: If you're serious about operating within integrity and about following the courtesies that we have, even though we might not always agree on things, I'm for it, but if you continue with the procedural shenanigans to try to disrupt every single committee across the House of Commons so that you can then point at it and say, “Look, it's broken”, when you're the one who is intent on breaking it, just know this: For all the Conservatives watching this, for the media who wrote stories and who didn't even have the courtesy to call, to reach out and to try to get my rationale for it, shame on you. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8330025" data-originallang="en">I will be supporting this, but if you all are going to continue to bring pinch-hitters into this committee to disrupt it, then I'll meet your belligerence with belligerence. That's all I have to say.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8330026" data-originallang="en">I'm looking forward to having a discussion on the amendments that Mr. Villemure put forward. I'm looking forward to working as a committee to hold government accountable, to make sure our departments are held accountable and to protect our parliamentary privileges. I'm not here for your theatre or your shenanigans, and I'm not here for the circus. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8330027" data-originallang="en">You can tell I'm fired up because I thought I was dealing with <a data-HoCid="278408" href="/politicians/michael-chong/" title="Michael Chong">Michael Chong</a>, whom had, at least I thought, some good faith in his negotiations, and then he tried to come in here and pulled a fast one. Let this be a message to anybody else who wants to try to do the same. When you do that, no matter what, I'm going to shut it down. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8330028" data-originallang="en">That's all I have to say. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8330029" data-originallang="en">Thank you. </p>
