<p data-HoCid="6847050" data-originallang="fr">It's only you. I see.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6847051" data-originallang="fr">I imagine the Conservative Party of Canada is proud of CIMS, its system, and the NDP is surely proud of its system, Populus. I commend both parties.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6847052" data-originallang="fr">What worries me, as Ms. Lattanzio and Mrs. Shanahan have already pointed out, is that this smells of a witch hunt.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6847053" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Barrett is acting like he's being entirely reasonable by saying he would support holding just one two-hour meeting with witnesses, but we've heard that line numerous times over the past 15 months. Every time someone appears, they mention another name, and suddenly the committee has to probe further, even if it's not at all relevant. We have to invite someone else, and so it goes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6847054" data-originallang="fr">Forgive me, then, if I'm a bit hesitant to go along with this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6847055" data-originallang="en">I've been down that rabbit hole before.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6847056" data-originallang="fr">Even if you think I'm wrong, Mr. Chair, I know I stand on solid footing when it comes to the role of this committee versus that of the Board of Internal Economy. I won't repeat what my fellow members have already said, since they did a good job of articulating this committee's responsibilities. They also pointed out that another committee is entrusted with examining the spending and activities—past and current—of members and their constituency offices, and that committee is the Board of Internal Economy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6847057" data-originallang="fr">No expense considered to be invalid is authorized without the board's approval. Occasionally, people can make mistakes, and the consequences can be quite serious. The Board of Internal Economy has been known to make some very weighty decisions to reassure Canadians that the spending of parliamentarians, specifically, members of the House of Commons, complies with the rules.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6847058" data-originallang="fr"> The Parliament of Canada Act is crystal clear about the exclusive authority of the Board of Internal Economy. Subsection 52.6(1) says and I quote:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="6847059" data-originallang="fr"> 52.6 (1) The Board has the exclusive authority to determine whether any previous, current or proposed use by a member of the House of Commons of any funds, goods, services or premises made available to that member for the carrying out of parliamentary functions is or was proper, given the discharge of the parliamentary functions of members of the House of Commons, including whether any such use is or was proper having regard to the intent and purpose of the by-laws made under subsection 52.5(1). </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="6847060" data-originallang="fr">That is the body that should be examining this issue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6847061" data-originallang="fr">Mrs. Shanahan's amendment shows that we are prepared to support Mr. Barrett's motion, which, according to him, was prompted by a media report. That is why he feels we should examine the issue. Actually, Mr. Barrett is signalling that it was four news articles. Thank you for correcting me.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6847062" data-originallang="fr">I believe the four articles—well, three of them, at least—refer to the systems used by the Liberals, the Conservatives and the NDP. Unfortunately, though, Mr. Barrett's motion pertains solely to one party. Mrs. Shanahan made the point that we should broaden the motion to cover not only what the Liberal members are doing, but also what the members of the official opposition are doing. The issues raised in the news reports are actually of great interest to Canadians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6847063" data-originallang="fr">I hope my fellow members will allow these issues to be referred to the Board of Internal Economy, which, as a committee of the House, could look into everything and report its findings to all members.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6847064" data-originallang="fr">I think that's the best way forward. That is why the amendment was moved and why I, personally, will support it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6847065" data-originallang="fr">If we stick to the motion as moved, we will fall into the same trap that we unfortunately fell into before. Mr. Chair, I know you came a long way to be at this meeting in person, and I certainly appreciate the efforts of every committee member to attend this meeting. No one wants to waste time, but we have to tell it like it is. We have to set the record straight, and that's why I feel so strongly about doing things the right way. That means referring the matter to the committee responsible for examining the previous, current and proposed expenditures incurred by members and their offices. The committee with that responsibility is the Board of Internal Economy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6847066" data-originallang="fr">I can well imagine what would happen if we did not support the amendment and the motion was adopted unamended. I can hear it now. I would bet any amount of money that, as soon as the witness mentioned someone's name, members would probably want to invite that person to appear before the committee. It would be a name here, a name there; we would have to keep inviting people and so on. I've seen this show before, and honestly, the reviews weren't good.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6847067" data-originallang="fr">It's time to move on. We should be smart about how we use our time and energy—what we focus our efforts on. I think the committee members should really support the amendment and refer this matter to the proper authority.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6847068" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
