<p data-HoCid="8435439" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much. I'd like to thank the witnesses for being here today and sharing their testimony with us. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8435440" data-originallang="en">I have to take a moment out of the committee time at this point to move a motion that I had brought forward some time ago. It is on a very important issue that I think this committee needs to deal with as urgently as possible.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435441" data-originallang="en"> It is with regard to the sales of arms and goods to Israel. Notice of the motion was first given on April 10. Would the members like me to read the motion, or are they aware of the content of the motion? </p>
