<p data-HoCid="8683552" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8683553" data-originallang="en">I'll begin my questions with you, Dr. Ge. It's clear that your story demonstrates society's limit of freedom of expression, especially when it comes to speaking up on Palestine. Looking at the horrors being inflicted on Palestinians in Gaza during the current onslaught by Israel, you called it “apartheid upon Palestinian people” and “settler colonialism”. Then a colleague publicly criticized you and the school suspended you, citing a breach of professional standards. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8683554" data-originallang="en">This didn't come from your patients. This didn't come from anyone you worked with directly. Your suspension meant that projects you were working on, including ones on behalf of the Public Health Agency of Canada, did not continue. This has had a direct negative impact on Canadians. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8683555" data-originallang="en">However, your suspension didn't penalize only you. It also punished the people who rely on you as a medical resident. Due to the fallout from your suspension, the residency program lost its program director and possible threats to its accreditation, the worst possible outcome.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8683556" data-originallang="en">Can you describe how your suspension has had a negative impact on critical work in health care, particularly public health, for Canadians?</p>
