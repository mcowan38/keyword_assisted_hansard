<p data-HoCid="8642677" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, the violence in the Middle East needs to end. It cannot continue to see civilians killed, innocents wiped out and communities destroyed. We need to make sure there is a ceasefire in Gaza and in Lebanon. We need to see the path once again toward a two-state solution where a peaceful Israel lives alongside a peaceful Palestinian state. That is Canada's position.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8642678" data-originallang="en">That continues to be what we fight for every single day to bring a global consensus together to protect lives, to get humanitarian aid in, to release hostages and to end this conflict once and for all.</p>
