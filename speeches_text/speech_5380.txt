<p data-HoCid="8703225" data-originallang="en">Canadian Palestinian communities, especially in the last year, have experienced so much anti-Palestinian racism. Anti-Palestinian racism starts by denying the existence of the Palestinian people. The failure of Canada and part of the international community to not recognize the Palestinian state is the first step of not recognizing Palestinians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703226" data-originallang="en"> As Canadian Palestinians, we have suffered so many incidents, and we saw so many incidents when just trying to speak for human rights and speak about the genocide that is going on and the killing of Palestinian people. Doctors are fired from their hospitals. University professors have been stopped from work, and then they returned back to work because.... We all saw this, and we're still in this mess that we are in.</p>
