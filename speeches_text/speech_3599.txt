<p data-HoCid="8249749" data-originallang="fr">Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his work.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8249750" data-originallang="fr">To us in the NDP, what was really important in Bill <a data-HoCid="12138647" href="/bills/44-1/C-35/" title="An Act respecting early learning and child care in Canada">Câ€‘35</a> was that it prioritizes a public, not-for-profit, co-operative or community child care model. My colleague from <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> has done a lot of work on this and I congratulate her on that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8249751" data-originallang="fr">How important is it to my colleague that the private sector not be the one effectively prioritized in order to keep the prices reasonable and affordable for the families that really need it? That way we would be contributing to helping people return to work because their children could go to a co-operative or public affordable child care centre.</p>
