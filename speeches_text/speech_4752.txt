<p data-HoCid="8574282" data-originallang="en">I can read it out. I have it here. It states:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8574283" data-originallang="en"> Given that the RCMP have arrested an additional alleged ISIS terrorist, who was preparing to carry out a massacre targeting the Jewish community in New York City, the committee expand its Review of the Foiled Terrorist Plot in Toronto and of the Security Screening Process for Permanent Residence and Citizenship Application by no fewer than eight meetings to further examine how alleged ISIS terrorists are able to enter and reside in Canada; that the Minister of Public Safety and his officials be invited to reappear for no less than two hours; that IRCC officials, CBSA officials, RCMP officials and CSIS officials be invited to reappear before the committee; and that no more than one minister, agency or department testify at a time. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8574284" data-originallang="en"> I'll speak very briefly to this, because, as I was saying, Chair, I really do want to get back to our study at hand. Obviously, I'm looking for more time. We're finding a lot of information here, but there's a lot of information yet to come out. One of the interesting things that the <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">minister</a>, just in the last hour, mentioned was that there will be findings in a few weeks of their study. That would be great to be able to bring up in this study that we're doing here. That's one of the other reasons we want to lengthen this. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8574285" data-originallang="en">Therefore, I hope all of our committee members can agree to this. I'm not going to go on long about this. Hopefully, we can agree that this is an important study. Canadians need this. There are some fears out there right now. We need to make sure there are going to be some corrections coming. I'll leave that on the floor. Hopefully, this passes. </p>
