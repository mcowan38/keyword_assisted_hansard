<p data-HoCid="8173137" data-originallang="en">As <em>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</em>, third edition, states on page 770, “An amendment to a bill that was referred to a committee after second reading is out of order if it is beyond the scope and principle of the bill.” In the opinion of the chair, this amendment introduces a new concept that is beyond the scope of the bill as agreed to by the House at second reading. Therefore, I rule the amendment inadmissible.</p>
