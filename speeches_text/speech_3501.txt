<p data-HoCid="8232785" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8232786" data-originallang="en">Welcome, Ms. Romanado.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8232787" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Maloney, welcome to our committee. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8232788" data-originallang="en"> Senator Smith, welcome. You're new and we've all been hearing evidence and discussing these issues for what may seem a daunting length of time, but these are important issues. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8232789" data-originallang="en">First, there are some takeaways I want to highlight. I certainly will try not to repeat the comments of my colleague Mr. Motz. We also would like to come to a conclusion sooner than later. I believe there is a path forward to doing that by the end of this session sometime in June. When this particular committee began its examination of the invocation of the act and the circumstances surrounding it, while we had heard rumours that there might be a charter challenge, we didn't know what that would look like and we didn't know what the results would be, but we certainly had that at the back of our minds moving forward.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8232790" data-originallang="en">I also want to highlight the issue of witnesses. Back in December 2022, with a tie vote—and in this particular committee a tie vote results in the defeating of a particular motion—a motion was brought by the Conservative team to extend the study to call further witnesses who we had deemed would provide relevant information. The vote was five to five, so by no means did that vote indicate a strong majority preference, in my view, to shut down the possibility of hearing from further witnesses. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8232791" data-originallang="en">We lived by that decision and we then instructed the analysts to prepare a review of the material and to provide us with draft reports. We are now in draft version number three. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8232792" data-originallang="en">During that time frame, we had the Rouleau commission. I want to highlight that although it's statutorily mandated that a commission be launched during the invocation of the act or following the invocation of the Emergencies Act and although it was presided over by a justice—a Superior Court justice—the mandate of Justice Rouleau was not to provide any charter analysis of the legality behind the invocation of the act. That legal mandate did not exist, and I think in his wisdom, Justice Rouleau definitely shied away from making legal pronouncements because he knew that ultimately this was a matter that was going to be studied and argued in the Federal Court. At this point, two institutions, as outlined in our particular motion, have launched a charter challenge—the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and the Canadian Constitution Foundation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8232793" data-originallang="en">Justice Rouleau, as my colleague indicated in his opening remarks and in the report itself, made it abundantly clear that there was no overwhelming evidence that would have led him to conclude that there was legal justification for the Liberal government's invoking of the act given the circumstances present primarily in downtown Ottawa and secondarily with respect to some of the border crossings in Alberta and in Windsor, Ontario. He made it clear that reasonable people who had the ability to review all the evidence he had heard could come to a completely different conclusion than he did. I highlight the word “evidence”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8232794" data-originallang="en"> This segues to the concern that our francophone members have on this committee, that the submissions and evidence heard at the Rouleau commission were not translated into the other official language, which has compromised the constitutional right that all members have in this House and in the Senate to receive information in both official languages. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8232795" data-originallang="en">The motion was drafted in such a way that we don't want every single submission or piece of material officially translated into the other official language. It would take years to do that. I think we received a figure, in terms of the cost analysis, of well over $300 million. At one point, this committee said that sounded like a daunting task, and given the financial crisis we have in this country, the affordability issues, and the thousands of families who are literally one paycheque away from insolvency, we have to be prudent stewards of taxpayer money. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8232796" data-originallang="en">So that, in my opinion, would not be a proper exercise of our authority. We talked about perhaps just getting the index translated, such as an index indicating how the arguments were presented so that we could identify who said what, and maybe an index of the 2,500 potential exhibits. That price tag was $5 million or $6 million, which was another extraordinary expense that could not be justified under any circumstances.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8232797" data-originallang="en">The motion is drafted as such so that we can hear from individuals to perhaps give us the answers we seek without going through the expense. I can't speak for my colleague and chair Monsieur Fortin, but I can speak on behalf of Senator Carignan. He's certainly on the speaking list, and I don't want to take away his submissions, but I think that was a reasonable compromise. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8232798" data-originallang="en">I appreciate your approach, Ms. Romanado. I think we're not too far off in terms of where we both see a pathway to proceed with, but I think it's incumbent on us as parliamentarians and senators to give value to Canadians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8232799" data-originallang="en"> This was an extraordinary time in this country during the pandemic and the response to the pandemic by the convoy and the supporters of the convoy who descended here in Ottawa. But I think it's a reminder to us all that we are a country of law. We are a country of order. We don't interpret the laws to fit what we believe as a government, a narrative that's not supported and grounded by facts and not supported and grounded by the legislation. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8232800" data-originallang="en">The legislation in the Emergencies Act was abundantly clear. It could not be more clear that the definition of a national emergency was the same definition as defined under the CSIS Act. It did not say anywhere “or as other interpretations may be available” or “or as other circumstances may be available”. The law was black and white. It wasn't grey. That's what we expect in this country. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8232801" data-originallang="en">As drafters of legislation, we use our best skills and resources to provide clarity with the law. Sometimes we get it right and sometimes we get it wrong. Courts and appeal courts, and ultimately the Supreme Court of Canada, will weigh in if we do get it wrong. In this particular case, as my colleague Mr. Motz has indicated, we heard from Perrin Beatty, who was a cabinet minister and primarily the architect of the Emergencies Act.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8232802" data-originallang="en"> As we all know, the Emergencies Act was designed to replace the War Measures Act, which has significant flaws in terms of trouncing the civil liberties of Canadians, and there was a mandate to do better. It was a mandate to create the strongest, most powerful law available to a national government in times of true national emergencies. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8232803" data-originallang="en">Through resources that may not be wholly available to this committee, I've certainly been privy to resources from the government itself, indicating that there was even a consideration of the invocation of the Emergencies Act at the outset of the pandemic—frightening and disturbing on so many levels.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8232804" data-originallang="en">Then we had evidence very early on of then minister <a data-HoCid="278544" href="/politicians/david-lametti/" title="David Lametti">Lametti</a>, the most powerful legislator and lawyer in this country, jokingly opining with <a data-HoCid="278567" href="/politicians/marco-mendicino/" title="Marco Mendicino">Minister Mendicino</a> on day two of the convoy, "Let's bring in the tanks." Appalling—it was a joke, but it was an appalling remark.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8232805" data-originallang="en">I have defended, and I will defend with my last breath, as a member of the Law Society of Ontario, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8232806" data-originallang="en">While the Charter of Rights and Freedoms is drafted in such a way that these are not absolute rights, they are enshrined rights, and they are valued rights; the right to freedom of expression, the right to peaceful assembly, the right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8232807" data-originallang="en">All of this ultimately came to a head with this Liberal government, notwithstanding that the Ottawa Police Service, as well as the City of Ottawa municipal government, directed the convoy truckers to park on Wellington Street, directed that there be an off-site location for the supply of materials to run back and forth. All of this was planned. It was organized. There was discussion between legal authorities and the truckers.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8232808" data-originallang="en">One thing that no witness has ever been able to answer—and if I asked it a half a dozen times, I probably asked it two dozen times—is at what point in time and at what event this lawful exercise of the freedom of expression and assembly, as directed by legal authorities, became unlawful. No one could answer that. The only thing I could surmise is that it became inconvenient to the government. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8232809" data-originallang="en">It was certainly inconvenient to citizens in downtown Ottawa, the smell of diesel, the noise, the commotion, but according to Justice Mosley's decision, that's not a national emergency. That's what protests are. Protests can be loud. They can be uncomfortable. They can be a nuisance, but it doesn't rise to the high, legal threshold of an national emergency.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8232810" data-originallang="en">All I ever heard, both from parliamentarians and from Canadians, is that this was required; that lawful, legal measures were simply incapable of dealing appropriately with the removal of this blockade. There's contradictory evidence, and I'm not going to get into that. The evidence is already on the table on that issue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8232811" data-originallang="en"> More importantly, what we heard from the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, <a data-HoCid="278567" href="/politicians/marco-mendicino/" title="Marco Mendicino">Marco Mendicino</a>, <a data-HoCid="278544" href="/politicians/david-lametti/" title="David Lametti">David Lametti</a>,<a data-HoCid="263835" href="/politicians/chrystia-freeland/" title="Chrystia Freeland"> Minister Freeland</a>, <a data-HoCid="300003" href="/politicians/bill-blair/" title="Bill Blair">Minister Blair</a> and probably the entire cabinet bench, was that this was necessary, lawful and had legal justification; it was charter-compliant.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8232812" data-originallang="en">When we asked for evidence of charter compliance, they said, “Oh, you can't have that. That's protected by cabinet confidentiality,” or, “You can't have that, Mr. Brock. That's protected by solicitor-client privilege.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8232813" data-originallang="en">The <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> had no problem waiving privilege and confidentiality with Justice Rouleau, save for the legal opinion that they received from the Department of Justice, which would have laid out under what legal authority the Prime Minister and government could invoke that act. They would not share that, even with Justice Rouleau.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8232814" data-originallang="en">I remember this exchange because I watched it live, and I read the transcript. We heard the chief testimony of <a data-HoCid="278544" href="/politicians/david-lametti/" title="David Lametti">David Lametti</a>, the former justice minister, and the cross examination. As judges often do and are entitled to do, Justice Rouleau questioned the witnesses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8232815" data-originallang="en">Justice Rouleau—I'm not quoting word for word here—essentially said, “You're not going to give us the legal opinion that justified your use of the invocation of the act. Do I simply have to accept your opinion that it provided you with the legal authority?” and David Lametti said, “Yes, take my opinion.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8232816" data-originallang="en">He could be right, but also could be wrong. I think it's important that we have access to that legal opinion, which is why we set it out in the notice of motion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8232817" data-originallang="en">Ultimately, the government telegraphed, literally within minutes, an intention to appeal Justice Mosley's decision. He's a very senior justice of the Federal Court—appointed by a Liberal prime minister, I might add.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8232818" data-originallang="en">Other significant decisions that impact the lives of Canadians are taken under advisement. The government examines all of the circumstances behind the decision and weighs its options before considering whether or not to appeal, but not in this case. It was literally a jackrabbit response. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8232819" data-originallang="en">“He got it wrong,”—we heard that from our <a data-HoCid="299997" href="/politicians/arif-virani/" title="Arif Virani">new justice minister</a>—“He committed judicial errors.” I'm sure that at that point our <a data-HoCid="278544" href="/politicians/david-lametti/" title="David Lametti">justice minister</a> hadn't even read the full decision. It was a very lengthy decision. I would be surprised if he had the time to read the decision in full before he quickly pronounced himself on all of the judicial errors that Justice Mosley made in his decision. This again was parroted by the <a data-HoCid="263835" href="/politicians/chrystia-freeland/" title="Chrystia Freeland">Deputy Prime Minister</a> and many other ministers—“There are justifiable legal errors that we can appeal.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8232820" data-originallang="en">If they hold true to their word—and they will appeal this decision—ultimate, the appellate court, be it the Federal Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court of Canada, is going to hear from Department of Justice lawyers as to what legal advice they gave to justify the invocation of the act.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8232821" data-originallang="en">It's eventually going to come out. If it's going to come out eventually, in this promised appeal, then let us share this with parliamentarians, with committee members and with Canadians, because they have a right to this information, as do we.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8232822" data-originallang="en">I've gone on long enough. I know other members want to talk. I don't want to sit here until 9:30.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8232823" data-originallang="en"> I'm going to cede my time to the chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8232824" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much.</p>
