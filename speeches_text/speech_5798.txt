<p data-HoCid="8767488" data-originallang="fr"> Mr. Speaker, after months of investigating, gathering data, hearing testimony and analyzing the facts, Amnesty International has concluded that genocide is taking place against Palestinians in Gaza.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8767489" data-originallang="fr">After the bombing of civilian populations that has killed more than 52,000 people, injured more than 100,000 and displaced two million people in a zone from which they cannot escape, and with a humanitarian crisis where hunger is being used as a weapon of war, this conclusion will come as no surprise. At least, it should not surprise anyone who has been paying any attention at all and has any compassion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8767490" data-originallang="fr">With that in mind, Canada is violating its own legal obligations under the genocide prevention convention. Despite its promises, the Liberal government continues to authorize arms sales to the Israeli regime.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8767491" data-originallang="fr">In doing so, the Liberals risk being complicit in a genocide that is happening right before our very eyes. That is why the Liberal government must sanction the Netanyahu regime, stop the arms sales and officially recognize the Palestinian state.</p>
