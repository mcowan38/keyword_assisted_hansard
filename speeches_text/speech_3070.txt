<p data-HoCid="8053665" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, born and raised in Winnipeg, Vivian Silver left her mark on her hometown, our country and people around the world. She dedicated her life to the pursuit of peace, working tirelessly to build bridges between Israelis and Palestinians. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8053666" data-originallang="en">She helped found numerous organizations for the betterment of all peoples, one of which was the Arab-Jewish Center for Empowerment, Equality and Cooperation. In recognition of all of her work, she was the co-recipient of the Victor J. Goldberg Prize for Peace in the Middle East.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8053667" data-originallang="en">She was a very busy woman doing good and she was also a wonderful mother and grandmother, said her two sons, Yonatan and Chen.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8053668" data-originallang="en">Since her disappearance from her home on Kibbutz Be’eri, I had the chance to speak almost daily with Vivian's nephew, a dear childhood friend of mine in Winnipeg, and I heard first-hand the pain her family was experiencing during the madness of the past few weeks.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8053669" data-originallang="en">A close friend of Vivian said this of her recently: “I have to hope that the life she lived and what she worked for will sow the seeds of peace and that somehow it will come around as part of her legacy and as part of who she was, that it is achievable.” </p>
<p data-HoCid="8053670" data-originallang="en">I hope that everyone in the House can join me in a celebration of Vivian's life and the change that she dedicated it to achieving, in order to make the world a better place.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8053671" data-originallang="en">May her memory be a blessing.</p>
