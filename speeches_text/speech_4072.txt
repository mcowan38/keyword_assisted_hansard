<p data-HoCid="8396562" data-originallang="en"> On the issue of the Palestinians—in particular, I think you're referring to the possible displacement of people from Rafah—our position on that is very clear. We oppose any military action against innocent civilians in Rafah, because they have nowhere else to go; therefore, they're staying and seeking refuge in Rafah. We've made that very clear. </p>
