<p data-HoCid="8563682" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, it is an honour to rise to speak to Bill <a data-HoCid="12261855" href="/bills/44-1/C-319/" title="An Act to amend the Old Age Security Act (amount of full pension)">C-319</a>, an act to amend the Old Age Security Act. I want to thank the sponsor, my colleague from <a data-HoCid="278737" href="/politicians/andreanne-larouche/" title="Andréanne Larouche">Shefford</a> for moving this bill. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8563683" data-originallang="en">The bill before us today is about increasing old age security by 10% for those who are between the ages of 65 and 74. These people were initially excluded by the Liberal government when the government decided to increase the OAS for seniors. The government decided to create a two-tiered system of seniors, those who were over 75 and those who were under 75. Those aged between 65 and 74 were going to be penalized and not get the increase. This is similar to what the Conservatives did when they raised the retirement age from 65 to 67. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8563684" data-originallang="en">We are seeing a pattern of both Liberals and Conservatives wanting seniors to work longer, and this was no different. Seniors deserve better. Many seniors across the country do not have the resources to deal with the high cost of housing and the increase in inflation, especially those who are on fixed incomes. They are the ones bearing the brunt of this. I would argue that seniors and people living with disabilities are feeling the pinch the most. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8563685" data-originallang="en">Increasing the exemption for income from employment or self-employment is also important in the calculation of the guaranteed income supplement, from $5,000 to $6,500, which is also incorporated into this bill. We want to make sure seniors who do wish to participate in the workforce are not being penalized. We know we need to do more, which is why the NDP put forward a dental care plan and a plan for pharmacare, so seniors are not making the choice of whether they are going to buy food or take the medicine they need. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8563686" data-originallang="en">We are going to continue to work on ideas to help lift seniors out of poverty and ensure they have the best retirement possible, and a retirement with dignity. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8563687" data-originallang="en">In 2021, when the Liberals brought in the 10% bonus for seniors 75 and over, they decided to leave some seniors out, and they created those two categories I discussed earlier. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8563688" data-originallang="en">I am hoping we can move this bill forward quickly. This is a minority Parliament. To make this minority Parliament work, this is clearly a really important aspect of that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8563689" data-originallang="en">I also want to speak about the cost of this. I have raised this in the House of Commons many times since the Liberals brought in this two-tiered benefit for seniors and neglected those who were over 65 and under 74. I have raised this also at the government operations committee, where I have asked the former president of the Treasury Board and the current <a data-HoCid="300030" href="/politicians/anita-anand/" title="Anita Anand">President of the Treasury Board</a> to re-examine this. I helped her break down the numbers, because we know that she knows we have the lowest corporate taxes in the G7. That was something the Harper government did. It did not do that for small business. It lowered corporate taxes by 5%. We have seen corporate taxes drop from 28% to 15%, from the Chrétien era to today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8563690" data-originallang="en">The Liberals have maintained that low corporate tax rate while oil and gas, big grocery and big banks have had record profits. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8563691" data-originallang="en">The Liberals have also failed to tackle the issue around tax havens. The Parliamentary Budget Officer, in 2019, calculated that between $21 billion and $26 billion a year was being lost to tax havens. The ultrarich get these tax benefits, but seniors who are trying to retire with dignity are being targeted. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8563692" data-originallang="en">In 2021, it was projected that $31 billion was leaking from the Canadian economy so the ultrarich and CEOs could get off the hook again while seniors struggled to make ends meet. What did the government do? It hired more people at CRA, but the people at CRA are focusing on small business people, on people struggling to make ends meet and seniors. Seniors in my riding have come to me and told me that the government is coming after them for small amounts of money, when in fact the government could have hired auditors at CRA to target those who are manoeuvring around the tax system to benefit themselves, the super rich and these big corporations. Instead, the government is focused on everyday people, and that needs to change.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8563693" data-originallang="en">This is an excellent bill and an excellent start. I have some ideas on how we can cover it because it is projected to cost $3 billion. Back in 2015, the PBO projected that a 1% increase in corporate tax would be about $2.6 billion. I would argue that that would be around the same amount today. Therefore, a 1% increase in corporate tax would cover the costs of taking care of our seniors. What will the government do? We know the Liberals and the Conservatives. They are always going to be there for the big corporations and their friends and are not going to do that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8563694" data-originallang="en">The NDP was able to apply pressure to increase the excess profit tax on the big banks. That was a 15% tax on profits of over a billion dollars. That generated billions of dollars, that windfall tax. The PBO did an analysis of the government applying that tax to big oil and gas, which would generate a profit of $4.2 billion. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8563695" data-originallang="en">We know that Conservatives in the U.K. charge an excess profit tax, a windfall tax, on oil and gas. We cannot even get the Liberals to do that in Canada. The oil oligarchy here is always arguing in the House of Commons about who can build more pipelines between the two of them. I can tell members that they are both good at building pipelines, but they are not good at tackling climate change. They are also not good at taking care of seniors. We know that right across the country. We are seeing that constantly. Therefore, I urge the government to look at an excess profit tax, at closing tax loopholes for the super-rich and for tax havens, and at possibly increasing the corporate tax rate. It should not be like this for seniors.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8563696" data-originallang="en"> I got an email from Janice from my riding. She writes:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8563697" data-originallang="en"> I must ask, why is it seniors collecting cpp and old age pensions receive less than CERB? </p>
<p data-HoCid="8563698" data-originallang="en"> The federal government stated they felt $2000.00/month a livable wage yet many seniors are receiving substantially less. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8563699" data-originallang="en"> Many seniors are living silently in poverty. Are there any plans to address this shameful situation? </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8563700" data-originallang="en">She wrote about being excluded from the OAS increase. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8563701" data-originallang="en">Today, with the bill put forward by my colleague from <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>, we had the opportunity for an annual basic income. The Liberals and Conservatives could have got behind that bill. They could have, at committee, prioritized people living with disabilities and seniors, the most vulnerable in our society, but they chose not to. It would have made sense.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8563702" data-originallang="en">When I ask people in my communities whether they think we should continue the corporate welfare that is happening with tax havens, with the lowest corporate tax rate in the G7, with the continued focus of CRA audits on everyday people while the big players get off the hook, and with preferential tax rates for CEOs. Everybody who I have talked to in my riding believes that we should be prioritizing taking care of our seniors and those living with disabilities. A guaranteed livable income could have done that, but the Liberals chose not to do that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8563703" data-originallang="en">We are going to continue to come here to the House to bring forward good ideas.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8563704" data-originallang="en"> I am really grateful to the Bloc for bringing forward this initiative. I do appreciate my colleague using her spot in the order of precedence to move the bill. We will be supporting this bill wholeheartedly. I hope everybody in the House does, and that we can move it quickly, because people are struggling right now. Seniors are struggling with how they are going to pay their rent, buy food and get their medicine. I am glad we are able to take some pressure off of them with dental care, but we know that, with the rising cost of inflation, they cannot keep up with it. Therefore, I hope we can move this rapidly along here today, and in the weeks ahead. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8563705" data-originallang="en">I want to thank my colleague one last time for moving the bill. </p>
