<p data-HoCid="8301120" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301121" data-originallang="en">We have a number of studies that have been proposed by members around the table, one of which—and I think it's a very important one—is the study proposed by Mr. Housefather dealing with anti-Semitism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301122" data-originallang="en">I'm prepared to support his study without any amendment. I think the original motion is one that was brought to us some time ago. It's kind of in the queue with other studies that have been proposed. If other people want to have other studies on other issues, they're welcome to bring those forward for consideration by the committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301123" data-originallang="en">In light of Mr. Housefather's willingness to get consensus around the table, I am happy to also support his amended version. I'll note that it gives us one less day to study anti-Semitism, but I think it's a goodwill effort for us to not monopolize all the remaining time left on studies when there are others that are in the queue that are also important.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301124" data-originallang="en">I do want to make it clear that I'm happy to support Mr. Housefather's original motion that we study anti-Semitism, but I'm also willing to support this amended and subamended motion as currently written.</p>
