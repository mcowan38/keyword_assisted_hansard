<p data-HoCid="6956312" data-originallang="en">Fantastic. You guys are right up and on board.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6956313" data-originallang="en">Thank you so much to our three witnesses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6956314" data-originallang="en">We're now going to move over to questions and answers. Today we start off with a six-minute round. I'll put my finger up at five minutes, and that's just reminding the person who is questioning that they have one minute left to get a question and answer out there. At five minutes I'll be giving you a mark, and for anybody else, a minute out.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6956315" data-originallang="en">Our first round starts off with Michelle Ferreri, Marc Serr√©, Louise Chabot and then Leah Gazan.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6956316" data-originallang="en">Michelle, you have the floor for six minutes.</p>
