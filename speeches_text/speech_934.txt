<p data-HoCid="6701807" data-originallang="en">Mr. Fadden, I will go back to you, please, for a moment. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6701808" data-originallang="en">We were talking briefly about academic activities involving Chinese researchers. You said at one point that you can't go down the rabbit hole of suspecting every Chinese student coming to Canada. However, you go further than most people in saying that there are 10 or so areas of study with national security implications, suggesting that Chinese students would not then be able to study in Canada and that there should not be any research collaboration with them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6701809" data-originallang="en">Could you identify those 10 areas, or some of them, if they come to mind quickly, and tell us how is it that you have such a hard line on that? How do you justify that, or how would Canada justify that?</p>
