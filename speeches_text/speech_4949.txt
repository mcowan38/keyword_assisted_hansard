<p data-HoCid="8604022" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8604023" data-originallang="en">Thank you to the witnesses for their powerful and sobering testimony. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8604024" data-originallang="en">Briefings that I received on the crisis in Sudan suggest that the ongoing violence, combined with the humanitarian consequences, makes this likely to be the worst humanitarian crisis since the so-called “Great Leap Forward” in China in the 1950s. You talked about a scenario of mass starvation, potentially up to 12 million or 13 million people next year. To put that in context, that is well over five times the total population of the Gaza Strip. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8604025" data-originallang="en">I don't think very many Canadians are aware of the particulars of this crisis. I think it would be deeply troubling to many Canadians to find out some of the facts you shared. Tens of millions of people are affected by acute hunger already and, at a minimum, this is a situation that requires our serious attention and intense resolve and response. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8604026" data-originallang="en">It seems to me, based on what I read in your testimony today, that a critical step forward is to do more to block the flow of arms into Sudan by shaming and penalizing any country or non-state actor sending weapons to either side. Just briefly, do both witnesses agree with that in principle? </p>
