<p data-HoCid="8284451" data-originallang="en">In terms of UNRWA, just to set the record straight, my understanding on the dates is <a data-HoCid="300012" href="/politicians/ahmed-hussen/" title="Ahmed Hussen">Mr. Hussen</a> announced that we would be pausing future funding to UNRWA on December 6 and more recently in March. But don't take my dates here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8284452" data-originallang="en">Several weeks ago, if not months, <a data-HoCid="300012" href="/politicians/ahmed-hussen/" title="Ahmed Hussen">Minister Hussen</a> announced that we would pause future funding to UNRWA because of allegations of 12 employees who were involved in the October 7 attack.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8284453" data-originallang="en">More recently, in March, <a data-HoCid="300012" href="/politicians/ahmed-hussen/" title="Ahmed Hussen">Minister Hussen</a> unpaused the future installment.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8284454" data-originallang="en">I'm not asking about that specific issue but about the issue of our humanitarian aid to Gaza in this conflict, because I think there's a lack of clarity on that in Canada and for Canadians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8284455" data-originallang="en">My understanding is we did pause future payments, but that payment was not due until a future date. In reality, to support humanitarian endeavours, we have increased funding and the funding for UNRWA was never cut, although we were going to do so if we did get down to the issue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8284456" data-originallang="en">Is that correct?</p>
