<p data-HoCid="8223007" data-originallang="en"> I know I have a different opinion from that of many people within Global Affairs, but I did not believe that it was particularly good for the diplomatic and development portions of our foreign affairs to have Global Affairs all be in one place, because I feel that trade has trumped the ability of our diplomacy and our development to take a meaningful place within our foreign policy. It's something I've seen for a long time that worries me. I know you've said there are some real benefits to having it in one place, and I'm sure there are, but there are obviously things that are lost if we don't recognize the value of diplomacy and development as well as our trade relationships.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8223008" data-originallang="en">Senator Boehm, I hope you'll forgive me, but I'm going to move a motion now, because this is what we have to do when we want to move things. That will probably take the rest of my time, but I read your report with a lot of interest, and I do thank you for coming before the committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8223009" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, I will be moving the motion that I distributed to the committee on February 5 on military goods and technology exports to Israel, and I will be asking for a recorded vote on that, if I could.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8223010" data-originallang="en"> I move:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8223011" data-originallang="en"> That, pursuant to Standing Order 108(1)(a), and given that the value of military goods and technology exports to Israel from Canada exceeded $21 million in 2022, and that there were 315 utilized export permits and a further 199 authorized for military goods and technology to Israel reported in the 2022 “Report on the Export of Military Goods”, the committee order Global Affairs Canada to produce all documents, briefing notes, memorandums and emails within the department, including the Minister of Foreign Affairs’ office, and between the department and the Department of National Defence, the Canadian Commercial Corporation, the Privy Council Office and the Prime Minister's Office related to the granting of any export or brokering permits for military goods and technology to Israel between 2020 and 2024, within 30 days of the adoption of this motion; and that these documents be provided to the committee without redactions except to protect cabinet confidences. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8223012" data-originallang="en">Obviously, this is something I'd like us to vote on right now. I'm happy to speak to it and say, basically, that this committee made a similar request a few years ago regarding Canadian military exports to Turkey. That resulted in important information that was made public and a study by this committee that led Canada to suspend military exports to Turkey—an action that we, of course, have seen reversed this month.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8223013" data-originallang="en">I have another motion on arms exports to India that I will be moving at another time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8223014" data-originallang="en"> I have been asking for clear answers on military exports to Israel for a long time. I have not been able to get any accurate answers, including to an Order Paper question for which I received two identical answers to two very separate questions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8223015" data-originallang="en">I have received more than 250,000 emails in my inbox on this issue. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8223016" data-originallang="en">I would like us to have a recorded vote on this motion. Thank you.</p>
