<p data-HoCid="7774208" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Chair and honourable members, it's really a great honour and great privilege to be given the opportunity to say a few words. It would be remiss of me not to thank two great Canadians, two great democrats, whom I have the honour of having to my left and my right, the Honourable Irwin Cotler and Allan Rock. They are friends of justice in every situation, and I am really privileged to have their support.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7774209" data-originallang="en">I'm giving the Elie Wiesel lecture this evening, at the invitation of both. I think it's very appropriate because the ICC is a child of Nuremberg. The ICC was born as a testament to man's inhumanity to his fellow man, woman and child, and the promise of “Never again”, which should have compelled greater action after the Holocaust, remains an urgent need, because we see it with the Rohingya. We see it in the DRC. We see it in Ukraine. We see it in so many parts of the world.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7774210" data-originallang="en">We're very lucky. I feel very privileged to be here in Canada, because Canada has a distinguished record of being among the very strongest supporters of international law, not by way of words but by way of deeds.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7774211" data-originallang="en">Philippe Kirsch was the first president of the ICC. The current vice-president of the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute is another great Canadian, Bob Rae. I count on his support every day in terms of his stewardship and vice-chairmanship of the assembly. The last president of the ICC was Chile Eboe-Osuji, who is a Canadian as well as a Nigerian. My special adviser on genocide, Professor Payam Akhavan, is another Canadian and the co-chair of the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7774212" data-originallang="en">I think that every moment, perhaps, can be seen as critical, and they are critical. Every moment, every generation, has different challenges, different opportunities, and history then decides whether the generations of the past rose to the challenges and exceeded expectations or failed. Did they not manage to live up to the demands of the hour? I think that is a critical issue now, when we see so many conflagrations in different parts of the world. We see the brutality of sexual and gender-based violence, the crime of persecution, the dislocation and deportation of the most vulnerable of our population—children—in so many different situations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7774213" data-originallang="en"> I think the ICC has an important role to play. We cannot be pedestrian. We cannot simply be a court espousing the importance of normative values. We have to show the impact of international justice where it is most needed and at the time it is most needed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7774214" data-originallang="en">Since I became prosecutor, we have tried with great alacrity to focus on field presence. We have an interview facility in Cox's Bazar, where I was on February 24, when the Russian Federation invaded Ukraine. We have an agreement with President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian authorities to have an office in Kyiv. We're trying, with all the difficulties we have in Khartoum and in Tripoli, to have a field presence, and I have an agreement to have an office in Caracas.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7774215" data-originallang="en">Being close to the people isn't politics. It is essential to understand the demands of criminal justice, that we cannot succeed, cannot prove cases beyond reasonable doubt, unless we know the undercurrents, the history, the culture, the politics, the connections. We can't do that by big legal paratroopers parachuting into hotels for a few weeks and then flying out. We need to be with the people to learn, study and then collaborate. The other aspect is partnerships. The idea that the ICC is an apex court is legally wrong. It's built upon complementarity. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7774216" data-originallang="en">The revolution that we're in the midst of in the office to transform the eDiscovery system is, I think, absolutely necessary and long overdue. One cannot deal with this digital age with analog tools. The ability to use voice-to-text transcription, automated translation, and facial identification will give us the tools to ingest far more information. Not only will this allow us to build stronger cases and to investigate incriminating and exonerating evidence equally—as we're required to do—but it will also allow us to be a hub to give information to national authorities. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7774217" data-originallang="en">One thing I said before Ukraine—I said it before I was elected—was that I care not a jot about which flag is behind an independent judge, whether it's the flag of Canada or the ICC, whether it's the flag of Columbia or the flag of the Central African Republic. What victims need at this moment, what societies feel at this moment—when their trust in international institutions, whether it's the United Nations, the ICC or even member states, is not what we would hope it to be—is to see action and that their lives matter. They need to feel, when they're exposed to the elements and exposed to bullets, machetes, bombs or missiles, that the law provides them a shelter.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7774218" data-originallang="en">I think if we do that, then maybe, when we give up our current responsibilities and move on, the generations and leaders that come after us will think that we did our best and we didn't fall short of the needs of this present moment in time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7774219" data-originallang="en">Thank you so much.</p>
