<p data-HoCid="8245724" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, today I rise to mark the 150th anniversary of the city of Westmount. Since 1874, Westmount's beautiful parks, bustling schools, CEGEPs, synagogues, churches, community centres and outdoor rinks, as well as our 125-year-old library, the first publicly funded library in Quebec, have all helped to foster a deep sense of community and identity. Westmount is like a small town in a big city.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8245725" data-originallang="fr">I would like to thank the many volunteers and municipal staff members, as well as the mayor, Christina Smith, and the city council for their leadership and dedication to Westmount's past, present and future.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8245726" data-originallang="fr">Congratulations and happy 150th anniversary to Westmount.</p>
