<p data-HoCid="7732868" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Chair, when people are experiencing violence, not having a home and not being able to leave keeps them in that cycle of violence. Obviously there has to be more funding and solutions to provide housing for women.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7732869" data-originallang="fr">We are talking about women, but I believe my colleague from <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> would agree that this affects the whole community. Children are also affected when they are in crowded living conditions, and every aspect of life is affected. Housing really is a key issue. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7732870" data-originallang="fr">The Standing Committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs studied this issue and discussed it with the minister. We realized he means well, but at the same time, there was an admission during the committee that the shortfall would never be eliminated. There is already a shortage, and there will be no way to meet growing demand. These populations are very young, and they need safe places to live.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7732871" data-originallang="fr">There is not enough money and not enough housing being built. We need concrete measures.</p>
