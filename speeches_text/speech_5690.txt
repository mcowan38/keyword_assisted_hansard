<p data-HoCid="8784269" data-originallang="en"> When it comes to the Canadian Human Rights Act, I think it's the application of the act. It needs to be applied in a manner that coalesces with Canada's anti-racism strategy. When you talk about anti-Semitism and the Canadian Human Rights Act, it must be interpreted in relation to Canada's definition of anti-Semitism, the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism.</p>
