<p data-HoCid="6791942" data-originallang="en"> Thanks very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791943" data-originallang="en">Yes, I would say Egypt played a critical role in helping bring about the ceasefire with extensive conversations and negotiations with the Israelis and with Hamas and others. I think they really carried the weight of this burden in this latest conflict.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791944" data-originallang="en">We had a team that went into Gaza just a couple of days ago. They could see Egyptian flags and pictures of President Sisi in a number of places. I think the Gazans really appreciated President Sisi's direct intervention. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6791945" data-originallang="en">The Egyptians have done this a number of times over the past few years as the conflicts have increased. They're certainly an important player for how we can engage to build peace in that relationship. Jordan's another key player. They're the two that have had peace treaties with Israel for some time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791946" data-originallang="en">We are talking with the Egyptians and our <a data-HoCid="271244" href="/politicians/marc-garneau/" title="Marc Garneau">foreign minister</a> has had recent discussions with his Egyptian counterpart. Egypt is absolutely one key partner in the region and one that we'll continue to engage.</p>
