<p data-HoCid="8303315" data-originallang="en">It goes further than school. I think the vast majority of Canadians, before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, had no idea about the Holodomor—the systemic creation of famine to kill millions of Ukrainians. Canadians did not know about that or about how the Ukrainian community here was impacted by this. Similarly, a number of people, especially young people, have no idea about the Holocaust, how it came about and what flew out from the Holocaust: the creation of all the international infrastructure, the protection of human rights and all of that stuff.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303316" data-originallang="en">Yes, schools have to do a better job. The Province of Ontario, for example, made Holocaust education mandatory. That is good. I think different genocides that happened—the Holodomor, the Rwandan genocide, the Armenian genocide and others—have to be better taught not only to kids but to all Canadians. That is why the executive director of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress mentioned the work that's been done.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303317" data-originallang="en">Since the House adopted April as Genocide Remembrance, Condemnation and Prevention Month, there's been a lot of work done between the Ukrainian and Jewish communities, and other communities as well. This is the type of, I guess, public awareness where you, as members of Parliament and the federal government, have a role to play.</p>
