<p data-HoCid="7546872" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, after eight years of this <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, the reality is that Canadians are suffering more and more, despite the fine words and promises made to the middle class. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7546873" data-originallang="fr">I visited the food banks in Thetford Mines, Lac‑Mégantic, Plessisville, Princeville and Disraeli. What I heard broke my heart. Demand for food bank services skyrocketed by over 30% in December. That is the result of eight years under a Liberal government.</p>
