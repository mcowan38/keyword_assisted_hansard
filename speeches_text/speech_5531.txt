<p data-HoCid="8703357" data-originallang="fr">I thank Mr. Bergeron and all my colleagues for giving me this opportunity.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703358" data-originallang="en">My question would be to return to some of the remarks we've heard.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703359" data-originallang="en"> A number of academics and in fact all three panellists here have said that the right time to recognize two states is now. There is no possibility of a two-state solution without recognizing that there are two states.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703360" data-originallang="en"> In the previous panel, we had some put forward the idea that there should be conditions. That's what the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="MÃ©lanie Joly">foreign affairs minister</a> has also most recently said. I asked the question to those panellists who put that question forward. I think we'd really benefit from hearing your perspective.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703361" data-originallang="en"> Dr. Awad, maybe you can start. If I have time, Mr. Balsam can go next.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703362" data-originallang="en">What is your response to those who say there should be conditions before Palestine can be recognized as a state?</p>
