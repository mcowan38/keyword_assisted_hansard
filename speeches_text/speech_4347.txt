<p data-HoCid="8453796" data-originallang="en"> <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Justin Trudeau</a> was asked on Friday last week if the government would support the International Criminal Court. His answer was, “The ICJ's proposals are binding and we expect everyone to follow them as a matter of international law.” </p>
