<p data-HoCid="8340203" data-originallang="en"> I think it's important to focus on whether or not the historical context here was understood properly, which is why I led with that in my opening remarks. Certainly the Speaker ultimately resigned and apologized and in his resignation recognized the Jewish and Polish communities, so we appreciate that. Certainly when it comes to the other event—and I understand there was some discussion, at previous committee meetings, about a particular stakeholder involved—I hope there would still be an opportunity to get further clarity on that question.</p>
