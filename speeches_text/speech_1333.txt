<p class="procedural" data-HoCid="6912183"> moved for leave to introduce Bill <a data-HoCid="11471425" href="/bills/44-1/C-229/">C-229, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (banning symbols of hate)</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6912184" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, last weekend we all saw the appalling images of Nazi flags being waved on Parliament Hill, just steps away from the sacred Hall of Honour where we commemorate the 45,000 Canadians who gave their lives fighting Nazism. Today I am tabling an act to amend the Criminal Code to ban symbols of hate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6912185" data-originallang="fr">All parliamentarians must support this bill and speak with one voice to ensure that swastikas can no longer be legally displayed in the very seat of our democracy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6912186" data-originallang="en">These despicable Nazi and vile racist symbols of hate signify the worst depravity in human history: the Holocaust, with millions of victims of the most unspeakable acts of racism and hate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6912187" data-originallang="en">Other countries have banned these symbols to preserve their democracy. It is time for Canada to do the same. I hope all MPs will come together for the speedy passage of the bill, so that never again will Nazi flags fly legally on Parliament Hill or anywhere else in Canada.</p>
