<p data-HoCid="6637072" data-originallang="en">Azerbaijan has been acquiring a number of weapon systems for the past, I'd say, 10 to 15 years. In fact, many were wondering what the reason for the stockpile was. It seemed to be that.... Those who are watching the region thought that indeed they were going to try to take back this region.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6637073" data-originallang="en">They've been investing very heavily. They have of course been buying mostly Israeli technology. There is a bit of Turkish technology, but most of their weapon systems are Israeli.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6637074" data-originallang="en">I think Azerbaijan is a country that has a lot of wealth, and it is certainly increasingly trying to play up its nationalistic base. The president is very much a nationalist, and this was a very popular war by the standards of most Azeris.</p>
