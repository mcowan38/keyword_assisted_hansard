<p data-HoCid="8698180" data-originallang="en"> I have a final question before we go too far down the rabbit hole. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8698181" data-originallang="en">It cost us $34 billion. Are you going to get that money back, or are you going to strike the debt as some kind of national reconciliation, fighting Putin, saving the planet initiative? Are we getting our $34 billion back? How are we going to get it back if we're not getting 100% of the tolls?</p>
