<p data-HoCid="6996537" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, another Yiddish proverb comes to mind: The best way to know a man is to watch him when he is angry. We have seen far too many angry people in this place as we discuss the Emergencies Act.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6996538" data-originallang="en">I would put to the member the statute again, because he seemed to infer in his remarks that Canadians should be suspicious about a committee that has to meet in secret. I draw his attention to the definition of “threats to the security of Canada” within the act. It is a defined term found in the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act, and it is all about things that would be regarded as secret, such as espionage and sabotage. The one that I think applies here says:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="6996539" data-originallang="en"> foreign influenced activities within or relating to Canada that are detrimental to the interests of Canada and are clandestine or deceptive </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="6996540" data-originallang="en">It is very likely that if we look at the real threat to the security of Canada, the manifestation of a deep unpleasantness for the people of Ottawa is one aspect. However, the aspect that drew me to decide to vote yes was the disinformation that came from foreign sources. Looking into that is inherently going to require security clearance, and it is required as well by the act for this committee. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6996541" data-originallang="en">I would love to ask the member for Calgary Shepard if he recognizes that the committee is required by the act to meet in secret and that it makes sense given the security implications of the definition of a public order emergency found in the act.</p>
