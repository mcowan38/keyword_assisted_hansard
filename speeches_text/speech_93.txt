<p data-HoCid="6018398" data-originallang="en">I am incredibly proud that Canada is one of Israel's strongest allies at the UN and many other international organizations. We are opposed to efforts that unfairly single out Israel for criticism and seek to isolate it internationally. We agree that there are too many resolutions related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We have called on the international community to channel its efforts toward helping both sides to resume direct negotiations and work toward achieving a lasting peace for both peoples.</p>
