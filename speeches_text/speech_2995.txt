<p data-HoCid="8018831" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Chair. I appreciate that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8018832" data-originallang="en">Thank you to the committee. Interestingly enough, that conversation and little charade that was pulled off there by the NDP member, Mr. Julian, took almost eight minutes. I was just about ready to wrap up my comments at six minutes. Again, let the record show that the frustration taking place at this committee is at the hands of the NDP member.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8018833" data-originallang="en">I came forward with a very straightforward motion asking for Ms. Tait to appear here for three hours so that we would have sufficient time to be able to ask her questions with regard to her mandate as the CEO of the CBC. That is my question. I'm further outlining a few, a very few, of the concerns that I have with regard to the CBC and with what I would say is their biased coverage with regard to the war in Gaza. Of course, there are many other topics that we would wish to ask her about as well.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8018834" data-originallang="en">At the end of the day, it comes down to two words. Ms. Tait has said that the CBC is committed to telling the “truth”, and Ms. Tait has said that it is important to restore “trust” in journalism. The CBC has not told the truth in many of its articles that it has released. In particular, one comes to mind with regard to the war in Gaza. With regard to the second thing, that of trust, she is right that the Canadian public does deserve the restoration of trust. That will take place when the CBC refuses to continue to perpetuate its biased coverage, actually looks at multiple sources and covers the news from multiple angles.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8018835" data-originallang="en">We'll give her the opportunity to answer questions in this regard when she comes on Thursday. We would ask that it be three hours long.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8018836" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
