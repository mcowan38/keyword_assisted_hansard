<p data-HoCid="8576839" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I always enjoy the member's speeches. It is nice to know that there is at least one voice of common sense in the entire Liberal caucus.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576840" data-originallang="en"> I do have one question. It has to do with the issue of his government saying that Israel has the right to defend itself, but that it is not going to help it defend itself, it is not going to sell it arms. I just think that is so hypocritical. It cannot say, on the one hand, that Israel has the right to defend itself, but on the other hand, that it is not going to give it the means to defend itself. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8576841" data-originallang="en">I know we could argue that it would get its arms somewhere else, but the point is what Canada does sets an example for the world. What this policy really means is that the people who brought it forward want every country in the world to follow suit, which would be a disaster for Israel and really be a problem. I would like the member's comments on that one particular issue.</p>
