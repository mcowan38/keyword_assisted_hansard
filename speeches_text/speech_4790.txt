<p data-HoCid="8567784" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8567785" data-originallang="en">I want to say thank you to the translators for all the work they're doing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8567786" data-originallang="en"> First of all, I'm very happy to have everybody here. I'm thankful to my colleagues for agreeing to bring forward this important study. This is an issue that is really important to my constituents but also to Canadians across the country. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8567787" data-originallang="en">As you know better than I do, the issue is different depending on where you are in Canada, but it very much is a prominent issue across Canada in general. However, we know the issue is that we have many more vessels on the west coast, but I'm going down a rabbit hole of things I didn't want to start talking about yet.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8567788" data-originallang="en">Ms. Nghiem, I believe you're out on the water. Are you seeing these vessels first-hand?</p>
