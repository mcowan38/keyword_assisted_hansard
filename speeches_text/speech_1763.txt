<p data-HoCid="7194848" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, vaginas and vulvas are a source of strength, empowerment and pleasure, yet throughout our lives we have been taught that the terms “vulva” and “vagina” do not have a place in polite conversation. That is one more way that the bodies of over half the world’s population are stigmatized, sexualized and objectified. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7194849" data-originallang="en">With the recent news in the United States regarding Roe v. Wade, conversations about sexual and reproductive health are more important than ever, and they start here on Parliament Hill. We need to reclaim space in health research, in politics, in policy-making and at the doctor’s office to celebrate the power of vulvas and vaginas. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7194850" data-originallang="en">It is 2022, and we should not be embarrassed or ashamed to talk about our bodies. Join me, the MPs for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>, <a data-HoCid="278722" href="/politicians/elizabeth-may/" title="Elizabeth May">Saanich—Gulf Islands</a> and <a data-HoCid="278737" href="/politicians/andreanne-larouche/" title="Andréanne Larouche">Shefford</a>, Senator McPhedran and Action Canada as we jointly host a celebration on May 31 to reclaim the conversation and celebrate vulvas and vaginas as powerful and important.</p>
