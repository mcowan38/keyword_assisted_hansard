<p data-HoCid="8074415" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the loss of innocent lives in the Middle East as a result of the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas has been tragic. There is an increasingly dire need to ensure that aid gets into Gaza, where civilians are suffering. Canadians want to know how the government is helping bring relief to the region.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8074416" data-originallang="en"> Can the Minister of International Development please update the House and Canadians on what the government is doing to provide help to those people desperately in need?</p>
