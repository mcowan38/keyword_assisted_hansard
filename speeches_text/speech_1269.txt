<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">Madam Chair, I see that the minister is avoiding the question on Palestine.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">A few days ago, at the United Nations General Assembly, Canada voted against three resolutions on Palestine. The first was on the peace process, the second was on the Syrian Golan, which is indirectly related, and the third was on Jerusalem. Each time, Canada was in the minority in the international community.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">In the case of the peace process, Canada was part of a select group of nine countries. Other than Australia, the United States and Israel itself, there was Hungary, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru and Palau. We were in distinguished company with nine votes against 148 in favour of this resolution.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">Since Canada is against the illegal occupation of Palestinian territories, since Canada is against colonization and expulsions, since Canada is in favour of a two-state solution and since Canada condemns the attacks against civilians, including rocket attacks, what did Canada have against motion A/74/L.14, which was supported, I might add, by Norway and Ireland, which were elected to the Security Council?</p>
