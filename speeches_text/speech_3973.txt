<p data-HoCid="8324983" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to say one thing that I did not have the chance to say in my main speech.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8324984" data-originallang="en">It was published today that the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">foreign affairs minister</a> was speaking with her counterpart in Israel. She said to him, “take the win”. Can members imagine?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8324985" data-originallang="en">I wonder what my friend from <a data-HoCid="278257" href="/politicians/kevin-lamoureux/" title="Kevin Lamoureux">Winnipeg North</a> would say if this happened in Canada, around Winnipeg. Should we de-escalate? Should we just take the win? We happen to have the technology to knock them down.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8324986" data-originallang="en">With friends like these Liberals, who needs enemies?</p>
