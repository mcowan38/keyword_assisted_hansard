<p data-HoCid="7988453" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7988454" data-originallang="en">I want to join Mr. Oliphant in thanking the department and the officials for all the work you've been doing over the last few weeks and what you're going to go through going forward. We really appreciate your efforts and your concern for Canadians abroad and how you are taking care of them and getting them home or into a safe location at least. We know it may be even tougher going forward, so we just want to thank you for that work.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988455" data-originallang="en">That leads into my next question. We see what's going on with Lebanon, and I want to look at the purely humanitarian aspect. There's a time and a place for judging who's right and who's wrong and what was done right and what was done wrong. Right now we have families being ripped apart. We have kids being killed. What can we do to help that? </p>
<p data-HoCid="7988456" data-originallang="en">I understand the unique situation in Gaza, where it's very restricted, but in Lebanon, are there things we could proactively be doing to make sure that if we did see that situation escalate, we'd actually have supplies on the ground and we'd be able to meet the humanitarian needs in that area at that point in time? </p>
