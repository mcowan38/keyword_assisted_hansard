<p data-HoCid="6434368" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6434369" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Minister Lametti and Minister Chagger, for your appearance here today at the justice committee. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6434370" data-originallang="en">Minister Lametti, I want to jump right into the definition, because we're trying to get a bill here that does what you, in your press conference, said it would do and what your department has said it would do, but there is uncertainty around the definition. This bill hangs on the definition. I heard you say five minutes ago that your best minds put together this bill, and then I heard you say a minute ago that you missed something there in syncing up with Bill <a data-HoCid="8269852" href="/bills/42-1/C-16/" title="An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code">C-16</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6434371" data-originallang="en">In the early discussion on this bill, much was said about your comments and the justice department's website, which laid out what the bill did not do. It said, “personal views on sexual orientation, sexual feelings or gender identity are expressed such as where teachers, school counsellors, pastoral counsellors, faith leaders, doctors, mental health professionals, friends or family members provide support to persons struggling with their sexual orientation, sexual feelings, or gender identity.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="6434372" data-originallang="en">There have been some—today I saw a brief from the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs—who have said, “Look, we're 100% against conversion therapy, but for greater certainty”—I know you believe in “greater certainty” clauses, because there are two of them in this very bill—“would you include the language that you've spoken in this bill?”</p>
<p data-HoCid="6434373" data-originallang="en">I do want to give you the opportunity to answer a question that was put to justice department officials. Once it became public that people said “Please put this in the bill”, the department website changed. Instead of saying “friends or family members provide support”, the word “affirming” was added in there. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6434374" data-originallang="en">I want to know what the background on that is. Why was the website changed? I think this plays into some of the fears that people have around this bill. Just two years ago, your government said this bill wasn't necessary because it was handled at the provincial level, and you said you didn't have clear statistics on it, but we now have a Criminal Code amendment. The Criminal Code is the highest sanction we as a government can bring against people, so we want to make sure that this bill does what you said it would do. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6434375" data-originallang="en">Why was that changed on the website, Minister?</p>
