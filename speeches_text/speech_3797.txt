<p data-HoCid="8300865" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Garrison, for your leadership on the first part of what you talked about and the courage that you continue to show as a parliamentarian, and also for your leadership and that of <a data-HoCid="278625" href="/politicians/laurel-collins/" title="Laurel Collins">Laurel Collins</a> on coercive control.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300866" data-originallang="en">In terms of supporting victims, we are constantly and actively thinking about how to better support victims, including victims of intimate partner violence. Please take a cue from what we did in Bill <a data-HoCid="9745407" href="/bills/42-1/C-75/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code, the Youth Criminal Justice Act and other Acts and to make consequential amendments to other Acts">C-75</a> and in Bill <a data-HoCid="12426046" href="/bills/44-1/C-48/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (bail reform)">C-48</a> with respect to the reverse onus on bail for survivors of intimate partner violence. Issues about support and funding are always on the table. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8300867" data-originallang="en">Also, please understand that when you talk about a 24-hour takedown of things like revenge porn, you're dealing with an aspect of coercive control that exists right now. That's in Bill <a data-HoCid="12913297" href="/bills/44-1/C-63/" title="An Act to enact the Online Harms Act, to amend the Criminal Code, the Canadian Human Rights Act and An Act respecting the mandatory reporting of Internet child pornography by persons who provide an Internet service and to make consequential and related amendments to other Acts">C-63</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300868" data-originallang="en">You also mentioned, in your opening, hearing from voices. I think two of the most salient voices that I heard from were the two that were at the press conference with me: Jane, the mother of a child who has been sexually abused and repeatedly exploited online, and Carla Beauvais, a woman who has been intimidated and has retreated from participating in the public space.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300869" data-originallang="en">I would also suggest taking your cues from the groups that were also there beside me. The National Council of Canadian Muslims and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs have, in the last six months, not seen eye to eye on a lot of issues. On this bill, they do see eye to eye. They both support this, as do the special envoys on anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. Those are important voices to be hearing from, and that's what I will continue to do.</p>
