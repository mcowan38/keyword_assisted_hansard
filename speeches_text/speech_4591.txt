<p data-HoCid="8499216" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair, and allow me to start off by thanking our witnesses. I have to confess that I found your opening remarks very helpful, in particular the distinction between anti-Palestinian hate and Islamophobia, as well as the need to look at this from a comparative context. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8499217" data-originallang="en">Obviously Islamophobia, regrettably, is alive and well, and it's incumbent upon all of us to take it very seriously, especially on a day like this, the third anniversary of the tragic incident in London.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8499218" data-originallang="en">I will start off with a question for Professor Zine. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8499219" data-originallang="en">Professor Zine, we heard that, arguably, Islamophobia is raging here in Canada more than it is in other jurisdictions around the world and in other G7 countries. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8499220" data-originallang="en">First, would you agree with that? Second, to the extent that this may very well be true, why is that? Could you kindly advise as to what it is that we're not doing sufficiently in Canada? </p>
