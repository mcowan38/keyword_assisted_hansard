<p data-HoCid="8546935" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8546936" data-originallang="en"> I want to correct the record. The PCO officials said the minutes were transitory records and wouldn't exist at this point, so that's why they haven't been provided to the House.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8546937" data-originallang="en">I want to go back to my point and say that if we know and have been told that something does not exist, what's the point of asking for it? Are we trying to make a political statement, or are we trying to fix an issue we have identified here? What would be the purpose of getting these records? I'm still trying to figure this out.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8546938" data-originallang="en"> We've had a lot of meetings on this. To Mr. Desjarlais's point, he wants to get back to our study. Well, what's the purpose of this study at this point? We have brought so many broad-ranging issues into this that I think it's not just me but a lot of members on this committee who have lost focus of why we're doing what we're doing here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8546939" data-originallang="en"> The original point, I will reiterate, is for us to make sure that taxpayer dollars are being used effectively and efficiently for Canadians. If that's not happening, how do we make sure it happens?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8546940" data-originallang="en"> We're looking at SDTC to figure out what has happened. We know that as soon as the <a data-HoCid="271243" href="/politicians/francois-philippe-champagne/" title="FranÃ§ois-Philippe Champagne">minister</a> realized there was wrongdoing, he took action right away. We are continuing down this path to ensure that this doesn't happen again.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8546941" data-originallang="en">In fact, I'm looking forward to debating Mr. Perkins' motion on the next steps, which we'll hopefully do before time runs out in this committee. There's the production of documents that are already available in the House to all members. They will be, Mr. Perkins. Knowing that those documents don't exist, asking for further documents with informal meeting minutes, which we know don't exist and the PCO officials have confirmed don't exist.... I'm really not sure how that helps us further this study at all.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8546942" data-originallang="en">I hope members will support my amendment to strike what is blatantly obvious and what we've already been told by PCO officials. These transient minutes, scribbles on a notebook or whatever they may be, do not exist, so why are we asking for them, other than...? I don't know what kind of political advantage anybody would be able to gain from them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8546943" data-originallang="en">Again, I would encourage members to say, look, let's be efficient. Let's focus on what is important here. Let's ensure that we're trying to find positive solutions to what needs to be done, which is making sure that public dollars are used efficiently and effectively, and where there are issues, challenges or wrongdoing, they are corrected immediately and efficiently.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8546944" data-originallang="en">Is this going to get us to do that? No. Therefore, to my point, I would again tell members this amendment is necessary for efficiency, to make sure that we're not going down rabbit holes that take us away from the main focus of this study, which is improving efficiency and transparency within the SDTC and within government institutions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8546945" data-originallang="en">I will park my comments there.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8546946" data-originallang="en">I'm not sure who is speaking next.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8546947" data-originallang="en">Thanks, Chair.</p>
