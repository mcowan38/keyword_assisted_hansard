<p data-HoCid="8760349" data-originallang="en"> Perhaps the parliamentary secretary could elaborate on why now is the right time to be moving this motion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8760350" data-originallang="en"> I believe we have looked at the Gaza humanitarian program. I'm unsure whether the department has actually responded to all the questions that came out of those discussions we had at the table about the Gaza humanitarian program and the Sudan program.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8760351" data-originallang="en">I note that the Sudan program is not in this motion, and I think that Sudan is an equally terrible situation on the ground. Many of us have Canadians of Sudanese heritage from the region who have family members who are finding it quite difficult to obtain a response from IRCC and obtain a visa and are also finding it quite difficult to even leave the region or have certainty they'll be allowed somehow to get here. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8760352" data-originallang="en">The situation in Sudan has become substantially worse with the ongoing civil war, and millions of people have now fled to the surrounding countries. The last time I checked, there were about half a million refugees in Egypt alone.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8760353" data-originallang="en">I'm wondering if the parliamentary secretary knows the answers to those questions on why Sudan wasn't included in this motion and whether IRCC has actually followed up with all the questions that came out of the last two meetings we had on this particular program. We are looking at the spending that the department is doing and the supplementary estimates (B). I note that none of those programs are in there. There are no extra monies being assigned to any of them. Perhaps the parliamentary secretary has an answer to that.</p>
