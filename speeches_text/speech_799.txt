<p data-HoCid="6578605" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6578606" data-originallang="en">Good afternoon, colleagues.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6578607" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Minister, again for your regular availability to this committee. We really appreciate it. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6578608" data-originallang="en">Minister, I want to say it's refreshing to work with somebody like you who is so passionate about her portfolio. It was a pleasure to work with you on the Accessible Canada Act, Bill <a data-HoCid="9990870" href="/bills/42-1/C-81/" title="An Act to ensure a barrier-free Canada">C-81</a>, in the last Parliament. I know it's transformational legislation. Again, thank you for your commitment.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6578609" data-originallang="en">Minister, I do want [<em>Technical difficultyâ€”Editor</em>] to talk about CERB. I know MP Gazan talked about CERB with respect to poverty, and I think we all know that without CERB hundreds of thousands of Canadians would have fallen into poverty. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6578610" data-originallang="en">Minister, my question is this. When the Canadian economy shut down due to the pandemic, it was evident that the employment insurance system would not be able to handle the volume of claimants who would be applying. I think all of us MPs could certainly attest to that, given the calls we were getting into our offices as our government launched the Canada emergency response benefit, the CERB, to support Canadians who were unable to work. This benefit ended up providing direct financial support to more than eight million Canadians, ensuring they had the help they needed to pay their bills and support their families. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6578611" data-originallang="en">I will be blunt. It was shocking to me to hear, especially from Conservative members, comments about the CERB being too generous. What would have happened if our government had not taken action to create the CERB?</p>
<p data-HoCid="6578612" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Minister.</p>
