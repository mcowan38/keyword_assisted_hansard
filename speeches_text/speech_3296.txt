<p data-HoCid="8126664" data-originallang="en">As Sonia indicated, if you're continuing to look on page 2, clause 2, G-3, it will appear that clause 2 impacts proposed subsection 810.03(5), “Timeliness”. G-3 impacts that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8126665" data-originallang="en">G-3 impacts “Conditions in recognizance” on page 3. It impacts the beginning, as well as proposed paragraph 810.03(7)(e) under that one. Then, if you're looking, G-3 has impacts on page 4 under “Submissions from the informant”, “Surrender”, “Reasons”, “Variance of conditions”, “Safety and security of informant”, and “Form”. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8126666" data-originallang="en">G-3 actually is throughout. It has implications on three different pages of this bill. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8126667" data-originallang="en">We'll start with Gazan, followed by Ferreri, followed by.... Oh, Michelle was still speaking.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8126668" data-originallang="en">Michelle, you still have the floor, and then I'll go on to the others. </p>
