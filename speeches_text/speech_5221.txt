<p data-HoCid="8679173" data-originallang="en">What I meant and said was that, following the tragedy of the massacre of October 7 and, frankly, what's happened in Gaza and the West Bank since, you can't expect people to be thinking about two states. The Germans and Brits, following the Second World War, could not have imagined they would eventually be in the EU together or major allies. The Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland, who killed each other for 400 years, couldn't have imagined they would agree to a peace deal. Israelis and Palestinians will never get over their tragedies, but they must realize that, for their own peace and security, they have to come together. There are 7.5 million Jews and 7.5 million Arabs sharing this land, and neither group is going away. None of them is going away. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679174" data-originallang="en">What I'm saying is that, beginning now but over time, good people in both countries will realize that continuing the violence—sending their soldiers to war and death—is not the answer. That will come, but it will take time, especially because of October 7 and what's happened since. </p>
