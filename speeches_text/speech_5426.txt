<p data-HoCid="8703157" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703158" data-originallang="en">Welcome to all the witnesses this morning. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8703159" data-originallang="en">Peace in the Middle East means peace to the world. This has had a long history. We all hope that Canada remains in place as one of the main players to promote peace and security in many places in the world, and specifically in the Middle East. It's difficult to hear Canada being blamed for being on the shortfall of providing any support. Canada put in a lot of resources to support the Palestinian Authority after the Oslo negotiation. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8703160" data-originallang="en">The question is this: What are the conditions necessary for long-standing peace with the region? I'll give the opportunity to all three of you to answer. I'll start with Mr. Balsam and then go to Mr. Awad and Mr. Bueckert. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8703161" data-originallang="en">Please go ahead. </p>
