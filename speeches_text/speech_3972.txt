<p data-HoCid="8324977" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I am wondering if the member could provide his thoughts on the G7 leaders' statement on Iran's attack against Israel:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8324978" data-originallang="en"> We, the Leaders of the G7, unequivocally condemn in the strongest terms Iran's direct and unprecedented attack against Israel. Iran fired hundreds of drones and missiles towards Israel. Israel, with the help of its partners, defeated the attack. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8324979" data-originallang="en"> We express our full solidarity and support to Israel and its people and reaffirm our commitment towards its security. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8324980" data-originallang="en"> With its actions, Iran has further stepped toward the destabilization of the region and risks provoking an uncontrollable regional escalation. This must be avoided. We will continue to work to stabilize the situation and avoid further escalation. In this spirit, we demand that Iran and its proxies cease their attacks, and we stand ready to take further measures now and in response to further destabilizing initiatives. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8324981" data-originallang="en"> We will also strengthen our cooperation to end the crisis in Gaza, including by continuing to work towards an immediate and sustainable ceasefire and the release of hostages by Hamas, and deliver increased humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in need. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8324982" data-originallang="en">Does the member support what the G7 leaders have said?</p>
