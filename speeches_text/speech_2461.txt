<p data-HoCid="7927945" data-originallang="fr">I acknowledge the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons and all those who were the victims of Naziism during the Second World War. As long as any of the perpetrators are still alive, there are still victims, and our thoughts are with them. We need to show all those who have been affected in any way that this House and this government do not take lightly what happened on Friday. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7927946" data-originallang="fr">What will the government do to correct this terrible mistake?</p>
