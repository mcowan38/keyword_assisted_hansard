<p data-HoCid="6300278" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, I rise to honour the remarkable life of Fania “Fanny” Goose, a constituent and long-time business leader in London who passed away in her 99th year this April. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6300279" data-originallang="en">Fanny, or the first lady of downtown, as she was also known, was a remarkable woman who experienced the best and worst our world can offer. A Holocaust survivor who came to Canada in 1949, Fanny and her husband realized the Canadian dream by founding a retail business that became a pillar of London's downtown for over 50 years.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6300280" data-originallang="en">Fanny was sought out for her direct and savvy advice. Always politically engaged, she had her finger on the pulse of the community. Fanny was kind, confident and thoughtful, and always had a positive outlook. Predeceased by her husband Jerry, she was mother to Steve Goose Garrison and Martin Goose, and loving bubbie to three grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6300281" data-originallang="en">May Fanny rest in eternal peace. Her legacy will live on for generations to come.</p>
