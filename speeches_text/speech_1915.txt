<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">I would like to provide a short update regarding a statement I made on May 11, 2022, concerning similarities between two bills that were before the House at that time. They were Bill <a data-HoCid="11535416" href="/bills/44-1/C-250/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (prohibition — promotion of antisemitism)">C-250</a>, an act to amend the Criminal Code (prohibition—promotion of antisemitism), standing in the name of the member for <a data-HoCid="278477" href="/politicians/kevin-waugh/" title="Kevin Waugh">Saskatoon—Grasswood</a>, and Bill <a data-HoCid="11719486" href="/bills/44-1/C-19/" title="An Act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on April 7, 2022 and other measures">C-19</a>, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on April 7, 2022, and other measures.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">As members will recall, clause 332 of Bill <a data-HoCid="11719486" href="/bills/44-1/C-19/" title="An Act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on April 7, 2022 and other measures">C-19</a> contained near identical text to Bill <a data-HoCid="11535416" href="/bills/44-1/C-250/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (prohibition — promotion of antisemitism)">C-250</a>. To be more specific, the two bills sought to amend section 319 of the Criminal Code pertaining to hate propaganda, for similar purposes. Both made it an offence to wilfully promote antisemitism by condoning, denying or downplaying the Holocaust through statements communicated other than in private conversation. There was only a minor difference in the wording of one of the acceptable defences.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">As indicated in my earlier statement on this matter, there is a long-standing principle to keep or avoid having the same question from being decided twice within the same session. On May 11, 2022, the Chair had therefore ordered that, pending the fate of Bill <a data-HoCid="11719486" href="/bills/44-1/C-19/" title="An Act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on April 7, 2022 and other measures">C-19</a>, Bill <a data-HoCid="11535416" href="/bills/44-1/C-250/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (prohibition — promotion of antisemitism)">C-250</a> may not be called for its second hour of debate at second reading.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Bill <a data-HoCid="11719486" href="/bills/44-1/C-19/" title="An Act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on April 7, 2022 and other measures">C-19</a> received royal assent on June 23, 2022. Accordingly, I am ordering that the order for the second reading of Bill <a data-HoCid="11535416" href="/bills/44-1/C-250/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (prohibition — promotion of antisemitism)">C-250</a> be discharged and that the bill be dropped from the Order Paper.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">I thank all the members for their attention.</p>
