<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">Madam Chair, I thank the minister for her answer. Once again, I reiterate my appeal for the specific cases of Taiwan, Palestine and Haiti, and I hope the minister will be receptive to my appeal.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">Now I want to talk about the $69 million or so earmarked for the Rohingya crisis. Obviously, no one could be against virtue and apple pie. We see this as a very necessary investment, given the serious situation facing the Rohingya population in Myanmar.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">This government has even stated that no population, group or community should be persecuted because of its identity.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">With that in mind, can the minister talk to us about the situation of the people who are currently being subjected to a veritable genocide in Tigray, while Ethiopia is the main recipient of Canada's international aid, and could she also talk about Palestine?</p>
