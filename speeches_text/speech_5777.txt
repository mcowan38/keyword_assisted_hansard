<p data-HoCid="8771271" data-originallang="en">I was researching some procurement initiatives this morning. What is funny is that the first thing that popped up was an ad that said, “Discover the cure for Bad Service Management”. That led me down a bit of a rabbit hole. It got me thinking about the procurement times we have for some of our equipment for military use. It takes over seven years to buy tow trucks. That one caught my interest. It takes over 10 years to buy drones. Meanwhile, we've seen rising threats from China and Russia, which would suggest that the timelines for military procurement should be compressed to weigh against the threats. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8771272" data-originallang="en">I understand that in procurement there's an element of risk management, whether it's financial risk management or equipment risk management, but at the moment, the risks seem to be tilted towards the soldiers, air force members and sailors, because they're not getting the equipment they need in a timely manner. Can you explain to me how we can improve our procurement system such that our CAF members can get the equipment their lives depend on in a more timely manner?</p>
