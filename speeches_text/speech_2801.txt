<p data-HoCid="7988412" data-originallang="en">We have indicated that the Government of Israel needs to abide by the rules of war and international law. Those are questions that need to be responded to. There are questions around military strategy that the Government of Israel will take on itself but that we're certain will be closely watched from outside.</p>
