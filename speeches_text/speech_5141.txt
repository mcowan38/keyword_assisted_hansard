<p data-HoCid="8679326" data-originallang="en"> It has long been Canada's policy to support a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The most practical means that Canada has of bringing this about, especially at this pivotal time, is to immediately recognize the state of Palestine.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679327" data-originallang="en">Among many reasons for that, there are three to my mind.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679328" data-originallang="en">First, immediate recognition of Palestine would serve as a holding operation against the clear Israeli rejection of the two-state solution. On July 18, 2024, the Israeli parliament passed a resolution formally rejecting the establishment of a Palestinian state in the occupied Palestinian territory. This position has been held by Israel for years, as stated publicly at the highest governmental levels. The governing Likud party platform openly rejects the establishment of a Palestine state.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679329" data-originallang="en">Likewise, the so-called guiding principles of the present government of the State of Israel state that “The Jewish people have an exclusive and indisputable right to all [parts] of the Land of Israel”, which is a term that includes the occupied Palestinian territory, and that “The government will promote and develop settlement” in that territory to that end.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679330" data-originallang="en">In order to apply what it calls its sovereignty in the occupied Palestinian territory, Israel has appointed a special minister, Mr. Bezalel Smotrich, who asserted on May 18, 2023, that the “core mission” of the Israeli government is to increase the number of settlements in the West Bank by 500,000 within two years.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679331" data-originallang="en">I note that all of this happened before October 7, 2023.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679332" data-originallang="en">Second, immediate recognition of Palestine would be in keeping with Canada's international legal obligation to see to it that the Palestinian people's long-frustrated right to self-determination is realized.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679333" data-originallang="en">On July 19 this year, this obligation was affirmed by the International Court of Justice when it determined that Israel's continued presence in the occupied Palestinian territory is unlawful, in part because it violates the Palestinian people's right to self-determination. The ICJ reiterated that “all States”—which, of course, include Canada—must “ensure that any impediment resulting from the illegal presence of Israel in the [OPT] to the exercise of the Palestinian [people's] right to self-determination is brought to an end.” Recognition is an obvious means by which Canada can discharge this international legal obligation it holds.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679334" data-originallang="en">There is an unfortunate view in the Canadian political realm that the only way for a Palestinian state to emerge is through bilateral negotiations, but this is legally mistaken. Israel's presence in the territory is an internationally wrongful act, and the end of that act cannot be made subject to negotiation under international law. It must be withdrawn—the occupation—forthwith, immediately and unconditionally.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679335" data-originallang="en">Third, immediate recognition of Palestine would be in keeping with the fact that the state of Palestine already juridically exists under international law. Palestine meets all four criteria of the existence of a state under international law, which have historically been given a very liberal, flexible and permissive interpretation under state practice.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679336" data-originallang="en">Number one is that Palestine possesses a permanent population of over five million people, 2.3 million of whom in the Gaza Strip are now at threat of being ethnically cleansed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679337" data-originallang="en">Number two is that Palestine possesses a defined territory: the occupied Palestinian territory.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679338" data-originallang="en">Number three is that Palestine possesses governmental functions sufficient for the functioning of a state, as affirmed by the UN General Assembly, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the ad hoc liaison committee, etc.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679339" data-originallang="en">Number four is that Palestine has established a capacity to conduct foreign relations, as demonstrated by the fact that it has been granted non-member observer-state status by the UN General Assembly and has a total of 149 other states that recognize it, representing the vast majority of people and states on planet Earth. This includes friends and allies of Canada, such as Ireland, Norway, Spain, Sweden and so on.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679340" data-originallang="en">I close with this: Canada has officially supported a two-state solution in Israel-Palestine since 1949. Since that year, Canada has recognized only one half of that solution: Israel. At a time when Israel is openly and publicly pursuing a policy aimed at obliterating the two-state solution, Canada must do what it can to stop this from happening. Immediately recognizing the state of Palestine is the least that Canada can do, both in accordance with its obligations under international law, as well as in order to save any prospect of peace in line with the two-state policy in the future. Canada must act now before it is too late.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679341" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much. I'm happy to take questions.</p>
