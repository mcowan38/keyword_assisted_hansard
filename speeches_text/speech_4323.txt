<p data-HoCid="8417137" data-originallang="fr">Madam Chair, it is indeed Bill <a data-HoCid="12734364" href="/bills/44-1/C-367/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (promotion of hatred or antisemitism)">C‑367</a>, which was introduced by the member for <a data-HoCid="278267" href="/politicians/yves-francois-blanchet/" title="Yves-François Blanchet">Beloeil—Chambly</a> and leader of the Bloc Québécois, that simply seeks to eliminate this religious exemption. I hope that the government and the minister will be in favour of this bill.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8417138" data-originallang="fr">I will ask a simple question to close: Will the minister finally implement an organized crime registry? </p>
