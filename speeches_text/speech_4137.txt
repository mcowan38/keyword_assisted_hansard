<p data-HoCid="8406225" data-originallang="en"> I want to talk about a protest that took place at McGill University at the end of March, where a crowd of protesters—as they do at all protests—was chanting “Viva, viva, intifada”. I asked a senior administrator at McGill if saying that “We should kill all [insert name of group here] people”, would that violate the McGill code of conduct? They said yes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8406226" data-originallang="en"> I asked why calling for intifada did not violate the McGill code of conduct. They said because calling for the genocide of a group of people explicitly violated the law. Therefore, it violated the code of conduct, but where the law fails to protect us as Jewish students, our universities provide no extra protection.</p>
