<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">Madam Chair, I am proud that Canada is one of Israel's biggest and strongest allies at the United Nations and in many international organizations. We also know that we are friends of the Palestinian people. </p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">I want to inform my colleague that the government's policy on the United Nations and on votes related to the Middle East is clear. We are opposed to any initiative, within the United Nations and other multilateral forums, that is specifically aimed at criticizing only Israel, since we believe in a much more holistic approach. We therefore reject any unilateral resolutions from these forums that would politicize these issues. </p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">It goes without saying that we expect the two parties to be able to work together through these admittedly difficult circumstances, to ensure lasting peace in the Middle East.</p>
