<p data-HoCid="7873834" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7873835" data-originallang="fr">We have a lot of work to do in the next hour. I hope we can get everything done.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7873836" data-originallang="fr">With regard to my colleague Ms. Gazan's motion, I would like to begin by saying that, like everyone else, I have a great deal of sympathy for the victims. It is a horrible case.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7873837" data-originallang="fr">However, it is difficult to get involved in the work of organizations that fall under provincial or municipal jurisdiction. Accountability for provincial or municipal organizations outside Ottawa's jurisdiction is a difficult area. There is also the matter of the deadline set out in the motion, which we find difficult to meet, if not completely unreasonable.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7873838" data-originallang="fr">Because of this deadline and what Ottawa can do to interfere in something that does not concern it, although I am very sensitive to this issue, I will vote against the motion.</p>
