<p data-HoCid="7067981" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, on April 12, thousands will visit the Ohel: the resting place of the Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Schneerson, for the 120th anniversary of his birth.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7067982" data-originallang="en">The Rebbe’s teaching has imparted to the Jewish people a sense of responsibility to God and to one another. He was a leader who exemplified true selflessness, and whose altruism grew in others exponentially and continues through the unparalleled success of the Chabad movement. He took a people decimated by the Holocaust and inspired them to believe in God’s providence again.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7067983" data-originallang="en">This great modern Jewish sage was born in Ukraine, which is a country that today is an example of moral clarity and strength in the world. It is a country where Chabad’s humanitarian effort is nothing short of heroic. The Rebbe would go on to engineer the global Jewish renaissance committed to caring for the spiritual needs of all Jews, wherever they could be found. He turned Judaism outward instead of inward.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7067984" data-originallang="en">Today, Jews and non-Jews around world are influenced by the Rebbe through his thousands of emissaries, through his teachings and through his actions. It is not only the Rebbe's birthday, but it is a day of virtue for Chabad in our communities and for the entire Jewish people.</p>
