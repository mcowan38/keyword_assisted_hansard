<p data-HoCid="7727678" data-originallang="en">There is nothing universal about the child care bill, and I think that is what we heard repeatedly from witnesses in their testimony. If I can go to a quote from briefs that were submitted to the committee, this is from Kathryn Babowal. She's with Les Petits Soleils Inc. She said:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7727679" data-originallang="en"> CWELCC roll out has actually resulted in inequitable access and creation of extensive waitlists for parents. Expansion freezes have been placed upon private operators, which have created a lack of access for families in private centres and waitlists in the hundreds per centre. These expansion freezes are creating a two-tiered system: increased demand for childcare due to CWELCC has forced private programs to expand to meet need, despite having no access to grants for parents, which results in parents paying upwards of $50 more per day for the same program, staff and venue. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7727680" data-originallang="en">I think it's just frustrating. Just own what it is, if I'm going to be so blunt, because we just went through and heard this from my colleague down the way, Ms. Gazan. Just own it. Either you're including everyone or you're not. I think it's unfortunate that you've pitted two systems against each other that need each other to meet the demand. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7727681" data-originallang="en">At the core of this discussion has to be the child. The nucleus of this discussion is the welfare of the child. There are countless testimonies that say there are winners and losers. I've said this repeatedly. I'm a mom. Affordable child care and quality child care is incredible, but if it's not accessible it doesn't exist. The only people who are winning—and we heard this repeatedly—are the people who already have a spot. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7727682" data-originallang="en">Therefore, either call it what it is or don't. It's not universal child care, Mr. Chair. </p>
