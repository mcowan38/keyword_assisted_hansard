<p data-HoCid="6298084" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, prior to my election I had the opportunity to work with the United Nations, prosecuting crimes against humanity and genocide at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The legal standard for establishing genocide is a high one, as it must be for the most heinous crime known to humanity.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6298085" data-originallang="en"> I am saddened to indicate that it is genocide that appears to be taking place today in China. A set of studies by the Subcommittee on International Human Rights demonstrates clearly that two million Uighur Muslims are being detained in modern-day concentration camps, unable to speak their language or practise their faith. This is the largest mass detention of a community since the Holocaust. What is more, Uighur Muslims are being subjected to horrific abuses, including forced sterilization and abortions. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6298086" data-originallang="en">The UN Genocide Convention is clear: Imposing measures intended to prevent births within a group is committing an act of genocide. This is happening in China right now under our watch. I will not stand for it, nor should any member of the House. </p>
