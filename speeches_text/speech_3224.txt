<p data-HoCid="8084188" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, we are watching with horror the tragedies of the ongoing war in the Middle East. Many Yukoners have expressed to me how helpless they feel in such a dire situation, and everyone wants the daily violence to stop. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8084189" data-originallang="en">With this sentiment and in the spirit of peace, leaders of our territory's Muslim, Jewish and Christian communities took action. In true Yukon fashion, compassionate and kind, they organized a fundraiser for Gaza, which was held at the local United Church. Hundreds turned up. Yukoners of many faiths, ethnicities and backgrounds gathered to share food, to talk and to listen to local musician Andrea McColeman. Over $13,000 was raised and donated to humanitarian relief efforts in Gaza. In the words of one of the organizers, “The warmth of Whitehorse was on display in its full splendor on that frigid day.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8084190" data-originallang="en">I am so very proud of the organizers' efforts and thank every Yukoner who attended and showed their support. In this terrible time of violence, it was a beautiful reminder that unity is our greatest tool for peace.</p>
