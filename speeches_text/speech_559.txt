<p data-HoCid="6474032" data-originallang="fr">Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his speech and his comments.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6474033" data-originallang="fr">I lived in the Eastern Townships for a number of years, so I am quite familiar with his area, Drummondville. It is a wonderful city that, as he said, has an extremely vibrant arts and culture scene. As we know, those who work in arts and culture often have trouble making ends meet and sometimes face certain obstacles.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6474034" data-originallang="fr">My question is quite simple. Does he agree with the idea of a guaranteed basic income, as proposed by the member for <a data-HoCid="253019" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>? Does he believe that having a guaranteed basic income would improve the situation for those living in the regions? In Drummondville, the cultural community is extremely vibrant, but artists sometimes have a hard time making ends meet.</p>
