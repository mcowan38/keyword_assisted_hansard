<p data-HoCid="8783169" data-originallang="en"> Minister, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for both the Prime Minister of Israel and the former defence minister for crimes against humanity and crimes committed since the Israel-Hamas war began more than a year ago. Both the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> and the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="MÃ©lanie Joly">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> have said that they would abide by that ruling. You acknowledge that we are a signatory to the Rome Statute. You have been wavering in clearly committing an answer towards whether these illegal Israeli settlements constitute war crimes, and you're being equally evasive in stating, as the Minister of Justice, what Canada would do should both of these individuals set foot on Canadian soil. I think Canadians would like a clear answer from their Minister of Justice on this.</p>
