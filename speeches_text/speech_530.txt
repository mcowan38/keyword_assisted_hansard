<p data-HoCid="6420463" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, during the pandemic we have seen a rise in the number of hate-filled incidents where people have been harassed simply because of their race or religion. This is completely unacceptable and needs to stop. While some people view these incidents in isolation, we know that they have a broader impact on our wider community. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6420464" data-originallang="en">I am proud as the newly elected parliamentarian representing the very diverse riding of York Centre. It is home to synagogues, mosques and Black churches, all of which are too often targets of anti-Semitic, Islamophobic or anti-Black hate-motivated crimes. I always like to ensure that all of my constituents can live, worship and pray openly, peacefully and without fear for their safety.</p>
