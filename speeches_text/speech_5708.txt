<p data-HoCid="8784180" data-originallang="en"> I assume you've been following some of the discussions around the legislation, which perhaps was inspired by the bubble legislation during the pandemic, with regard to health care spaces to allow health care workers to come and go freely from their places of work. This idea of bubble legislation has come up regarding community spaces as well, whether they be mosques or synagogues, in terms of trying to prevent what we saw, for example, in my neighbourhood around the Shaar the other night and the kind of protest that was there.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8784181" data-originallang="en"> Does B'nai Brith have thoughts on that type of legislation, whether that would be effective, or potentially, on the pitfalls there with the tension around freedom of expression as well?</p>
