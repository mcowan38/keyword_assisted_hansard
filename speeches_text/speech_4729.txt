<p data-HoCid="8539253" data-originallang="en">Chair, your hint is well taken. Thank you very much. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8539254" data-originallang="en">I was looking forward to my speaking slot in this meeting, but here we are speaking to this motion. I would like to refer to the talk of a narrative, that it's a Liberal narrative and a government narrative and so on. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8539255" data-originallang="en">I'm wondering if the witness is aware.... She is an experienced civil servant. I was going to ask her how she felt about her testimony, which is heartfelt and has been very detailed, and of which I still have questions regarding some of the responses, dates and conversations that don't seem to line up. I was looking for clarity on those responses, yet I wonder how the witness feels about her testimony being used to basically be a Twitter feed for members of the official opposition. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8539256" data-originallang="en">I say that if that's the case, and if the witness's name is dragged into that kind of partisan narrative, I would deeply regret it if that were to happen. I think the witness, as an experienced civil servant, can see what has been going on here today. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8539257" data-originallang="en">That being said, regarding this motion, it is one that I also have difficulty understanding, because the public accounts committee is not an investigative body. We're certainly not an investigative body doing deep dives into wrongdoing. That is the work of the Auditor General. We review the reports of the Auditor General, and then we go into detail about those reports, which is what we have been doing here, even though at many times, actually, it's quite redundant in the testimony that we hear and the hearings that have been called for. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8539258" data-originallang="en">This topic, and what we have heard today from the witness, is already part of an internal investigation. I would be very reluctant, and I wonder if the witness feels the same way, for us to interfere with that investigation. I don't know how it would be helpful. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8539259" data-originallang="en">As for Kristian Firth, who has not appeared before this committee, though we've seen much of his testimony both in OGGO and in the House, I'm not sure what else we can get from him. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8539260" data-originallang="en">It's very weird that we are here today and it's very bizarre to be going down this rabbit hole and subjecting, quite honestly, the witness, who has been forthright, to being accused of not being forthcoming in her testimony here today. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8539261" data-originallang="en">That's all I have to say. Thank you.</p>
