<p data-HoCid="7957920" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I too want to thank my colleague for her nuanced speech, nuance that is sorely lacking when we look at the state of public discourse on this unspeakable strategy that has unfolded in the Middle East since October 7. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7957921" data-originallang="fr">I just want to make a few comments before asking my question. I think that my colleague is exactly right when she says that we must eliminate Hamas, of which far too many Israelis and Palestinians are victims. They have been stuck with this terrorist group for 17 years now without any opportunity to make a choice. The Palestinians are paying the price for this terrorist group, Hamas. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7957922" data-originallang="fr">I also believe that she is exactly right when she says, in her response, that Israel has a heavy responsibility with respect to the methods it resorts to and that it must also respect international humanitarian law. We see that with 3,000 victims in Gaza and more than 1,000 Israeli victims: Violence breeds violence. I think we need to be careful to ensure that the actions that are taken do not further widen the gap that has been widening for decades.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957923" data-originallang="fr">I have a question for her. I will echo what Jean‑François Lépine said on the show <em>Tout le monde en parle</em> on Sunday evening. He said that if there is one thing that has come out of what is happening in Israel and Gaza, it is that the status quo cannot work. There needs to be a two-state solution, two viable states.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957924" data-originallang="fr">Does my colleague agree with that statement?</p>
