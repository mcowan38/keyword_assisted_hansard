<p data-HoCid="8098641" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much for the question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098642" data-originallang="en">Indeed, Canada played an absolutely indispensable role in creating the International Criminal Court. The recent deputy prosecutor of the ICC, James Stewart, is also a Canadian.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098643" data-originallang="en">When I spoke of this idea of creating an international justice ambassador, it's because we have such a great wealth of international lawyers and people who are committed to the prosecution of international crimes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098644" data-originallang="en">In response to your question, I think the most appropriate body to currently investigate and prosecute international crimes in the Middle East conflict is the International Criminal Court. However, if Canada does not believe that is possible, that should not be the end of the story. It can't be that just because the ICC can't investigate, then there should be impunity for war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098645" data-originallang="en">There are potentially other options. In my recommendations, which I'd be happy to share in written or expanded form if they would be useful to the committee, I noted that it could be possible to create an additional tribunal, a hybrid court, which mixes international staff and staff from Palestine and Israel. It would be difficult, but it's worthwhile exploring, to investigate and prosecute additional international crimes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098646" data-originallang="en">One thing that is critically important to remember is that the ICC, in the best of circumstances—and it never gets the best of circumstances—can investigate and prosecute maybe five, six or seven people. There are more than that who are responsible for international crimes in this conflict. An additional comprehensive justice and accountability effort would be worth exploring.</p>
