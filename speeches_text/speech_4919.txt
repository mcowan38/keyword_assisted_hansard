<p data-HoCid="8576785" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I am sorry that I am going to ask this question in English, because I do not have enough control of my French to be able to speak to the complexity of this issue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576786" data-originallang="en">The member spoke about the horror. He painted a picture of the horror that Israelis felt on October 7, and I think everyone in this House felt that horror. I am a mother. My children are the same age as those children would have been who had gone to that music festival. We were all horrified by that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576787" data-originallang="en">However, from my perspective, when he does not recognize that there are at least 40,000 Palestinians who have also been killed and have also lost their lives, what he is doing is dehumanizing Palestinians and dehumanizing others, and that is terrible.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576788" data-originallang="en">They keep talking about not giving weapons to Israel. Does the member understand the way the arms trade treaty and Canadian law work? Canadian law says that we are not able to send weapons to any country that may be perpetrating a genocide. The International Court of Justice has said there is a plausible case that genocide is being perpetrated, so it is against the law for Canada to send weapons right now to Israel. It is against the Canadian law. He should know that.</p>
