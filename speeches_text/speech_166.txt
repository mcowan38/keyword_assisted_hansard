<p data-HoCid="6171017" data-originallang="en">In the technology that we've developed, and I'm going back to that metaphor of smoke detector and fire extinguisher, we've really been focusing much more on developing the early warning systems that could give us a signal that there is a threat coming.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6171018" data-originallang="en">COVID-19 is here now and we're all very well aware of it and we're now sort of more in firefighting mode, grabbing the fire extinguisher to put fires out.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6171019" data-originallang="en">From the standpoint of our technology, the area where we are supporting public health decisions is around an understanding of population movements and how that relates to the transmission of COVID-19 across the country. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6171020" data-originallang="en">With respect to the next set of waves, I have two thoughts. One is clearly the vast majority of the population in Canada remains susceptible, as we've heard. We either could see an uptick in cases later in the fall because of a variety of factors including climate conditions and dynamics of how people are interacting, or we could find ourselves in a similar position to some countries like Australia and New Zealand, where imported cases become the catalyst for another wave.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6171021" data-originallang="en">So we're going to have to be thinking both internally and externally. These are a couple of examples of how our technology is looking internally within the country domestically as well as globally.</p>
