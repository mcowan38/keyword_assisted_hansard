<p data-HoCid="8303239" data-originallang="en">Okay. I will try to be judicious with my time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303240" data-originallang="en">I think the question is about who should get recognized in Parliament and who should not. You can invite all types of people. I think the second part of the issue that this committee has been tasked with is to figure out how we go about fixing the reputation of Canada—fixing the reputation that we damaged. As a group, as a collective, because of the actions of the Speaker and the lack of action by the Office of the Prime Minister, we damaged President Zelenskyy's reputation. We allowed it to then be used by Russian propaganda to go after him.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303241" data-originallang="en">We've talked about sources. The Polish Institute of National Remembrance—Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation found that in the village of Huta Pieniacka, a massacre was indeed committed. The 14th was involved. Ethnic cleansing was done against 100,000 Polish people. That is why the Polish community is so sensitive about this. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8303242" data-originallang="en">The national commission was found to have had the right facts. The findings were confirmed by the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine in 2005. We can talk about Wikipedia. That's one thing. We can Google things. These are national commissions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303243" data-originallang="en">What we do here in Canada, in our sources, it's our particular context. We should look to the two nations closest to a country that they are now fighting—directly, in the case of Ukraine, and indirectly, in the case of Poland—to ensure that both remain free. As I've said before, you cannot have a free Ukraine without a free Poland. You cannot have a free Poland without a free Ukraine. You will never have a home safe enough for the Jewish people in that region without both of those countries being free, where you are free to be a Jew who speaks Hebrew or Yiddish—including Yiddish proverbs, which I loved very much from my grandmother.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303244" data-originallang="en">How do we move beyond this to fix the reputation of Canada and our Parliament so that we can be of benefit to our ally in Ukraine? I've asked that question of others as well. What are the specific actions we can take to fix the Prime Minister's Office's mistake and the Speaker's mistake for reconciliation?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303245" data-originallang="en">Perhaps you can keep it short, because I have one more thing to ask. I'll cut you off in a minute and a half.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303246" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Marceau, if you want to answer first, go ahead.</p>
