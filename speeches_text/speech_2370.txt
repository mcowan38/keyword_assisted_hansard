<p data-HoCid="7732856" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Chair, I want to thank my colleague for her inspired and heartfelt speech. I want to acknowledge the importance of the 11 first nations in Quebec. They have a long history and strong roots in many areas, particularly in the member's region, but also in Montreal, where they face many difficulties and challenges.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7732857" data-originallang="fr">Several years ago, as a result of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, recommendations were made and money was allocated in the budget. My colleague from <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> pointed out earlier that after all these years, the federal government has spent only 5% of this money, despite the fact that there are urgent and pressing needs, such as shelters or transition houses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7732858" data-originallang="fr">How does my colleague interpret the fact that the Liberal government has been dragging its feet for years on such a critical issue?</p>
