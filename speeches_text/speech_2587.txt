<p data-HoCid="7957461" data-originallang="en">He spoke about the need to eliminate Hamas. The children who are being bombed in Gaza today are not Hamas. The children who are dying every 16 minutes, right now, in Palestine are not Hamas.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957462" data-originallang="en">Would the member agree that collective punishment is against international law, and that that is what is happening right now in Gaza?</p>
