<p data-HoCid="7105527" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I certainly want to thank the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278383" href="/politicians/anthony-housefather/" title="Anthony Housefather">Mount Royal</a>. He has been a stellar performer on the heritage committee that I serve on. I know, when I put it on the Order Paper, that the hon. member for Mount Royal phoned me right away: It was seconds after it was on the Order Paper.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7105528" data-originallang="en">I agree that this needs to change, whether I pursue this as a private member's bill, Bill <a data-HoCid="11535416" href="/bills/44-1/C-250/">C-250</a>, or whether the government picks it up and hopefully moves it forward, if it is going to do anything with this bill. Unfortunately, in the last Parliament, the Liberals took my bill but kind of lagged with it, so I had to pick it up and move it forward, which is good. The country has benefited from it. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7105529" data-originallang="en">I agree with the hon. member that this is a good bill that is needed, particularly at this time. Anti-Semitism is on the rise in this country, and it is good that we are bringing out this bill in 2022.</p>
