<p data-HoCid="7125392" data-originallang="fr">We're really in the heat of a discussion. I totally agree with what you're saying. I just feel like at some point, maybe some groups will come forward and say that a certain symbol is particularly grave to them and it should be banned. I feel like we're going to end up in a never-ending debate over what's acceptable and what's not.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125393" data-originallang="fr">I also have another concern. These days, with debate being polarized, groups tend to be a little more open to certain ideas. We're also seeing associations forming.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125394" data-originallang="fr">I had a discussion earlier with a colleague about an upcoming appearance by a radical—let's call him Mr. Sky—who is known for his antisemitic rhetoric, promoting antisemitism, and denying the Holocaust, among other things. He will be coming as part of a protest against health restrictions. However, the people he's going to meet and talk to are likely at risk of being somewhat influenced by ideas other than the views he puts forward about health restrictions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125395" data-originallang="fr">Don't you feel that some of these polemicists might be portraying themselves as victims of free speech, and might even brandish the symbols we want to ban on purpose?</p>
