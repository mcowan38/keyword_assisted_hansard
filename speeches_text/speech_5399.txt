<p data-HoCid="8703314" data-originallang="en">Who speaks for Palestine? The Palestinian people, who are educated. There is a Palestine National Council today. Give us a space to breathe, and you will see wonders from the Palestinian people. Go to every university. You'll see university professors who are willing to sit down and formulate a whole system. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8703315" data-originallang="en">However, when you are living under occupation, it's as though you are tied down and literally cannot go from Kanata to downtown Ottawa without passing a checkpoint. Do you expect me to tell you who represents the Palestinian people? The PLO is established and is there. The Palestine National Council is there. The Palestinian Legislative Council exists. It needs reform, yesâ€”we all agree on that.</p>
