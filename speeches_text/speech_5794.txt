<p data-HoCid="8767181" data-originallang="fr">Madam Speaker, I am rising this morning in place of my extraordinary colleague, the member for <a data-HoCid="278679" href="/politicians/stephane-bergeron/" title="Stéphane Bergeron">Montarville</a>. I would like to take a moment to recognize our fantastic critic for foreign affairs, who also serves as vice-chair of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development. I am speaking here today because my colleague was kind enough to share his speaking time with me, as well as invite me to ask witnesses questions at certain committee meetings when it was conducting the study that led to the report we are debating today. I want to thank him. It gave me a lot to think about.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8767182" data-originallang="fr">Most of my speech today is based on the Bloc Québécois's supplementary opinion on the House of Commons Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development's study on sexual and reproductive rights around the world. </p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8767183" data-originallang="fr"> This long-awaited study has highlighted the very important work that remains to be done if Canada is to move from words to deeds when it comes to its feminist foreign policy. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8767184" data-originallang="fr">As the expression goes, it is important to walk the talk. While this long-awaited study was being conducted, there was a great deal of obstruction. My colleague from Montarville had told me about it, and when I took part in the meetings, I saw for myself that the Conservatives were filibustering.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8767185" data-originallang="fr">That being said, I will begin by quoting what some of the witnesses said about the accountability of this government with respect to feminist policy. I will talk more specifically about certain parts of the world. Then, I would like to talk about secularism, which is a very important value in Quebec. </p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8767186" data-originallang="fr"> Firstly, it was surprising to hear from witnesses that almost 7 years after its announcement, Canada's feminist foreign policy is still not defined through a document that details principles, objectives and implementation guidelines. This may potentially explain why sharing results in this area seems difficult for Global Affairs Canada. So, on the one hand, we have GAC announcing during the study that “Canada is making significant progress in meeting its existing commitments”. On the other hand, we have the Auditor General's assertion that Canada's feminist international aid policy includes commitments describing how the funds are to be spent, “...but had no goals related to specific improvements in the circumstances of those who benefit from the funding”. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8767187" data-originallang="fr">I actually had a conversation with my colleague from <a data-HoCid="278655" href="/politicians/nathalie-sinclair-desgagne/" title="Nathalie Sinclair-Desgagné">Terrebonne</a> about this Auditor General report.</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8767188" data-originallang="fr"> So there's a lot to think about when it comes to the development of international feminist policy by Global Affairs, from objectives to results, and how Quebec and Canadian taxpayers' money is actually being used to advance women's rights and gender equality around the world. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8767189" data-originallang="fr">Indeed, there was a lot to think about. Now I would like to get into a little more detail about specific problems in certain parts of the world, starting with Africa.</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8767190" data-originallang="fr"> Secondly, Africa is an area where the issue of sexual rights is debated, as we heard from several witnesses who discussed cultural differences, and the need for Canada to work in this part of the world. One statistic sums up the problems associated with reproductive rights: sub-Saharan Africa accounted for some 70% of maternal deaths in 2020. Canada has a duty to support countries seeking to make progress in terms of abortion rights and access to quality health care — COVID-19 having imposed, in some countries, additional difficulties in accessing health care, particularly in terms of distance. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8767191" data-originallang="fr">Keep in mind that these remarks were made in committee, particularly by Global Affairs Canada representatives, but the Auditor General also released a report on international assistance in support of gender equality. UNICEF representatives also testified in committee, and the Canadian Partnership for Women and Children's Health submitted a brief. We heard from a lot of witnesses, and all of them seemed to highlight the need to strive for greater accountability.</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8767192" data-originallang="fr"> At a time when the government is developing an “African plan”, it is vital that international development, gender equality and access to healthcare services are key pillars of this strategy. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8767193" data-originallang="fr"> Also, while some committee members denounced, during committee meetings...certain laws in certain countries that run counter to people's fundamental rights with regard to their sexuality.... Ms. Théroux-Séguin of the Centre d'étude et de coopération internationale, in her testimony, expressed the hope that Canada could support legislative measures, and promote recommendations aimed at improving sexual and reproductive health. We therefore hope that the Canadian government, through a statement or in international forums, will take the lead in welcoming the development of projects that provide greater access to abortion and reproductive health services around the world. While interfering in the national policy processes of other countries is out of the question, Canada must nonetheless be vocal and offer assistance to countries that request it, to enable the development of essential reproductive health care services. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8767194" data-originallang="fr"> Thirdly, funding is a central issue, and several witnesses, including Oxfam-Québec, Oxfam-Canada and Action Canada, [all] raised concerns about the government's commitment to devote $700 million a year to support sexual and reproductive health and rights, with a particular focus on four neglected areas: family planning and contraception; safe and legal abortion services and post-abortion care; comprehensive sexuality education; and sexual and reproductive health and rights promotion activities. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8767195" data-originallang="fr">I would also like to point out that some witnesses told us some rather disturbing things. In countries with tougher anti-abortion laws, there are not fewer abortions. Rather, there are fewer safe abortions, and therefore more deaths. Several witnesses pointed out that most maternal deaths are preventable. Here is another excerpt from the report:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8767196" data-originallang="fr"> According to the office of the United Nations (UN) High Commissioner for Human Rights, </p>
<p data-HoCid="8767197" data-originallang="fr"> Women's sexual and reproductive health is related to multiple human rights, including the right to life, the right to be free from torture, the right to health, the right to privacy, the right to education, and the prohibition of discrimination. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) have both clearly indicated that women's right to health includes their sexual and reproductive health. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8767198" data-originallang="fr">International political agreements reinforce this position.</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8767199" data-originallang="fr"> In 1995, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action [which we talked about a lot] reinforced...and explicitly enshrined women's rights as human rights. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8767200" data-originallang="fr">It is crazy that women's rights were not recognized as human rights until 1995. That was not that long ago. The report later mentions “the Muskoka Initiative on Maternal, Newborn and Child Health, which was launched in 2010”. Numerous international agreements have echoed that call for Canada to do more. Here is what the report says about the four neglected areas:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8767201" data-originallang="fr"> These four issues received $104 million of the total funding of $489 million for the same year. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8767202" data-originallang="fr"> If the committee's report correctly recommends the need for the government to meet its commitment to invest at least $700 million in women's sexual and reproductive health and rights globally by the end of fiscal 2023-2024, we ask that the government significantly increase its funding in the four neglected topics. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8767203" data-originallang="fr">Members of the Global Cooperation Caucus are constantly reminded about them. These four neglected areas keep coming up. International co-operation organizations reach out to us about them, and representatives of all the parties hear the same thing. It really is important to keep in mind that we hear about this regularly.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8767204" data-originallang="fr">Upholding the right to safe abortions, just like the prevention and treatment of HIV-AIDS and sexually transmitted infections, is an important medical and socio-economic issue. It is worrisome. We are also often reminded of that by the organizations working on the ground. Cases of HIV-AIDS are on the rise in certain places in Africa, and again, women are disproportionately affected. As I said, there are also sexually transmitted infections. To that category, we can add HPV, human papillomavirus, which can be avoided through vaccination. We were reminded of the World Health Organization's vaccination objectives, because it is a virus that can lead to cancer but that is preventable by vaccine. Canada is missing its target, however. There is a tremendous amount of work to be done on these issues.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8767205" data-originallang="fr">This week, I attended a breakfast meeting where it was mentioned that cases of HIV-AIDS in indigenous communities are on the rise here in Canada. That is extremely concerning. Canada is actually falling behind compared to the other G7 countries. Canada is the only country where cases are on the rise, including because of this increase in indigenous communities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8767206" data-originallang="fr">“Fourthly, we heard the poignant testimony of Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko, who spoke of the Russian army's use of sexual violence as a weapon of war.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8767207" data-originallang="fr">I had the opportunity to meet this MP for the first time in October 2022 at an Inter-Parliamentary Union assembly in Kigali, Rwanda. We had an opportunity to have a conversation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8767208" data-originallang="fr">It is very troubling to see this “barbarity without a name that must lead to the criminalization of the perpetrators”. That is the message that she wants to send to us. She was travelling around, and she also came here, to Parliament, to draw our attention to this issue. My colleague from <a data-HoCid="278348" href="/politicians/martin-champoux/" title="Martin Champoux">Drummond</a> also met with female Ukrainian MPs who told him about the horrors that are happening right now in that conflict zone.</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8767209" data-originallang="fr"> This committee has already recommended to the government, in its report on the situation in Ukraine, that it “work with Ukraine and other international partners to prosecute those most responsible for Russia's crime of aggression against Ukraine by supporting the creation of a special tribunal for the crime of aggression against Ukraine or other similar mechanism”. In the quest for justice, sexual violence cannot be ignored when condemning Russia. And unfortunately, such situations are commonplace, since as the Canadian Partnership for Children's and Women's Health points out, “Women and girls continue to bear the brunt of the consequences of forced displacement, particularly in conflict zones where they face soaring levels of sexual violence”. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8767210" data-originallang="fr"> We therefore expect that in the next National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security, the Government of Canada will increase its funding for programs enabling girls and women who are victims of sexual violence in conflict zones to obtain the justice they deserve. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8767211" data-originallang="fr">The goal is to stop women and girls from being used as weapons of war in these conflict zones, which, as we see, are growing in number at the moment. Unfortunately, women are paying the price.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8767212" data-originallang="fr">I would like to return to a question the Bloc Québécois has been raising all morning as part of this debate, namely the question of religion as it relates to sexual and reproductive rights. Witnesses came to testify in committee about religious opposition to the question of abortion out of principle and religious belief, which is harming women's health. It is not right for people to use religion in such a way that women have to pay for it with their lives or their health. I will go even further. One should not use religion to engage in hate speech. This is an opportunity to re-emphasize the importance of secularism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8767213" data-originallang="fr">I could talk about the situation of women in Iran, which relates to this issue of secularism. The Bloc Québécois was the first to move a motion following the death of Mahsa Amini, who was killed for wearing her veil improperly. It is absurd that today, in 2024, women are still dying for not wearing a piece of cloth properly. We will continue supporting Iranian women in their struggle for secularism. The same applies to Afghanistan. The Taliban regime is rolling back women's rights. In my Inter-Parliamentary Union meetings I have had exchanges with Afghani parliamentarians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8767214" data-originallang="fr">To get back to the October 2022 general assembly, I met with parliamentarians there, but only male parliamentarians. I was told that women had not won the right to leave the country. They had not managed to get the proper chaperone, which would have allowed them to attend this general assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union to express themselves as female members of parliament. This issue is crucial, because the objective of this general assembly was to determine how to achieve a more representative, and hence democratic, kind of parliament. We need to hear these women's viewpoints. They are entitled to be present in the public sphere, which is not the case right now. They are being excluded, and the rights they had won in Afghanistan are being rolled back. This is extremely troubling.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8767215" data-originallang="fr">I will take this opportunity to remind my fellow members of the importance of the Bloc Québécois bill aimed at repealing this religious exemption. Ottawa must take concrete action to counter hate speech, which has been rising especially since the start of the war in the Middle East. What we are seeing now, however, is that the Criminal Code still protects people who willingly foment hate when their words are uttered in good faith and based on a religious text in which they believe.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8767216" data-originallang="fr">The elimination of the religious exemption in the Criminal Code, an exemption that also compromises the government's religious neutrality, is crucial to safety. Right here, right now, it is creating tension and conflict. It is for this reason that the Bloc Québécois introduced Bill <a data-HoCid="12734364" href="/bills/44-1/C-367/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (promotion of hatred or antisemitism)">C-367</a>. It was to close this loophole in the Criminal Code that permits hate speech if it is ultimately motivated by religion. Unfortunately, the content of the bill apparently did not please the government, which we have a hard time understanding, considering it calls itself feminist. Separating church and state gives women power. That is really what we found out from the committee study. The witnesses who came to tell us that abortion is bad were hiding behind religious beliefs and motivations. I would like to remind my colleagues that women are still dying today in countries where they do not have access to safe abortions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8767217" data-originallang="fr">In conclusion, now more than ever, Canada needs to update its feminist foreign policy and respond to the Auditor General's questions and concerns. COVID-19 and the growing number of conflicts and natural disasters caused by climate change are all factors that are changing the world order and current priorities. As a G7 nation, Canada must step up and start walking the talk. It is our duty to help women and girls in all these places around the world where they are being subjected to heinous sexual acts and losing their rights. We have to do our part. That is what the world is asking us to do.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8767218" data-originallang="fr">The major international co-operation organizations are reminding us of our obligations as a G7 nation. There are female parliamentarians on the ground who are worried. Just a few days ago, female MPs from Ukraine came to tell us about advancements that have been made possible thanks to technology, but also to share their concerns. They need our help to continue participating in the democratic life of their country. The same is true for all women in situations of conflict or war. They need help to regain their rights as women, to have access to safe sexual and reproductive health care and to play their role in society to the fullest. We should not leave them stuck in this situation where the only thing that is happening is an erosion of their rights. On that note, I urge everyone to take action, and I am ready to take questions from my colleagues.</p>
