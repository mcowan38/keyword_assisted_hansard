<p data-HoCid="8576698" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I agree. We have lost so many innocent lives. The people of Palestine are not Hamas, just as the people of Lebanon are not Hezbollah. They are like any one of us. They want to live their life. They want a place to call home, where they have safety and protection. They are our fathers and mothers, our brothers and sisters, our sons and daughters. It is very important that we stand up. Canada should play the role of peacebuilder, for which it is known; make sure we ask for a ceasefire; and show through action that this violence needs to end, that this escalation needs to end. We have seen so many people lost. </p>
