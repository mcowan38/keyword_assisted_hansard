<p data-HoCid="8084700" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, as I said, the Conservatives on the opposite side filibustered all 10 meetings we have had on Bill <a data-HoCid="12525473" href="/bills/44-1/C-50/" title="An Act respecting accountability, transparency and engagement to support the creation of sustainable jobs for workers and economic growth in a net-zero economy">C-50</a>. Constituents back home know this. Residents know this. Canadians know this. They send us here. We are paid by the taxpayers, and all the opposite side has done is waste time and resources. We could have had witnesses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8084701" data-originallang="en">The MP has used language that I am befuddled by, such as “globalist”. The MP says, in the video that they put out a few days ago, that it is the final solution. It is language that is purely, I would say, anti-Semitic and, second, purely wrong.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8084702" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, through you—</p>
