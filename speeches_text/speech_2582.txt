<p data-HoCid="7964440" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7964441" data-originallang="en">My thoughts go out to those who are impacted in Israel, West Bank and Gaza. It's a very tragic situation and extremely disturbing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7964442" data-originallang="en">Thank you for coming in, Ms. Hogan, and for coming in person. I think we all appreciate that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7964443" data-originallang="en">Without a doubt, the ArriveCAN study is important, with or without the new information. I have to admit that I'm a bit puzzled by the assertion that an emergency meeting was required on this topic, especially since the Office of the Auditor General is already working on the study report.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7964444" data-originallang="en">For Canadians at home who are not familiar with the Office of the Auditor General, can you please describe your mandate and how you work with the government on this committee?</p>
