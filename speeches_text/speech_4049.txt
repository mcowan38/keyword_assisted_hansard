<p data-HoCid="8366143" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, Mr. Fayaz Karim, a former NDP candidate for Mississauga—Streetsville , recently posted anti-Semitic comments and personal insults against me on his X account. The posts were disturbing. Among other things, he accused me of being a “Zionist whore” and a “Zionist prostitute”. There is no place for such language by this former NDP candidate. Respectable debate and different opinions are fair; this vindictive bile is not. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8366144" data-originallang="en">Mr. Karim also attacked British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak for his support of Israel. He wrote that Prime Minister Sunak needed a history lesson on the last six months and referred to him as a “house coolie”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8366145" data-originallang="en">The NDP tries to pass itself off as a party of inclusion and diversity, but one would not know it with Mr. Karim in its midst. Is this the type of person the NDP wants in its party? I call upon the <a data-HoCid="278714" href="/politicians/jagmeet-singh/" title="Jagmeet Singh">NDP leader</a> to denounce these anti-Semitic, racist and insulting ravings.</p>
