<p data-HoCid="6813980" data-originallang="fr">I will be quick, Mr. Chair. Since 2014, a total of 21 Canadians have lost their lives at the hands of ideologically motivated violent extremists, not including the victims of the attack in London. That's more than any other form of extremism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6813981" data-originallang="fr">In terms of concrete steps parliamentarians can take, we need to hold these meetings and invite representatives of the National Council of Canadian Muslims. As Mr. Harris suggested, we should ask them what concrete actions they want us to take to fight the scourges of Islamophobia, anti-Semitism and racism in Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6813982" data-originallang="fr">This would also be an opportunity for them to go on the record before a parliamentary committee, given what a timely and sensitive issue this is. That is something concrete that we, as parliamentarians, can do. I support Ms. Damoff's motion or a similar motion to move up the meetings we already had scheduled to discuss this issue.</p>
