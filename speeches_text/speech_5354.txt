<p data-HoCid="8669756" data-originallang="en">Thanks very much, Madam Speaker. I hope members opposite have not used up all of their clever heckles while they are sitting down, because I want to hear what they have to say when they stand up and it is their turn to speak. Sometimes, when I do school visits, teachers have to remind their students they should not speak out of turn. They are usually in grade 5, so 10 years old and 11 years old. It is disappointing to see the Conservatives using similar tactics as schoolchildren do. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8669757" data-originallang="en">I want to talk about Bill <a data-HoCid="13188699" href="/bills/44-1/C-73/" title="An Act respecting transparency and accountability in relation to certain commitments Canada has made under the Convention on Biological Diversity">C-73</a>, which is an act respecting transparency and accountability in relation to certain commitments Canada has made under the Convention on Biological Diversity.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8669758" data-originallang="en">Canada is a huge country. We have so much biological diversity from coast to coast to coast. We have a global obligation. This is not a choice. We need to protect it. We are the stewards of this global biodiversity framework. We hosted the meeting in Montreal last year and have made that commitment internationally. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8669759" data-originallang="en">We know the Conservatives have talked about commitments as outlandish as leaving the United Nations altogether. They make fun of the sustainable development goals. They ridicule members like me when we wear our SDG pins in the House. In fact, they promote this misinformation, and actually it is disinformation because it is quite harmful, about some kind of a globalist agenda with respect to the SDGs. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8669760" data-originallang="en">I wonder if the Conservative members ever read what the 17 SDGs are. If they would like, they could perhaps share which sustainable development goal they find most reprehensible. Perhaps it is clean water; perhaps it is no hunger; perhaps it is education for all, or perhaps it is equity. Perhaps it is partnerships, because we know the Conservatives think they can operate in a silo all on their own, without international co-operation, without international frameworks and agreements, and without attending United Nations meetings or going to COP. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8669761" data-originallang="en">The Conservatives think Canada is this tiny island that can operate alone. They think we do not have any obligations to lower our emissions here, despite them being some of the highest in the world, or obligations to promote biodiversity and end nature loss. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8669762" data-originallang="en">I will just end by saying nuclear energy is an asset and a solution to the triple threat of pollution, climate change and biodiversity loss we are experiencing. It is irresponsible to suggest otherwise and it is reckless to not take action. I am proud to be standing here on the government side with a government that is taking action on all three and utilizing every tool in our tool box to achieve those goals. </p>
