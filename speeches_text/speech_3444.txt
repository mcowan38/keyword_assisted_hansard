<p data-HoCid="8212079" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair. It is good to see all of you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8212080" data-originallang="fr">I'm pleased to see you all here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8212081" data-originallang="en">Canada finds itself in a growing international security crisis. It is undeniable. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8212082" data-originallang="en">Just a few days ago I was in Kyiv, delivering a clear message from our government to Ukrainians that we are not going anywhere and we will be there for as long as it takes. Canada will continue to support Ukraine's fight for freedom through to the end of the war but also beyond. This is why Canada and Ukraine have launched an international coalition to bring Ukrainian children back home. We want to make sure that kids are never used as pawns in wartime.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8212083" data-originallang="en">Even after the war, Ukraine will be next door to a very dangerous neighbour, Russia. We know that in that context, Canada must be able to help Ukraine defend itself and show deterrence in light of danger. That is why I was there, and we have been working on advancing Canada's long-term bilateral security commitments to Ukraine to deter future Russian aggression.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8212084" data-originallang="fr">Unfortunately, that's not the only conflict in the world that Canadians are concerned about. We're all deeply troubled by the devastating scenes coming out of the Middle East, whether it be the Hamas terrorist attack against Israel on October 7, which we continue to roundly condemn, or the death toll from the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, which we are all extremely concerned about.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8212085" data-originallang="fr">Our government continues to support urgent efforts to secure an agreement to free hostages. It will allow for more humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza and it will force Hamas to lay down its arms. We hope that this agreement will eventually lead to a sustainable ceasefire as well as a two-state solution.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8212086" data-originallang="en"> Whether in Khan Yunis, in Kherson or even in Khartoum, the rules-based system that has kept Canadians safe for generations is cracking. We are all facing increasingly complex modern challenges—disinformation and the rise of AI and political polarization, including the rise of extremist and populist movements even here in Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8212087" data-originallang="en">We cannot let bad actors exploit this uncertainty with impunity. In rising to meet these challenges, I have been clear that our government's foreign policy will be guided by two key principles.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8212088" data-originallang="en">The first one is that we absolutely need to defend Canada's sovereignty. Our national interests require it and our national security depends on it. We must stand firm and defend the rules-based system and the institutions that have kept us safe.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8212089" data-originallang="en">The second is pragmatic diplomacy. We need to engage in pragmatic diplomacy to work with countries of different perspectives to prevent an international conflict. I don't believe in the empty chair policy. We will never compromise our values and we will never compromise our national interests.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8212090" data-originallang="en">In what we do on the world stage to make sure that we succeed, we must be present globally with our eyes and ears on the ground. Our diplomats must be diverse, bilingual, healthy and well equipped.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8212091" data-originallang="en">Last fall, we released a detailed plan to transform Global Affairs Canada for the future of diplomacy. It is more important than ever that this plan be implemented, and thank you to Antoine and David for working actively on this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8212092" data-originallang="en">This plan has four points.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8212093" data-originallang="fr">First, there is a need to invest in our people, in “our world” as we say. That includes recruiting a diplomatic corps that is representative of Canada in all its diversity. Francophones must be able to speak their mother tongue and we need to speak more foreign languages and speak them better. We also need to provide greater support to our diplomats and their families abroad.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8212094" data-originallang="en">Second, we must increase our presence where it matters most. This means expanding our influence in key multilateral institutions, including, of course, the United Nations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8212095" data-originallang="en">We must also grow our diplomatic footprint in key regions such as eastern Europe, Africa and the Indo-Pacific. This is something our government has already begun doing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8212096" data-originallang="en">Third, we need to enhance our policy expertise to better anticipate and manage prolonged crises like climate change, as well as the issue of AI and the digital world.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8212097" data-originallang="en">Last but not least, we must have the tools and processes to be efficient and to be better protected from cyber-threats, which are currently top of mind for all of us.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8212098" data-originallang="fr">I'm ready to answer your questions.</p>
