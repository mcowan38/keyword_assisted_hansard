<p data-HoCid="8145041" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8145042" data-originallang="en"> <em>Bonjour</em> and good day, honourable members of the House of Commons subcommittee on human rights. Thank you so much for inviting us to join you today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8145043" data-originallang="en">Today's critical dialogue centres on fostering inclusivity within educational systems, ensuring that they cater to the entire disability spectrum, with particular attention to the often-neglected cognitive, communicative and behavioural disabilities. I'm here to highlight the importance of advancing this cause and to share several potential evidence-based approaches to support this committee's work. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8145044" data-originallang="en">The conversations today are in the spirit of the sustainable development goals to leave no one behind. Inclusion must be aligned with not only the SDGs but also the fundamental rights of persons with disabilities, as enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It means inclusion for persons with disability in all spaces, including education, health and employment, notwithstanding that within communities....</p>
<p data-HoCid="8145045" data-originallang="en">Despite this, it would be fair to say that in all contexts in societies, persons with disability are far from realizing these fundamental rights. Within this group of persons, those with cognitive, communication and behavioural disabilities are particularly disadvantaged. COVID-19 exacerbated this, particularly in LMICs, where children with disability were disproportionately affected.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8145046" data-originallang="en">In our global educational systems, the needs of differently abled individuals are frequently marginalized. These disabilities, encompassing a range, demand a nuanced and empathetic educational approach. In areas of limited resources, conflict settings and within displaced populations, these challenges are compounded. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8145047" data-originallang="en">It's within this context that we encounter a pivotal concernâ€”namely, the intersection of limited literacy and disabilities. This intersection uncovers a profound gap in our current educational models. It necessitates an urgent need for a comprehensive approach that caters to individuals from early development through adulthood, embracing all learning styles and recognizing the distinct ways that people with disabilities process and engage with information.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8145048" data-originallang="en">I want to bring some of those points to life with a story of a community health worker I worked with, a community health worker from the West Bank with a cognitive disability. We ran a pilot project in the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine and through my organization, CISEPO, to teach skills to improve women's health in a resource-limited and complex setting. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8145049" data-originallang="en"> Amira grew up in a community with scant educational support. She faced daily struggles that left her feeling isolated. This program offered a lifeline with tailored cognitive training that tapped into her innate strengths, coupled with social skill-building sessions. The intervention included the use of adaptive learning technologies and personalized teaching methods. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8145050" data-originallang="en">Her progress was incredible. She evolved from a reticent individual into an empowered community health advocate. Her progress wasn't only cognitive; it was also social. She became an active member of the community health program, demonstrating incredible empathy and engagement with other local women seeking health education. She went from being a hesitant learner to a confident health advocate. That alone illustrates the potential of inclusive education when it's rooted in respect for individual rights and capabilities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8145051" data-originallang="en">Building on practical experiences like this and best practices grounded in evidence, we would suggest several key recommendations. We feel that it is imperative to integrate life-cycle education into our strategies, acknowledging that disability is not unique to any one stage of life. From prenatal through adolescent health and elder care, there is room to design and implement programs that address the needs of those who are differently abled so that they may receive services and engage to provide services in the context of workforce capacity-building. We can and should adapt our methods to cater to the diverse needs of individuals with disabilities throughout their lives.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8145052" data-originallang="en">Second, the implementation of task-sharing models is crucial. This involves empowering not only educators but also community members, caregivers and peers in the educational process. Furthermore, technology must be levered judiciously to bridge the educational divide. We need to develop and implement digital solutions, including ICT, that are accessible to all, ensuring that technology serves as an enabler and not a barrier to learning.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8145053" data-originallang="en">Third, we need to look beyond the educational sector itself and foster interdisciplinary collaborations involving health care, social service and community organizations. These partnerships can offer holistic support to students with disabilities, addressing their educational, social and health needs. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8145054" data-originallang="en"> We heavily suggest that a mandate be implemented for all funding decisions, one that requires a demonstration of a clear commitment with specific metrics towards the inclusion of children with disabilities. Measurement is critical to spur change, and doing it well necessitates co-operation and partnerships outside of silos. In our globalized world, we need to make a concerted effort to convene these types of partnerships outside of Canada, as well, and tap into international collaboration and co-operation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8145055" data-originallang="en">Funding these partnerships on a participatory basis is also key. We need to look beyond our borders, learning from and supporting each other in our quest to provide inclusive education. </p>
