<p data-HoCid="8369901" data-originallang="en">Irrespective of what happens with this private member's bill today, we should begin our study of anti-Semitism. I'm not framing that as a motion; I'm asking members to agree that we will begin our study on anti-Semitism on Monday. If members around the table agree to that then there's nothing to prevent it from happening on Monday. </p>
