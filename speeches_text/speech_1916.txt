<p data-HoCid="7311456" data-originallang="en">Thank you so much, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7311457" data-originallang="en">I want to thank all of the witnesses for being here today. I particularly want to thank Mr. Sims, who is up very early in the morning in Australia. For those of you who don't know, Mr. Sims was called “the most feared man” in Australian business by the Australian Financial Review. He's quite an impressive witness to have.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7311458" data-originallang="en">I also want to take this opportunity to wish Mr. Skok, Dr. Geist and everyone in Canada's Jewish community a very happy new year, which starts on Sunday night.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7311459" data-originallang="en">Let me come to my first question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7311460" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Skok, I'm going to go to you. Dr. Geist just said that this is not about journalism. Do you think this bill is about journalism?</p>
