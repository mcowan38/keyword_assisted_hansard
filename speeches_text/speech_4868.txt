<p data-HoCid="8576383" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, when it comes to arms exports, the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="MÃ©lanie Joly">minister</a> has said that we have not approved export permits since January 8. We will always support Israel's security, and this includes permits for the Iron Dome. I would disagree with the hon. member that we are not doing anything. I firmly believe that we are, in fact, doing everything that we can as a country to work toward a ceasefire in the region and for peace in the region.</p>
