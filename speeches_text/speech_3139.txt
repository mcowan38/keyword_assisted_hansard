<p data-HoCid="8074186" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, today we mark the expulsion of nearly one million Jews from Arab countries and Iran following the creation of the State of Israel. Their expulsion was motivated by persecutions, pogroms and genocide.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8074187" data-originallang="en">Many Jewish families found safe harbour in Canada, a significant number of whom put down roots in my riding of Eglinton—Lawrence. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8074188" data-originallang="en">Despite their exceptional contributions, Jews have continued to face a torrent of anti-Semitism. Tragically, the October 7 terrorist attack in Israel has exacerbated this hate: Jewish day schools have been shot at, synagogues firebombed, students swarmed on campuses and businesses accosted. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8074189" data-originallang="en">As Canadians, we should universally condemn these appalling incidents, and those responsible must be brought to justice by law enforcement. We must also strengthen Holocaust remembrance and education. Today, B’nai Brith is hosting a virtual commemoration of the story of Jews who were expelled from Arab countries and Iran. I encourage all to visit its website and learn, because it is only through learning, education and respect that we can ultimately defeat anti-Semitism and hatred in all its forms.</p>
