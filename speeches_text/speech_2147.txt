<p data-HoCid="7640411" data-originallang="fr">There are major differences between the Israeli and Canadian models. To begin with, the Israelis are not afraid to focus on key technological sectors. Nor are they afraid of putting a great deal of money into one or more companies when they think they can be successful. It's a highly targeted approach, whereas in Canada, when you look at a tax credit for research and development, the approach is much more widespread and highly horizontal. We're trying to give a little bit to everyone so that everyone can do a bit of research and development. That's the biggest difference between the two models.</p>
