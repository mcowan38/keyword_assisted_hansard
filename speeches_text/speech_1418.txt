<p data-HoCid="7002347" data-originallang="fr">Thank you very much, Ms. Nivyabandi. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7002348" data-originallang="fr">I also saw some quite distressing things in Palestine. Palestinians could not take some bus routes and highways. I would not have believed that I could be seeing something of the kind at the beginning of the 21st century, not just in Israel, but in any democratic state, where one would think that human rights are protected.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002349" data-originallang="fr">What really shocked me were the arrests and trials of Palestinian children by Israeli armed forces. We met a group of lawyers defending those children, those teenagers, arrested for causing a slight disturbance or for throwing a couple of things.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002350" data-originallang="fr">Is that part of your analysis of the human rights situation in Palestine, Ms. Langlois?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002351" data-originallang="fr">Can you give us some more details about it?</p>
