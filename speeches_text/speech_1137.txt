<p data-HoCid="6791755" data-originallang="en">Obviously we have great concerns about Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism, and indeed, Iran's behaviour throughout the region—in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and in Gaza—is a serious concern for this conflict and for the broader regional peace and security.</p>
