<p data-HoCid="8406368" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8406369" data-originallang="fr">I'll try to cover all the bases in three minutes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8406370" data-originallang="fr">I gather from Ms. Cook's comments that universities should maintain an environment that doesn't allow this type of abuse. I agree. Mr. Oberman says that the police should step in and that the authorities should enforce the law. I agree with him too. Mr. Eshayek tells us that the current fight for the Jewish community isn't just for the Jewish community, but for all minority communities. I also agree with this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8406371" data-originallang="fr">The violence everywhere, especially on campuses, is a social issue. As I said earlier, I think that university campuses are wonderful places. They should be the most welcoming places in the world, where people are allowed to debate everything vigorously and authoritatively, but always respectfully. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8406372" data-originallang="fr">I totally agree with what you said. This situation is unacceptable.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8406373" data-originallang="fr">Ms. Cook, you said that it's important to maintain an environment that doesn't allow this type of abuse. In your opinion, are any other communities currently victims of this type of oppression, or is it just the Jewish community, to your knowledge?</p>
