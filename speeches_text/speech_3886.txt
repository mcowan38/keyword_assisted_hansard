<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak to a vital piece of legislation, the Canadian sustainable jobs act. </p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">To set the context, climate change is altering our world's natural environment in numerous harmful ways. In fact, last summer, Canadians experienced the worst wildfire season on record, destroying homes and livelihoods, blanketing cities and towns in smoke and putting brave first responders in harm's way. While some political leaders choose to deny, deflect and downplay such events, Canadians know the facts: Our planet is burning up, and climate change is the cause.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">At the same time, climate change is also rapidly transforming the global economy and finance in ways that are creating enormous economic opportunities for those who approach the shift to a low-carbon world in a thoughtful, determined and strategic manner. The global energy transition that is already well under way is both an environmental imperative to protect the planet for our children and an economic opportunity on a scale similar to that of the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">In releasing “World Energy Outlook 2023”, Dr. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, stated, “The transition to clean energy is happening worldwide and it’s unstoppable. It’s not a question of ‘if’, it’s just a matter of ‘how soon’”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">The majority of Canadians are indeed concerned about climate change, but they are also concerned about their economic situation, and they want good jobs and economic opportunities for themselves and their children in the future.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">In order for Canada to seize the extraordinary opportunities offered by the transition to a net-zero economy, we must accept the scientific reality of climate change and ensure that it informs and shapes Canada's economic strategy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Since 2015, the federal government has committed almost $200 billion to the fight against climate change and to accelerating the development of a prosperous low-carbon economy. This includes the nearly $86 billion that last year's budget committed for tools, including major investment tax credits, to accelerate clean growth and ensure Canadian competitiveness; we are seeing significant progress from these investments right across the country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">In Newfoundland, Braya Renewable Fuels is converting its refinery to renewable diesel. In Nova Scotia, EverWind Fuels recently received approval to build North America's first facility to produce hydrogen from renewables.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">In Quebec, progress was made on new lithium mines and the announcement of TES Canada's $4-billion hydrogen project.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">In Ontario, we are seeing massive investments in the entirety of the electric vehicle value chain. In Saskatchewan, BHP is constructing the largest potash mine with the lowest emissions in the world. Companies in Alberta are developing net-zero and low-carbon industrial facilities, including Air Products' clean hydrogen facility and Dow's recently announced $12-billion net-zero petrochemical facility. In B.C., the recently announced $1-billion investment in the E-One Moli battery facility will create almost 500 jobs and will generate further employment in upstream activities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">To date, we have invested over $1.5 billion in measures for skills programming, supporting communities and industries across the country. The sustainable jobs action plan and the sustainable jobs act are both about creating low-carbon economic opportunities in all regions of the country that will create jobs and opportunities for generations. They are about ensuring that we prepare workers and communities to fully seize these opportunities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">As far as this piece of legislation is concerned, there are five key elements.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">Firstly, the bill establishes guiding principles that ensure workers are at the heart of building a net-zero future. The original bill was enhanced by an amendment to include additional considerations of environmental sustainability and equity. This amendment ensures alignment with commitments made under the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act and Canada's 2030 emissions reduction plan.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Secondly, the bill would create a sustainable jobs partnership council composed of Canadians from sectors involved in the shift to a net-zero economy. This part of the bill reflects a tripartite-plus approach, ensuring dialogue among industry, labour, indigenous and other experts in policy-making. Amendments to the original bill provide further clarity about the exact composition of the council, as well as the co-chair and member appointments. This council would provide valuable advice to the Government of Canada, sourced, in part, from dialogues engaged in across the country, ensuring diverse and well-informed perspectives to shape policy recommendations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">Thirdly, accountability is reinforced by the requirement to publish action plans every five years. Amendments to the original bill in this section will ensure that areas of federal-provincial co-operation are taken into account in the development of action plans. The amendments will also ensure that analyses are regularly conducted to assess how action plan measures interact with those of Canada's emissions reduction plan.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Fourthly, this bill would establish a sustainable jobs secretariat to coordinate intergovernmental efforts and enforce compliance with the acts.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">Finally, the bill designates the ministers responsible for implementing the act and the plan.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Overall, the amendments being made to this bill are the product of work by committee members, very much including Liberal and NDP members, with some helpful assistance from the member for <a data-HoCid="278335" href="/politicians/mario-simard/" title="Mario Simard">Jonquière</a>. I would like to specifically thank my Liberal colleagues, the members for <a data-HoCid="278601" href="/politicians/julie-dabrusin/" title="Julie Dabrusin">Toronto—Danforth</a>, <a data-HoCid="278598" href="/politicians/george-chahal/" title="George Chahal">Calgary Skyview</a>, <a data-HoCid="278590" href="/politicians/john-aldag/" title="John Aldag">Cloverdale—Langley City</a>, <a data-HoCid="278666" href="/politicians/viviane-lapointe/" title="Viviane LaPointe">Sudbury</a>, <a data-HoCid="278684" href="/politicians/francesco-sorbara/" title="Francesco Sorbara">Vaughan—Woodbridge</a>, <a data-HoCid="278677" href="/politicians/marc-serre/" title="Marc Serré">Nickel Belt</a> and <a data-HoCid="278108" href="/politicians/yvonne-jones/" title="Yvonne Jones">Labrador</a>, for their hard work and dedication. I must also say it has been a pleasure working with the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278641" href="/politicians/charlie-angus/" title="Charlie Angus">Timmins—James Bay</a>, whose passion for this work is a strong example of the dedication he has brought to two decades of service to his constituents. He will be missed in the House of Commons.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">The amendments noted would enhance legislated transparency, ensure effective representation on the partnership council, secure strong linkage to the climate accountability legislation and emphasize the pivotal role of provinces, territories and other levels of government as key partners in advancing sustainable job opportunities. This bill has gained strong support on the part of the labour movement and civil society. I want to thank leaders in the labour movement, and Bea Bruske in particular, for their strong and active support.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">This legislation underscores the government's commitment to working collaboratively and thoughtfully to advance the prosperity and well-being of all regions of Canada, of all communities and of all workers as we look to seize the massive economic opportunities before us.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">The fact of the matter is that this legislation represents a thoughtful approach to the future. It has been supported by Clean Energy Canada, the Canadian Labour Congress, the Business Council of Alberta, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the Climate Action Network, Electricity Human Resources Canada, the United Steelworkers, Environmental Defence, the International Union of Operating Engineers, the Pembina Institute, the Power Workers' Union and many more.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Unfortunately, Conservatives' contempt for Canadian workers led them to engage in months of shenanigans in committee that I could only characterize as legislative vandalism. The fact is that not only has the opposition's obstructionism been a roadblock to environmental progress, but it also represents a direct attack on our economy and the livelihoods and prospects for generations of Canadian workers. In order to keep workers from the decision-making table, the Conservative Party submitted over 20,000 amendments on an 11-page bill.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">I repeat, the Conservative Party of Canada submitted more than 20,000 amendments to an 11-page bill. Canadians expect better. They expect us to take this work seriously, to look at the bill first and to speak to the substance of the bill, even if we disagree. With their stunts, the Conservatives have proven that they have no interest in dialogue or serious governance issues.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">They have been busy dog whistling about globalist plots and are increasingly denying the reality of climate change while they neglect their responsibility as parliamentarians, which is to act in the interest of the long-term prosperity of Canadians. For too long, the opposition has put the interests of an extreme climate-denying fringe above the well-being of our planet and of Canadian workers.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">As we work to build a thriving, dynamic and prosperous low-carbon economy, we must ensure Canadian communities and Canadian workers remain at the centre of this critical work. That is precisely what this legislation would do. I implore all parliamentarians to stand with Canadian workers, who are calling on us to support Bill <a data-HoCid="12525473" href="/bills/44-1/C-50/" title="An Act respecting accountability, transparency and engagement to support the creation of sustainable jobs for workers and economic growth in a net-zero economy">C-50</a>.</p>
