<p data-HoCid="6737547" data-originallang="en">Certainly, it is a very dynamic situation going on currently in Israel. I don't want to speak too much about a current active environment. The conflict zone information office is actively monitoring that, engaging in regular conversation with Air Canada, our only carrier that flies into Tel Aviv, as well as with other regulators—international regulators such as the FAA and other regulators—to ensure that the measures being taken by the state, by Israel, are sufficient so that we're assured of aviation safety. We will monitor that. We're monitoring it continually, and we'll adjust as necessary.</p>
