<p data-HoCid="8455601" data-originallang="en">Thank you to all the witnesses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455602" data-originallang="en">I'll start with you, Mr. Miller. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8455603" data-originallang="en">I have to say that one of the challenges I'm facing today is that there's a gap between what the students told us at the press conference, what the students told us here in their testimony and what you're saying, which are very nice words. They're very reassuring. However, there seems to be a disconnect between what they're experiencing and what you're saying on behalf of universities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455604" data-originallang="en">Maybe I'll start with this point. When the special envoy, Deborah Lyons, came to speak here, she said, “we have not had our brains shrunk, either by COVID or by social media. We are capable of holding two thoughts in our [brain].... It is possible to be pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian at the same time. Canadians have that capacity.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455605" data-originallang="en"> As universities, you are there to help foster respectful dialogue and disagreement.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455606" data-originallang="en"> What are the universities doing to actually broach that problem? Right now, we're hearing that it's not respectful on campuses.</p>
