<p data-HoCid="6027054" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, 75 years ago, the world discovered a whole new dimension to the horrors of war. Seventy-five years ago to the day, we discovered Auschwitz. Within its walls, over one million men, women and children were murdered because of their religion. They were killed because they were Jewish.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6027055" data-originallang="fr">Today, it is our duty to take a moment to reflect on the memory of these victims of genocide. It is also our duty to pay tribute to the memory of the survivors. Some of them are still among us. Their lives changed forever. It is our duty to remember the emaciated faces of those subjected to forced labour, violence, terror and grief. People who experienced Auschwitz will never forget it; nor must we. It is also our duty to take a stand against anti-Semitism wherever it appears and to ensure that this black mark on our history remains in the past. </p>
