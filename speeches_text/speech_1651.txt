<p data-HoCid="7133116" data-originallang="fr">It covers issues such as COVIDâ€‘19 support measures, employment insurance, fighting anti-Semitism, the Social Security Tribunal, aerospace and more.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7133117" data-originallang="fr">Every one of these topics deserves its own fulsome debate, but, no, they are using time allocation to shove it down our throats. Why deny democracy like this?</p>
