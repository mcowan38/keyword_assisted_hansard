<p data-HoCid="6511703" data-originallang="en">Okay. Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6511704" data-originallang="en"> I raised that point...and then to Ms. Gazan's points and all of the different groups she mentioned and the intersectionality lens that she wants to apply, I think we need to stick to the actual people, the indigenous people, we heard at this committee and to the points they were raising first and foremost. They were the ones we brought forward to the committee. I'm worried, with some of those comments, that we're going off what the witnesses were saying and just trying to add additional points right now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6511705" data-originallang="en"> Thirdly, I'm going to make a comment about Mr. Vaughan and Ms. Gazan talking about provincial governments. I just had an indigenous group in my riding rejected from the RHI, because they said that the on-reserve housing was specific. They were asking me why they were rejected already, when we all know that in their neck of the woods, housing is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6511706" data-originallang="en">With regard to comments about whatever provincial government is in question about their inability to provide housing, I would raise the same points about the ability of the federal government [<em>Technical difficulty--Editor</em>] lack of responsiveness that we heard about from Indigenous Services Canada on basic questions that the PBO was able to answer but they were reluctant to even respond to.</p>
