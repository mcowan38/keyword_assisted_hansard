<p data-HoCid="6791875" data-originallang="en">On settlements and changing of geography on the ground, we have been very strong and vocal that settlement, evictions and demolitions are illegal, are contrary to the Fourth Geneva Convention and must stop. We have articulated this to our partners and to our Israeli friends publicly many times, as have other partners as well. What I think we need to do collectively is that partners need to talk about getting the right conditions in place to move us closer to that two-state solution, and that includes stopping evictions in settlements, which are happening now. </p>
