<p data-HoCid="8202387" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, maintaining international peace and security are priority objectives of Canada's foreign policy. Civilians must be protected, and international law must be respected. Canada has one of the most rigorous export control systems in the world, and it is harmonized with those of our allies and partners. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8202388" data-originallang="en">When we look at permits for Israel in particular, let us be clear. In recent years, our government has not received and, therefore, not approved any export permits for weapons. The permits issued since October 7 and, in fact, all permits that are currently open are for non-lethal weapons.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8202389" data-originallang="en">I will repeat our calls for a sustainable ceasefire, for more aid to get into Gaza and for all hostages to be released. We remain committed to a two-state solution, with a Palestinian state living side by side with Israel. We firmly stand with the Israeli and Palestinian people in their right to live in peace, security, dignity and without fear.</p>
