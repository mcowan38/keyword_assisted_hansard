<p data-HoCid="8435184" data-originallang="en"> It's terrible. I can tell you that when the petition went around from the UBC medical students, we felt it like this massive gut punch. Worse than that, like the ovation that was heard at the University of Manitoba, was the silence from our colleagues. Not only was there silence, but there were social media attacks on students who said they wouldn't sign the petition. It was terrible for us.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435185" data-originallang="en">I can tell you, as an academic who has spent 30 years teaching and who loves teaching, I was truly afraid of an accusation of implicit harassment by these students, just by virtue of the fact that they may have found out that I'm Jewish and that I support the State of Israel. There's no way to defend ourselves against that harassment and that accusation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435186" data-originallang="en"> I'll make one last comment. I was in touch with physicians from Ontario yesterday. Over 110 physicians from Ontario, who are academic physicians, are almost certainly going to withdraw their affiliation with the University of Toronto because they are so ashamed. What we're looking at is a medical system across Canada that will soon be Judenrein if this continues.</p>
