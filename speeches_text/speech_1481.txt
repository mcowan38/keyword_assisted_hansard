<p data-HoCid="7063768" data-originallang="en">Ms. Abitan, a lot of what you spoke about and a lot of what I know Irwin Cotler has worked on has been around the suppression of journalists in non-democratic countries, and countries where the democracies are not strong or they're fragile if in existence at all.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7063769" data-originallang="en">We heard from Mr. Clifford today that these things are starting to happen. In regard to Hong Kong, we would never have imagined that we would be in a situation where media freedom in Hong Kong is, for all intents and purposes, gone.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7063770" data-originallang="en">What do we do? What is our role in protecting journalists when we see the behaviours of democracies acting incorrectly? </p>
<p data-HoCid="7063771" data-originallang="en">We heard last week of journalists being surveilled in Israel. We have seen examples where journalists have been hung out to dry in different countries that are democracies. How do we deal with that?</p>
