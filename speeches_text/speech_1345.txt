<p data-HoCid="6969973" data-originallang="en">Thank you so much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6969974" data-originallang="en">It's a pleasure to be part of this committee, a committee that I was on for many years. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6969975" data-originallang="en">It's such a thrill to see such incredible leaders. It's great to see you, Bonnie. It's been a while. Even on Zoom, it's really great.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6969976" data-originallang="en">I want to thank all of our witnesses for presenting today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6969977" data-originallang="en">Obviously, I know all of you have reflected on the barriers that women face, including economic insecurity. I am here replacing my colleague, <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Leah Gazan</a>, who has been a champion for a guaranteed livable income and has put forward legislation in the House now twice. I'm wondering if you could speak to how important it would be to move forward with a basic guaranteed livable income in support of women, including many women who have been severely set back during this crisis and also are rendered more vulnerable when they don't have income or some sort of economic security.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6969978" data-originallang="en">I'd love to hear from all of the witnesses. Perhaps I'll go to you first, Bonnie, and then perhaps to Ms. Witness 1 and Ms. Kamateros.</p>
