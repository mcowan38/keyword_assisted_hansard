<p data-HoCid="7611908" data-originallang="en">I can tell you that I'm talking to non-profit groups, and I'm sure there are other MPs who are talking to non-profit groups, and their projects are ready to roll out. They even have matching funds.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7611909" data-originallang="en"> In the case of British Columbia, there is a project in the riding of my colleague <a data-HoCid="278628" href="/politicians/richard-cannings/" title="Richard Cannings">Richard Cannings</a>. There's a letter from the Lower Columbia Affordable Housing Society in South Okanagan—West Kootenay. They're ready to go. They got their commitment, but they can't get the funding. Lo and behold, what's happened? The government—CMHC, through to the minister—made a decision that, instead of getting an estimated up to $50,000 to $75,000 per unit, they're now limited to only getting $25,000 per unit. As the cost is escalating, these projects will become unviable.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7611910" data-originallang="en">Various colleagues asking for help with projects were all responded to on February 8 with different responses signed by the minister. I have one letter signed by the minister to my colleague <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Leah Gazan</a>, regarding the situation in Winnipeg, telling people to go look to the coinvestment fund for funding. The people from the Lower Columbia Affordable Housing Society have been advised by CMHC that the money from the codevelopment fund has been depleted. There is no money to be had.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7611911" data-originallang="en"> Back in November of last year, around the same time, I wrote to the minister about the codevelopment fund, asking about the $25,000 limitation—when that kicked in and who made that decision. I got a response on February 8 as well, signed by the minister, talking about everything except the answer to that question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7611912" data-originallang="en">First off, I would dispute the notion that money is flowing when they're ready, because this project is ready. They're about to lose the funding. They're about to actually lose the project if they don't get the funding. This is the reality. They're ready to roll. The only ones holding them up happen to be CMHC on the codevelopment fund.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7611913" data-originallang="en"> On the issue of the $25,000 limitation, who made that decision and when did it come into play?</p>
