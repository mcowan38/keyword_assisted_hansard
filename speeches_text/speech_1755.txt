<p data-HoCid="7249400" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, Canadians are calling for the government to lift all federal COVID-19 restrictions and restore personal and health freedoms.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7249401" data-originallang="fr">Canadian provinces and businesses, along with other countries like the United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, Denmark and Israel, have lifted all of their COVID-19 restrictions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7249402" data-originallang="fr">The government says it is following the science and admits that it is now safe to sit next to someone who has not been vaccinated on a plane. However, it claims that it is dangerous for a trucker, travelling alone, to cross the border without being vaccinated. That is ridiculous.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7249403" data-originallang="fr">I agree with the people who signed my petition to lift all the COVID-19 restrictions.</p>
