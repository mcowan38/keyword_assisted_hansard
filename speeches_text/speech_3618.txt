<p data-HoCid="8276169" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to my colleague's statement. I must say I was surprised by its inflammatory tone.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8276170" data-originallang="fr">I was surprised that she seemed to see only one side of the matter. I was surprised by this inflammatory tone towards our colleague from <a data-HoCid="278368" href="/politicians/heather-mcpherson/" title="Heather McPherson">Edmonton Strathcona</a>, because she refuses to see the extent to which our colleagues from the New Democratic Party have sought, in their motion, to have a balanced approach that takes every aspect of the current situation into account.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8276171" data-originallang="fr">Our colleague was telling us that a negotiated solution must be the outcome. Certainly, but with whom do the parties negotiate, when one side says that they do not want to negotiate and that the two-state solution is not a solution?</p>
