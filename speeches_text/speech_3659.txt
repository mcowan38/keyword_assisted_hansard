<p data-HoCid="8277235" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I have three points.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8277236" data-originallang="en">First of all, to add to the point of order that has been made about decorum, the reality is that what happened here on a major issue of foreign policy is that the Liberals came in with a substantive amendment that would change seven out of nine components of the original motion, including changing the unilateral recognition of Palestine to something else, on the back of a napkin, and told the NDP what to do.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8277237" data-originallang="en">Point two is that anybody voting by app tonight will not have had a chance to see this, so there are going to be people at home who will not have seen it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8277238" data-originallang="en">The last component is language. This is one of the most substantive amendments that has been tabled in the House on a major point of foreign policy. Our peer nations are watching this. They are going to think this Parliament is a complete joke, because the government is coming in at the end and table-dropping the motion and expecting Parliament to vote on it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8277239" data-originallang="en">This sends a poor message to our peer nations, and the amendment should be ruled out of order.</p>
