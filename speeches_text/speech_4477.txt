<p data-HoCid="8455964" data-originallang="en">I am very happy that you explained to me what the justice committee is, but I have asked you a question. The question is, has anybody been suspended or expelled for their conduct on your university campuses, which has put Jewish students, students that are part of Jewish student groups and allies of those groups in danger? Answer yes or a no. </p>
