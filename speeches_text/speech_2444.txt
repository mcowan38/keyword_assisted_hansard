<p data-HoCid="7849590" data-originallang="en">Sure. It certainly happens. The crab fishery is a little different, because in most places it's almost a year-round fishery. In other fisheries maybe there are only 30 days or 60 days, a very short term, so you can make that debt mistake multiple times in one year and really get yourself in a spot. Because of the length of the season, crabbing is almost more like a job. You can do maybe one or two other fisheries a little bit, but you're committed almost the whole year to it, so if you do that, you and your crew are not making money for the whole year. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7849591" data-originallang="en">It's going to take a lot less time before it goes badly and your business evaporates than it would if you leased some halibut quota or a prawn licence. You can make that bad decision and you and the crew are done in a month, and then they go work some other job to make up for it or something. In crabbing, if you do that, it certainly exists, but those people, unfortunately, are discarded fairly quickly.</p>
