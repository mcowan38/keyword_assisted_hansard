<p data-HoCid="8406228" data-originallang="en"> I want to add that I'm here on behalf of the Canadian Union of Jewish Students. CUJS is a non-partisan organization that has multiple students who are involved in different political parties.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8406229" data-originallang="en">At the end of the day when we see a sign calling for an intifada, and at the end of the day when we are excluded from our classes and face violence, every single Jewish student is affected regardless of the fact they're NDP, Liberal, Bloc, Green or Conservative. We are all equally affected by this. In my role here, I want to raise awareness about the fact that we are all dealing with this. I may have my own opinions, and other people may have their own opinions, but I'm here talking on behalf of Jewish students.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8406230" data-originallang="en"> Yes, there is a feeling that we could get more support from the government. That is true. Some of us do feel that way, but we're working together to combat this hatred because everyone in this room here cares about anti-Semitism on campus, and I'm here on behalf of Canadian Union of Jewish Students to work with all of you, regardless of any partisanship that may be in this room.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8406231" data-originallang="en"> Thank you.</p>
