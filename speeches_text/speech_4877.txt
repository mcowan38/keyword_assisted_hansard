<p data-HoCid="8576457" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, as a former history teacher, I listened with great interest to the remarks from my colleague across the way.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576458" data-originallang="en"> I actually want to shift for a moment to what is happening domestically by virtue of what is happening overseas. I wonder if my colleague can comment on some of the trends we have seen here in Canada whereby, by virtue of the way one feels about the current government of the state of Israel, there have been substantial implications for Jews, such as me and those I represent, across Canada. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8576459" data-originallang="en">Can the member speak, for example, to some of the calls for boycotting of so-called Zionist businesses and how he believes this is a problem for us here in Canada as we try in our diaspora communities to deal with the impacts of what is happening overseas?</p>
