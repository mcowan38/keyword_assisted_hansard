<p data-HoCid="7957478" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, we agree that innocent civilian lives need to be protected, and that is why we have called for three things.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957479" data-originallang="en">First, we have called for the establishment of a safe zone in the southern part of the Gaza Strip to allow Gazans who are fleeing from the north, where a lot of the IDF is targeting Hamas infrastructure, to get to the south of the Gaza Strip in safety.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957480" data-originallang="en">Second, we are calling for a humanitarian corridor to allow for food, water and medical supplies from outside the Gaza Strip to enter the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957481" data-originallang="en">Third, we are calling for a humanitarian corridor to evacuate foreign nationals who are in Gaza, particularly Canadian citizens, who are trapped there.</p>
