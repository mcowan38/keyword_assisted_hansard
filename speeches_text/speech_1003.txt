<p data-HoCid="6716680" data-originallang="en">Well, it has been 16 years since the fraud was uncovered. Most of us have tried to move on with our lives. A number of our victims passed away. Because in our investment you had to have at least $50,000 to invest, most of the investors were people in their fifties and up. We've lost quite a few. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6716681" data-originallang="en">I've heard incredible stories. One was a man who survived Japanese prison camp and was married to a Holocaust survivor, an incredible man. The people I've met along the way have been so kind, so helpful and so grateful for what I do in keeping them informed or having kept them informed. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6716682" data-originallang="en">There was a well-known singer in Quebec who kept his story private for a long time, until we had a meeting. He met a number of the other victims and he realized that these were ordinary people. They were businessmen, doctors, lawyers, dentists and professionals who were victimized the same as he was, so he told his story publicly.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6716683" data-originallang="en">We did everything right. All our financial representatives were registered with the AMF. They were all in these professional associations. Mount Real was listed on the stock exchange. There was nothing to suggest that this company was an enormous Ponzi scheme until it was too late.</p>
