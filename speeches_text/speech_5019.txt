<p data-HoCid="8595083" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, today marks the first extremely dark anniversary of October 7, 2023, when terrorists carried out the worst attack on Jews since the Holocaust.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8595084" data-originallang="en">After consultation with parties, if you seek it, you will find unanimous consent for the following motion. I move:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8595085" data-originallang="en"> That the House: </p>
<p data-HoCid="8595086" data-originallang="en"> Unequivocally reaffirms Israel's right to defend itself from terrorists who attack it, </p>
<p data-HoCid="8595087" data-originallang="en"> Expresses support for the victims of the October 7th attack, their families and the people of Israel, </p>
<p data-HoCid="8595088" data-originallang="en"> Calls for the immediate release of the 101 hostages still being held captive, </p>
<p data-HoCid="8595089" data-originallang="en"> Condemns the grotesque rise in antisemitism and hate towards Jews in Canada over the past year, and </p>
<p data-HoCid="8595090" data-originallang="en"> Condemns Hamas and Hezbollah as terrorist entities which must be eliminated. </p>
