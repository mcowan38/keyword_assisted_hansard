<p data-HoCid="7959389" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I rise in this House to condemn the attacks conducted by Hamas on October 7 and I call on Hamas to release and safely return the Israeli hostages to their loved ones. I condemn the air strike on the Al Ahli Hospital yesterday. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7959390" data-originallang="en">What we are witnessing in Gaza is a humanitarian catastrophe. Over one million people have now been displaced, 3,000 have been killed and a third of them are children. I implore us to exhaust all tools that will allow humanitarian corridors to open for humanitarian aid to reach Palestinians. Now, more than ever, we need governments to work together to de-escalate the situation in Gaza and ensure the safety of innocent civilians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7959391" data-originallang="en"> My deepest condolences go out to every single person who has lost a loved one on either side of this conflict. Jewish and Palestinian communities are looking for leadership to see their humanity. That is our job as leaders.</p>
