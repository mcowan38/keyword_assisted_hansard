<p data-HoCid="8130484" data-originallang="en">This is a bit baffling. I'm going to be honest; it's a little bit insulting for people to be watching, because the stats.... Things have gotten worse, significantly worse. As I said to the minister earlier, there's a 79% increase in violence against women. There's crime and chaos. You're saying you have hundreds of millions more dollars, but everything is worse. People who are watching at home are saying, “They're spending almost $600,000 to pay people to hand out money. Where's the money going?” </p>
<p data-HoCid="8130485" data-originallang="en">We've seen this. I don't want this to be.... I know you're doing your job. I get that, but as a member of Parliament elected to elevate the people's voices.... We are in a cost of living crisis, where inflation is driving up the cost of living. The more you spend that is not spent efficiently, the more the cost of everything goes up. We've created a rabbit hole. The more money we give you, the more you need, because it's not doing what is expected. You've just told us that you've gotten hundreds of millions more dollars and you need more people to decide where that goes, yet we have a 79% increase in violence against women. We are the status of women committee. If the economy is not working, nothing works. </p>
