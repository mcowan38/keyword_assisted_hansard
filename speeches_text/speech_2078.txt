<p data-HoCid="7573247" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7573248" data-originallang="en">First of all, I would like to thank the Government of Canada, the Parliament of Canada and the people of Canada for standing with the Afghan people in this very difficult time and for allocating humanitarian visas and life-saving support for Afghans at risk.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7573249" data-originallang="en">At the same time, I would also like to say that at the time we are talking, thousands of Afghans—mostly human rights defenders, civil society activists and journalists—were able to resettle in Canada and find a second home at a time when their homes and lives were being taken away by a terrorist group.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7573250" data-originallang="en">Since August 2021, when Afghanistan was handed over to the Taliban, hundreds of Afghan human rights defenders, members of civil society, human rights activists, civil rights activists, journalists, lawyers, entrepreneurs, sports personalities, musicians and public figures have been abducted, arrested, detained, tortured and threatened. Scores have been killed, injured or disappeared in violent attacks by the Taliban and their associates.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7573251" data-originallang="en">Peaceful protesters who only demand their fundamental rights to employment and education are abducted, tortured, raped, killed and disappeared. Some are unlawfully detained for months without any due process.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7573252" data-originallang="en">Freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly are now non-existent. Hundreds of media outlets—mostly women's media outlets—were shut across Afghanistan. The few that are still active are facing significant levels of restrictions by the Taliban. The Taliban controls the media, news and debates. People who are critical of the Taliban are being abducted, arrested, detained and tortured, and some are being disappeared to this day.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7573253" data-originallang="en">In the areas where armed resistance is happening against the Taliban, such as the Panjshir province or the Andarab district, civilians are harassed, arrested, tortured and executed in broad daylight. While the summary execution of prisoners of war is the norm within the Taliban, other atrocities such as land grabbing, enforced evictions and the enforced displacement of other ethnic groups, such as the Hazaras in Daikundi, and Tajiks and Uzbeks in the Takhar, Baghlan and Kunduz provinces are happening on a large scale. Of course, the negative impact of these violations is significant, particularly on women and girls.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7573254" data-originallang="en">While the Taliban's atrocities have no limit, their war against the women and girls of Afghanistan goes back to the 1990s, when they first ruled the country. Despite the Taliban's fake promises made during the Doha peace agreement in February 2020, the Taliban continue to ban Afghan women and girls from employment and education, and systematically violate their basic and fundamental rights.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7573255" data-originallang="en"> Millions of girls are now out of school. The hundreds of thousands of women civil servants who lost their jobs were forced to stay at home. Universities are shut for women students, and women are now even banned from working in NGOs and for humanitarian aid agencies.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7573256" data-originallang="en">Since the Taliban took control, poverty among women has significantly increased. Now we see more women beggars on the streets and more children doing labour. There are significant increases in forced marriages, child marriages and child trafficking.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7573257" data-originallang="en"> Meanwhile, from whatever humanitarian aid is provided to the Afghan people, the Taliban are taking a significant share. It goes to the Taliban soldiers, some of whom are involved in committing war crimes in Afghanistan now. Humanitarian aid is most particularly given to the soldiers who fight on the front line or in the places that are deemed challenging by the Taliban. This has been reported by several UN agencies and other aid agencies.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7573258" data-originallang="en">In the past 18 months, while Taliban soldiers and officials operate with blanket immunity from any crime they commit on a daily basis in Afghanistan and while the country is run in the absence of any legal framework and all laws have been abolished, Taliban leaders, including internationally sanctioned terrorists, are travelling by private jets to European capitals and around the world. They are receiving billions of dollars in the name of so-called humanitarian aid, which is used to feed Taliban soldiers who commit gross human rights violations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7573259" data-originallang="en">Before taking too much time, I would like to end my speech by giving some recommendations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7573260" data-originallang="en"> While we are extremely thankful to the government and Parliament of Canada for their generous support of Afghans at risk, access to the process of resettlement in Canada is extremely slow and time-consuming. I therefore request that you please accelerate the resettlement process of Afghans at risk by allocating more personnel and resources to provide a speedy and timely response to the growing needs of Afghans at risk.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7573261" data-originallang="en">Please provide certain organizations such as Front Line Defenders, Freedom House, the Committee to Protect Journalists, the International Bar Association and others with a quota of visas for human rights defenders, women's rights activists, women and men media workers and journalists and lawyers so that they can provide the support and protection needed to those who are genuinely at high risk. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7573262" data-originallang="en">At the same time, hundreds of other women protesters are living in fear of deportation in Pakistan and Iran without having any prospect for the future of resettlement to any other country.</p>
