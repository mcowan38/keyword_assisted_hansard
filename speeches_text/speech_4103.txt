<p data-HoCid="8392835" data-originallang="en">One thing New Democrats have done recently was our motion on Palestine, which included ending military exports to Israel. Of course, many Canadian civil organizations have tried to track and report on Canada's arms export and trade regime. A lot of what we export goes towards Israel's space program. Have you—and I think I'll take that to Mr. Greenley and Ms. Beck—received anything from the government in terms of what the government promised, that the House would issue the notice to exporters and the ending of those exports? If you have any indication, received any communications from government or have any connection with that, I'm just curious about progress on that motion.</p>
