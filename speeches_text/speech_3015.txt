<p data-HoCid="8030891" data-originallang="en">Yes. Maybe there are two things that I can say here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8030892" data-originallang="en"> We continue to help IRCC in the vetting process of Afghans who are applying to come to Canada. That work has continued since the crisis started in August 2021. We continue to be available to Global Affairs Canada and IRCC for any other support they require in bringing Afghans home. That's the first aspect of it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8030893" data-originallang="en">A part of the recommendations in the report is to increase interdepartmental coordination, and I can assure you, Mr. Chair, and the member, that this has been demonstrated numerous times since that unfortunate crisis occurred in 2021. We had Sudan last year, obviously, and right now you have seen over the last few weeks the work we have done in Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8030894" data-originallang="en">Any time a hot spot or crisis starts that has a Canadian interest, on the same day or the next day there's an interdepartmental call that happens within hours at the deputy minister level and the ADM level to start looking into that crisis.</p>
