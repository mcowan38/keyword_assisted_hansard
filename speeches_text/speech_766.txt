<p data-HoCid="6605131" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I agree with everything that I've heard from all members on all sides thus far at this committee. I think this is an important motion, and I'm happy to support it, but I think we also need to really heed the call from Mr. Chong to focus on the core issue here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6605132" data-originallang="en">The core issue is that the Government of China has retaliated against specific individuals as a form of recognition of their leadership on the issue of responding to the genocide of Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims in China. As the subcommittee heard, this is the largest mass detention of a minority community since the Holocaust, a genocide that involves putting people in concentration camps, that involves forced sterilization, forced abortion, forced insertion of IUDs, systematic sexual violence and organ harvesting. It is that reality that compelled parliamentarians to respond at the time of the initial subcommittee study and statement, and led most members of Parliament to be present and to vote in favour of the resolution put forward by Mr. Chong recognizing that genocide. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6605133" data-originallang="en">That leadership by the subcommittee as well as by Mr. Chong with his motion, recognized in some formal sense by the Communist party, has had ripple effects around the world. We see conversations about these issues happening in other parliaments as well, and those conversations will, hopefully, increase and create greater pressure on those who are perpetrating this genocide to stop the violence now. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6605134" data-originallang="en">There is so much more work needed on the Canadian side in terms of response and leadership, and those issues are, I think, well detailed in the report from the subcommittee that we have passed along and tabled just recently. That report calls for significant strengthening of supply chain measures. It calls for Magnitsky sanctions against those responsible for this genocide. It calls for appropriate immigration measures addressing the significant vulnerability of Uighur refugees in other countries. Of course, it's difficult for those in East Turkestan to get out, but there are refugee communities in other parts of the world that are vulnerable as a result of Chinese government pressure. There are many issues on which we need to see concrete government and policy responses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6605135" data-originallang="en">To start with, I'd like to see the government recognize this genocide and join with parliamentarians of all parties and join with the direction and leadership that's been proposed by my colleague Mr. Chong. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6605136" data-originallang="en">What these sanctions show us is that the pressure of the leadership by the subcommittee and by Mr. Chong is working, is having an impact [<em>Technical difficulty—Editor</em>], not just being sloughed off as not a big deal. Those criticisms are having an impact, and the greater that impact, the more likely we're going to see a change in behaviour.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6605137" data-originallang="en">I want to congratulate Mr. Chong for his leadership on this, as well as the members of the subcommittee, and colleagues around the world who have been involved in these issues that have, in a sense, been recognized as well by the Communist party in the form of these sanctions. This just underlines how we need to continue to be strong voices for the voiceless, because whatever consequences these sanctions may cause for us as parliamentarians, they are absolutely nothing in comparison to the horrific violence being inflicted on people in China, on the Uighur people as well as on others throughout China who speak out and object and who challenge [<em>Technical difficulty—Editor</em>] taking place.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6605138" data-originallang="en">We should and we can, I think, draw our strength from those people and commit ourselves to continuing in this critical fight for justice. I encourage the government, on the concrete policy areas of genocide recognition, of strengthening supply chain legislation and on other areas that are so needed, to take leadership as well and to join with parliamentarians in this critical fight.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6605139" data-originallang="en">Thank you. </p>
