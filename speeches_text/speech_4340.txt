<p data-HoCid="8455310" data-originallang="fr">Good morning, everyone.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455311" data-originallang="fr">I call today's meeting to order.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455312" data-originallang="en"> Welcome to meeting number 106 of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455313" data-originallang="en">Pursuant to Standing Order 108(2) and the motion adopted by the committee on March 21, 2024, the committee is continuing its study on anti-Semitism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455314" data-originallang="en">Before we begin, I'd like to remind all members and other meeting participants in the room of some important preventative measures. To prevent disruptive and potentially harmful audio feedback incidents that can cause injuries, all in-person participants are reminded to keep their earpieces away from all microphones at all times.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455315" data-originallang="en">As indicated in the communiqu√© from the Speaker to all members on Monday, April 29, measures have been taken to help prevent audio feedback incidents. All earpieces have been replaced. Please only use the black approved earpiece. All unused earpieces should be unplugged at the start of the meeting if you're not using them. When you're not using an earpiece, please place it face down on the middle of the sticker. Please consult the cards on the table for guidelines to prevent audio feedback incidents.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455316" data-originallang="en">These measures are in place so that we can conduct our business without interruption and to protect the health and safety of all participants, including the interpreters.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455317" data-originallang="fr">I thank you in advance for your co-operation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455318" data-originallang="en">Today's meeting is taking place in a hybrid format.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455319" data-originallang="fr">I would like to inform you that all the sound checks have been done.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455320" data-originallang="en">I realize there's a camera not working, but all the sound tests have been completed. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8455321" data-originallang="en">I want to make a few comments for the benefit of members and the witnesses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455322" data-originallang="en">One, please wait until I recognize you by name before speaking. Two, I remind you that all comments should be addressed through the chair. For the benefit of all attending and viewing the webcast, I remind you that all briefs can be sent to the committee until May 27, 2024, and they should not exceed three pages in total.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455323" data-originallang="en">I now want to welcome our witnesses for the first session.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455324" data-originallang="en">As an individual, we have Mr. Mark Sandler. Representing Secure Canada, we have Madam Sheryl Saperia, chief executive officer, by video conference. Representing Universities Canada, in person we welcome Mr. Gabriel Miller, president and chief executive officer. Representing the Toronto Police Service, by video conference we have Deputy Chief Robert Johnson and acting Detective Sergeant Kiran Bisla.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455325" data-originallang="en">Each of the four witnesses will have five minutes for opening remarks, after which we will proceed with the round of questions. I will indicate by raising the card that there are only 30 seconds left. If you don't see it, I will probably end up needing to interrupt you when the time is up, and I will be fair with all witnesses alike, and all members, of course.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455326" data-originallang="en">With that, we will commence, and I will ask Madam Gladu to please start with six minutes.</p>
