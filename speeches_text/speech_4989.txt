<p data-HoCid="8598098" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, in March of this year, Samidoun paraded through my riding to intimidate our Jewish community. Now we see videos of Samidoun members in our streets calling for the death of Canada, shouting “Long live October 7” and calling Hamas terrorists their heroes while they burn the Canadian flag. The government has done nothing to put a stop to these pro-genocide, anti-Semitic, anti-Canadian mobs who threaten our Jewish communities nationwide. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8598099" data-originallang="en">Will the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> commit to protecting our Jewish communities and label Samidoun a terrorist organization?</p>
