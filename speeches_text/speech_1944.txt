<p data-HoCid="7404714" data-originallang="en"> Thank you for answering my question. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7404715" data-originallang="en">For my next question, I just want to share with you that in the House today there was a historic moment when in our parties all supported <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Madame Gazan</a>'s motion to acknowledge that what happened in residential schools were acts of genocide.
