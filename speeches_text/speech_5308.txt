<p data-HoCid="8693834" data-originallang="en"> I think the most significant achievement of the Oslo accords was to underline the legitimate rights and national aspirations of both peoples for mutual recognition. The most damaging development in recent years has been the reversal of that mutual recognition.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693835" data-originallang="en">Recently, a poll showed—a survey in Israel—that now only around 30% of Israelis recognize the Palestinian right to statehood. A lot of what was achieved at Oslo, and particularly that recognition, has been undermined and reversed over the years.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693836" data-originallang="en">The one surviving remnant of the Oslo accords is the Palestinian Authority, and that won't last forever. In order to save the Palestinian Authority, which was meant to be the way station toward a Palestinian state, I think it's important to take action, because otherwise the Palestinian Authority has no raison d'être. There's no reason for the Palestinian Authority to survive in the eyes of Palestinians if it isn't on a pathway towards statehood.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693837" data-originallang="en">In a sense, that is the last part of the Oslo accords left standing, and that's what needs to be saved.</p>
