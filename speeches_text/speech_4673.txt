<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I am rising on a question of privilege. I have a concern. As you were giving us the ruling today, we noticed on Twitter that the ruling was already published. The idea that members of this House should get that ruling before anyone else is quite clear and the fact that Twitter got the ruling before the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> or any of the members of this House is inappropriate.</p>
