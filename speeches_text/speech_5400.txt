<p data-HoCid="8703318" data-originallang="fr">Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703319" data-originallang="fr">Canadians are watching this war, this tragedy, and they want to see their government stand up for peace and human dignity. That's quite clear. That's what I hear in my community. It is very difficult for Canadians to understand how we can move forward with a two-state situation when one of the two states is not recognized. Some people seem to be in a quandary. On the one hand, Palestine cannot fully function as a state without being recognized, and on the other hand, it cannot be recognized without demonstrating that it functions as a state. It's a bit of a chicken and egg situation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703320" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Awad, could Canada's recognition of the Palestinian state strengthen Canada's position as a promoter of human rights and the peaceful resolution of conflicts? This would bring Canada in line with its more traditional role as a mediator in international conflicts.</p>
