<p data-HoCid="7732916" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, I just want to thank the hon. member. I do not know how she is standing here tonight as an indigenous woman listening to the debate, answering questions and not getting emotional like I am.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7732917" data-originallang="en">We have talked many times about the fact that I am a white woman and that if I went missing, people would look for me and my family would be listened to. In the case of the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>, she does not live with that privilege, and that is a deep flaw in our country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7732918" data-originallang="en">I know the <a data-HoCid="278903" href="/politicians/bill-blair/" title="Bill Blair">Minister of Emergency Preparedness</a> and I have agreed to go to Winnipeg, and the member has agreed to organize a meeting with advocates, survivors and families so that we can ensure they are at the centre of this. We also know that implementing the red dress alert requires the provinces and territories to be part of it, because they are the ones that actually implement the alerts, but she is absolutely right that it takes political will, and with her advocacy and with support from those in the government, I am confident we can get this done and we must get this done.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7732919" data-originallang="en">I just want to thank the member for being such a strong, fierce and incredible woman.</p>
