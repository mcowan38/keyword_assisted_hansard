<p data-HoCid="8168741" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, this gives me an opportunity to talk about the announcement we made today to deal precisely with this issue. There is $40 million, additional, to deliver life-saving food, medicine and other supplies to Palestinians through trusted international partners, including the World Health Organization, the World Food Programme, UNICEF and many others. We have always centred our decisions around the protection of innocent civilians in Gaza, and through this allocation, we have upped our game to $100 million in humanitarian assistance to Palestinians.</p>
