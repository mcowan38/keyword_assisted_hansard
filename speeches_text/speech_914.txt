<p data-HoCid="6655579" data-originallang="fr">Okay, thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6655580" data-originallang="fr">I am speaking to you today from the traditional territory of the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation. I wish to honour the waters they paddled and their moccasins which walked these lands.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6655581" data-originallang="fr">It is my pleasure to appear at this committee to discuss Bill <a data-HoCid="11007812" href="/bills/43-2/C-15/" title="An Act respecting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">C-15</a>. I am joined today by two officials from the Implementation Sector: Ross Pattee, Assistant Deputy Minister, and Marla Israel, Director General of the Policy, Planning and Coordination Branch.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6655582" data-originallang="fr">I would also like to take this opportunity to recognize the leadership of former member of Parliament Romeo Saganash on developing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (the “Declaration”) and on legislating a framework to implement it here in Canada and I thank him for Bill <a data-HoCid="8160636" href="/bills/42-1/C-262/" title="An Act to ensure that the laws of Canada are in harmony with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">C-262</a>, which served as the foundation for Bill <a data-HoCid="11007812" href="/bills/43-2/C-15/" title="An Act respecting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">C-15</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6655583" data-originallang="en"> The declaration is of critical importance to indigenous peoples across Canada, including the indigenous leaders who participated directly in its development.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6655584" data-originallang="en">The declaration is the result of decades of tireless effort, negotiations and sustained advocacy within the United Nations system, including by inspiring indigenous leaders like Dr. Wilton Littlechild, who you heard from last week. As Dr. Littlechild recently told me, all together, <a data-HoCid="11007812" href="/bills/43-2/C-15/" title="An Act respecting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">C-15</a> is a reconciliation call for justice and respect through implementation of solutions-based international treaties.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6655585" data-originallang="en">I believe that implementing the declaration here in Canada is essential to advancing reconciliation with indigenous peoples. This has been made clear by both the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, after six years of hearings, and the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, after three years of listening to families and survivors.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6655586" data-originallang="en">The TRC said that the declaration charts a path for reconciliation to flourish in 21st century Canada. The inquiry's calls for justice also call on governments to immediately implement and fully comply with the declaration.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6655587" data-originallang="en">The introduction of <a data-HoCid="11007812" href="/bills/43-2/C-15/" title="An Act respecting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">C-15</a> fulfills our government's commitment to introduce legislation to implement the declaration, establishing Bill <a data-HoCid="8160636" href="/bills/42-1/C-262/" title="An Act to ensure that the laws of Canada are in harmony with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">C-262</a> as the floor, rather than the ceiling.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6655588" data-originallang="en">Prior to the bill's introduction, 33 bilateral sessions took place with AFN, ITK and MNC. In addition, more than 450 people participated in 28 regional engagement sessions, providing feedback and advice on potential enhancements to the consultation draft. Provincial and territorial governments, experts and industry stakeholders also informed the development of the bill.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6655589" data-originallang="en">While we acknowledge that some would have preferred a longer engagement, it was inclusive and meaningful. The current bill reflects the content requested by many indigenous partners.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6655590" data-originallang="en">Extensive meetings were also held with indigenous partners and other stakeholders after its introduction, to explain the bill's content and work on further enhancements. As <a data-HoCid="245291" href="/politicians/david-lametti/" title="David Lametti">Minister Lametti</a> has noted, engagement post introduction informed some further amendments, which the government will be supporting.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6655591" data-originallang="en">Co-development of the action plan will be a further opportunity to work in close partnership on implementation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6655592" data-originallang="en">We have already begun preliminary discussions with indigenous partners on the design of that process. Yesterday's budget 2021 proposes to provide $31.5 million over two years to support its co-development.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6655593" data-originallang="en">Recognizing and respecting indigenous rights mean that indigenous peoples are at the table for decisions that impact their rights. In many cases, it means that economic development and stronger economic outcomes will be advanced with indigenous peoples as partners.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6655594" data-originallang="en">The declaration is broader than economic development. I'm so grateful for my conversation with Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, who you also heard from last week, on her findings about racism in health care and her report, “In Plain Sight”. She was very clear about article 24 of the declaration, which states:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="6655595" data-originallang="en"> Indigenous individuals have an equal right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. States shall take the necessary steps with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of this right. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="6655596" data-originallang="en">This will be very important in guiding the future legislation on indigenous health.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6655597" data-originallang="en">I also remember how important it was, during the summit on child welfare, to underline Article 7 of the declaration, which details the collective and individual rights to live free from violence, including “forcibly removing children”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6655598" data-originallang="en">The declaration allows us all to develop a clear path so everyone can work together as partners with a shared stake in Canada's future.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6655599" data-originallang="en">As I said before, implementing the declaration is nothing to be frightened of. What is needed is fundamental and foundational change. It's about shedding our colonial past and writing the next chapter together, as partners with indigenous peoples.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6655600" data-originallang="en">It has been more than 13 years since the declaration was adopted by the General Assembly. I urge all members to support this fundamental and necessary change and support this bill.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6655601" data-originallang="en"> Thank you. <em>Meegwetch</em>. <em>Nakurmiik</em>. <em>Marsi</em>.</p>
