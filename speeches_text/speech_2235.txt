<p data-HoCid="7653797" data-originallang="en">Ms. Van De Bogart, one key thing that I think would be critical to solving the problem or crisis is data. I have first-hand witnesses in my community. Again, a young woman who was homeless was a victim of trafficking. She didn't get the media attention. Nobody really looked for her. Her mother fought tooth and nail. They were able to find her because of social media, but I don't even know that she would have been reported. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7653798" data-originallang="en">How do we close this gap in data? As my colleague Ms. Gazan said, the numbers aren't truly reflective of how big this is. How do we fix that?</p>
