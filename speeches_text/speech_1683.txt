<p data-HoCid="7129206" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, with respect to racism, misogyny, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, homophobia and transphobia, we are seeing a disturbing rise in all these toxic forms of hate in Canada as far-right extremists mobilize in our country. We see this manifested in despicable acts of hate and violence across the country. Canadians need to stand up and speak out against far-right extremism and hate. We do that by fighting hate in all its toxic forms.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7129207" data-originallang="en">We Canadians have our next opportunity to speak out next Tuesday, May 10, as the Stand with Asians Coalition and other important groups mark a day of action against increasing anti-Asian racism and hate. Cities representing over 15 million Canadians have already marked this day with proclamations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7129208" data-originallang="en">Some of the most fundamental freedoms are freedom from hate and freedom from fear. Let us all stand together for freedom from hate in Canada.</p>
