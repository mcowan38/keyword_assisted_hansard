<p data-HoCid="7976728" data-originallang="en">First of all, I'd like to deeply apologize to our witnesses who came here with good faith about a very serious issue regarding our future.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7976729" data-originallang="en">I'd also like to apologize to anybody out there who thinks that the Parliament of Canada would use the horrific kidnapping of hostages in Israel in order to promote the sale of oil and gas. I've seen a lot of reprehensible exploitation in my many years in Parliament, but I think that's probably one of the most lowdown ugly things that I've witnessed. When I see this attempt to use the horrific crimes that have been committed as a reason to promote oil and gas, I'm just ashamed to sit here, so I move to adjourn this debate.</p>
