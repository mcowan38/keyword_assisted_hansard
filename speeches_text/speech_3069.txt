<p data-HoCid="8048571" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I am here today to discuss Bill <a data-HoCid="12566934" href="/bills/44-1/C-355/" title="An Act to prohibit the export by air of horses for slaughter and to make related amendments to certain Acts">C-355</a>, a bill that prohibits the export by air of live horses for the purpose of being slaughtered or fattened for slaughter. It enacts new legislation prohibiting the export of live horses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8048572" data-originallang="fr">I will start by carefully explaining the four main reasons why the Bloc Québécois is opposed to the principle of the bill.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8048573" data-originallang="fr">First, the bill enacts new legislation, even though it is possible to change the current laws and regulations, in particular the Health of Animals Act, as well as its regulations. Also, it is inconceivable to us that animal welfare be restricted to just one type of animal, in this case equines. Canada and Quebec also export other types of live animals by various means of transportation. It would be worthwhile to consider the other types of transportation, including transportation by road, which is far more common and can also compromise animal welfare. Finally, amending the bill so as to raise standards for animal transportation would expand the scope of the bill and change the principle.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8048574" data-originallang="fr">For these reasons, we will vote against this bill at second reading. That said, we find that the bill is well-intended. Animal welfare is an important concern and principle for us all. Without healthy animals, our agriculture and agri-food industry would collapse. Canada and Quebec have laws in place, but there are gaps in the legislation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8048575" data-originallang="fr">We do not want our position to be interpreted as a desire to minimize or deny the facts that led to the introduction of this bill. On the contrary, we are well aware that Canada exports by air live horses to be slaughtered in conditions that, even if they comply with Canadian laws and regulations, are widely criticized. The Bloc Québécois is especially frustrated by the fact that the bill deals solely with horses, when regulations on animal welfare and transportation apply to all animals exported for slaughter. However, should the bill be passed at second reading and amended in committee, the Bloc Québécois remains open to working responsibly.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8048576" data-originallang="fr">In the former <a data-HoCid="300001" href="/politicians/marie-claude-bibeau/" title="Marie-Claude Bibeau">minister of agriculture and agri-food</a>'s 2021 mandate letter, the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> asked her to “Ban the live export of horses for slaughter.” It seems like Canada intends to ban this practice itself. Why has this not already been done?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8048577" data-originallang="fr">I will now address the fact that the CFIA, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, once had a page on its website dedicated to debunking myths about this industry. First, we have to distinguish between “horse meat” and “live horses”. Horse meat refers to animals slaughtered in Canada and meat being exported, not live animals. For many people, the consumption of horse meat is taboo. Having had horses myself when I was young, I am well aware of that. We have to respect that, but not at the expense of other animals. Abuse is abuse, regardless of the animal.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8048578" data-originallang="fr"> According to a survey conducted by Research Co. and Glacier Media in early 2021, only 27% of Canadians believe it is appropriate to eat horse meat, even though the percentage is much higher when it comes to meat from other animals. Rabbits and geese are regarded as appropriate food sources by nearly 60% of Canadians, and that number increases to 75% for beef, 79% for pork and 88% for poultry, such as chicken.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8048579" data-originallang="fr">One of the arguments presented by the sponsor of Bill <a data-HoCid="12555471" href="/bills/44-1/S-270/" title="An Act to amend the Health of Animals Act and the Agriculture and Agri-Food Administrative Monetary Penalties Regulations (live horses)">S-270</a>, which is similar to Bill C-355, is that horses played a unique role in Canada's history and in the building of the country, which means we could get into the whole issue of the Canadian horse. It is clear that horses are part of our history. Over 36,000 Canadians presented a petition to the House of Commons calling on the government to ban the export of live horses for slaughter. Two-thirds of Canadians are opposed to this practice. According to the same survey, nearly 85% of Canadians were not aware that Canada was engaging in this practice. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8048580" data-originallang="fr">In Quebec, the consumption of horse meat is more generally accepted. The government of Quebec has included additional protection in its legal framework for racehorses, horses from riding centres, rodeo horses, horses participating in performances or shows, and so on. During this process, animal welfare groups, in particular the Association québécoise de protection des chevaux, cited the Bloc Québécois’s comment on the special treatment of horses, affirming that “it is self-evident that horses should be treated the same as cats and dogs”, that the “government should not stop there” and that “all farm animals deserved the same consideration”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8048581" data-originallang="fr">The Bloc Québécois believes that banning export by air of just one species is illogical and inconsistent, and that the best way to move forward on animal welfare is to review handling and transportation standards.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8048582" data-originallang="fr">Quebec is the second-largest exporter of horse meat in the world, and 85% of our exports are sent to Japan. The United States claims to no longer slaughter horses for human consumption, but it exports its horses to Canada for that purpose. According to a CTV News report, we are talking about 120,000 animals between 2013 and 2018.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8048583" data-originallang="fr">Canada is a major exporter of livestock. It exports pigs, sheep, lambs, cattle and horses to various countries. However, the conditions can be inhumane for all animals that are exported. We should therefore ensure better conditions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8048584" data-originallang="fr">According to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, or CFIA, roughly 45,000 horses have been exported by air to Japan since 2013. That amounts to about 4,500 horses a year, maybe a few more, since animals are exported to countries besides Japan, even if Japan is by far the largest importer. However, every year, Canada also exports hundreds of thousands of other kinds of live animals to all corners of the world.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8048585" data-originallang="fr">We think it would be more appropriate to take action on export conditions to make them safer for animals. Specifically, this could mean reducing the number of hours animals must travel without water, food or rest; regulating the size and material of cages used for transportation, or even creating areas especially designed for these animals; and controlling the temperature and ambient noise, considering that horses have much more sensitive hearing than humans. Lastly, we could examine the effects of a general ban on exporting live animals for slaughter abroad. Some countries have already taken this step. These are just ways of broadening the debate. What we have here are other issues that could be raised.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8048586" data-originallang="fr"> The Canadian Horse Defence Coalition even sued the Government of Canada for failing to abide by animal welfare legislation when shipping horses via cargo plane.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8048587" data-originallang="fr"> The Farm Animal Welfare Education Center, which is associated with the Autonomous University of Barcelona's veterinary school, stated the following, and I quote: </p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8048588" data-originallang="fr"> Despite being a relatively short phase in the process of meat production, the transport of animals to slaughter can cause major economic losses. This is because during transport the animals are exposed to a variety of stressors in a short period of time....[which] in extreme cases can result in the death of the animals. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8048589" data-originallang="fr"> Stress during transport increases the susceptibility of animals to infections. What is more, “Truck design and the handling of animals have an important effect on the welfare of animals during transport.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8048590" data-originallang="fr">Many animals are similar to humans when it comes to stress. This is particularly true of swine, an oft-cited example. The Ontario Ministry of Agriculture published information on the precautions that should be taken when transporting swine.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8048591" data-originallang="fr">That might be worth looking at. It is difficult to believe that all of the guidelines for the export of live swine for slaughter that should be followed are being followed, so we still have a way to go.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8048592" data-originallang="fr">Finally, here is a some information taken directly from the CFIA website. I thought it would be interesting to read a few excerpts.</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8048593" data-originallang="fr"> Canadian provinces have the primary responsibility for protecting the welfare of animals, including farm animals and pets. All provinces and territories have laws in respect to animal welfare. Provincial and territorial legislation tend to be general in scope, covering a wide range of animal welfare interests. Some provinces and territories have regulations that govern specific aspects of animal welfare, or are related to certain species. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8048594" data-originallang="fr"> The CFIA's animal welfare mandate is limited to regulating humane transport of animals and the humane treatment of food animals in federal abattoirs. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8048595" data-originallang="fr">Moreover, the CFIA works “closely with the provinces, territories and all stakeholders in the animal care community when animal welfare issues are identified”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8048596" data-originallang="fr">The CFIA is also working with the industry to “establish standards of care and biosecurity”, to establish “the requirements to protect all animals during transport”, and to verify that “humane transport and humane slaughter requirements are respected in all federal slaughter plants”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8048597" data-originallang="fr">The Criminal Code also stipulates the following:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8048598" data-originallang="fr"> [The Criminal Code of Canada] prohibits anyone from willfully causing animals to suffer from neglect, pain or injury. The <em>Criminal Code</em> is enforced by police services, provincial and territorial Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and/or provincial and territorial ministries of agriculture. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8048599" data-originallang="fr">Quebec has five laws and regulations in place that already protect farm animals.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8048600" data-originallang="fr">In conclusion, even though I grew up with horses, I care about the welfare of all animals.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8048601" data-originallang="fr">We will see what happens with this bill. If it does go to committee, the Bloc Québécois will obviously be there to work responsibly. However, at this point, we think this bill needs far too much work.</p>
