<p data-HoCid="7963938" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, the Toronto police chief has reported a 132% increase in hate crimes. We have seen horrific stories of a sign written in spray paint in Centennial Park that says “Attack the Jew” or a vandalized message in London that says “Kill all Muslims”. This is absolutely unacceptable.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7963939" data-originallang="en">We can all be revolted by the horrors of Hamas, but we should never blame our fellow citizens in Canada who are Muslim. They did not commit those atrocities. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7963940" data-originallang="en">We can debate the decisions of the Israeli government, but we have no right to insult our Jewish neighbours or attack their local synagogue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7963941" data-originallang="en">This must be a country based on freedom, where it does not matter if one's name is Mohammed or Martin, Chang or Charles, Singh, Smith or Steinberg. We are all Canadians. We are all compatriots. Let us embrace each other with love.</p>
