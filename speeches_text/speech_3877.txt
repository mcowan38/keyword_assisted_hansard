<p data-HoCid="8309556" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8309557" data-originallang="en"> Good afternoon, members of the Standing Committee on the Status of Women.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8309558" data-originallang="en"> I am Hilda Anderson-Pyrz, chair of the National Family and Survivors Circle, a non-profit organization incorporated in April 2023, led by indigenous women and gender-diverse individuals who are impacted family members of missing and murdered indigenous women, girls and two-spirit and gender-diverse people, as well as survivors of gender- and race-based violence.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8309559" data-originallang="en">I respectfully recognize that our meeting today is taking place on the traditional unceded and unsurrendered territory of the Algonquin Anishinabe people.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8309560" data-originallang="en">Today, I stand with the MMIWG2S+ families, survivors and two-spirit and gender-diverse people whose resilience and advocacy have been critical in pushing forward the red dress alert initiative. I give my thanks to the federal government and MP Leah Gazan for their efforts toward the establishment and forthcoming implementation of the red dress alert. It is a reflection of decades of advocacy for transformative change and action.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8309561" data-originallang="en">The red dress alert is an essential tool for the protection of indigenous women, girls and two-spirit and gender-diverse people, representing a significant advancement in our response to the crisis. Our communities are confronted with the daily disappearances of indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people. It is not a reflection of choice but of a societal disregard for indigenous lives, making us targets for violence.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8309562" data-originallang="en">The urgency of these situations cannot be overstated. When an indigenous woman, girl or gender-diverse individual goes missing, immediate action is crucial in mobilizing information, resources and collaborative efforts to facilitate locating them safely.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8309563" data-originallang="en">The development and implementation of the red dress alert should be led by indigenous women and gender-diverse people and frontline indigenous organizations. Effective responses require listening to those directly affected, especially in remote areas like Nunavut, where limited connectivity poses additional challenges. Engagements in these communities are essential in gathering insights and guiding our actions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8309564" data-originallang="en"> The red dress alert, alongside comprehensive wraparound support services, aims to prevent and respond to these disappearances. These services must be rooted in indigenous ways of knowing, being and doing, and must be independent from political influence. It is critical that they uphold the fundamental human rights of indigenous women, girls and two-spirit and gender-diverse people in order for us to live with dignity and safety.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8309565" data-originallang="en">I call on all levels of government to support the red dress alert and its associated services, highlighting the need for prompt and impactful action, and investments in a dedicated alert system for the indigenous community.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8309566" data-originallang="en">In conclusion, I thank you for this opportunity. The implementation of the red dress alert is critical, not just as a policy measure but as a commitment to resolving the MMIWG2S+ national crisis without political obstruction. Our actions now can provide the opportunity for a secure, safer and more dignified future for indigenous women, girls and two-spirit and gender-diverse people.</p>
