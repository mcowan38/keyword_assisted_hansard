<p data-HoCid="7409901" data-originallang="fr">Okay. It will be after break week. <a data-HoCid="278916" href="/politicians/marci-ien/" title="Marci Ien">Minister Ien</a> is appearing on November 14. So we will start on November 17.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7409902" data-originallang="fr">That's perfect. That's what I wanted to clarify.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7409903" data-originallang="fr">I also agree that after this decision, we could continue our other study. After the mental health witness panel, we still have to finish the report on Ms. Gazan's study. We'll have to see how that affects the review timeline for the study on Indigenous women.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7409904" data-originallang="fr">Can we get a clarification on that?</p>
