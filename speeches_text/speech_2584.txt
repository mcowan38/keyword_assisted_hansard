<p data-HoCid="7964500" data-originallang="en"> Thanks, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7964501" data-originallang="en">Thanks to the Auditor General for being with us today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7964502" data-originallang="en"> I also want to join my colleagues in sending condolences to those many victims in Palestine and Israel right now who are terrified for their lives. I'm sure we'll be addressing this much more in Parliament next week.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7964503" data-originallang="en">Auditor General, I have a question about procedure and history. I hope you can indulge me to better understand. In some ways, you already gave reference to the fact that your office is independent and, because of that independence, it operates in a particular way in order to preserve its integrity.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7964504" data-originallang="en">Particularly when it comes to issues that are currently being studied, have you or has any other Auditor General, to your knowledge, ever been summoned to the public accounts committee in connection with an audit that you are currently conducting?</p>
