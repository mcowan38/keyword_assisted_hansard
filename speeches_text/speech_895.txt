<p data-HoCid="6649262" data-originallang="en"> I understand, Mr. Viersen, but we've had the bill for weeks, if not months. I would think that if amendments have not been brought forward in the timeline that was prescribed, I'm not sure I'd like to admit further ones.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6649263" data-originallang="en">As the chair, I'm wondering why we need to go line by line over a document that we've had for so long, considered amendments for and for which we've had the amendments in our files. I'm open to any discussion by the committee on that, but I'm reluctant to slow everything. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6649264" data-originallang="en">Believe me, the first thing I think I may have referred to is that we want to be careful that we do this properly so that our work is correct at the finish. If we need to go line by line, then I've got to add more papers to a very terrible-looking desk. I don't mind doing that if it's in the best interests of the work we're doing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6649265" data-originallang="en">Ms. Gazan, you have your hand up.</p>
