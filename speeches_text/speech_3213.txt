<p data-HoCid="8114746" data-originallang="fr">Thank you very much, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8114747" data-originallang="fr">Minister, thank you for joining us today. We hope you will come back often.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8114748" data-originallang="fr">I'm going to ask you three questions. I would like brief answers, please.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8114749" data-originallang="en">First off, Laith Marouf, who was providing the most vile expressions of anti-Semitism and hate, was given a contract through Canadian Heritage. The NDP was the first party to call for the cancellation of that contract, and the government cancelled the contract. However, I want to know whether the money has been paid back—around $125,000—and what steps have been taken within Canadian Heritage to ensure that those who promote hate in any form will no longer get contracts through the government.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8114750" data-originallang="en">Secondly, on Meta, in testimony before this committee just this week, the Center for Countering Digital Hate stated very clearly, and its studies have shown us, that Meta, in its algorithms, is promoting the most vile anti-Semitism. Meta is not only refusing to respect Canadian democracy with Bill <a data-HoCid="11668222" href="/bills/44-1/C-18/" title="An Act respecting online communications platforms that make news content available to persons in Canada">C-18</a>, but has also been cited numerous times for that expression of vile anti-Semitism and other forms of hate. However, we provide subsidies to Meta and Google, according to the Library of Parliament, that are in the order of more than $1 billion every year. That is in the advertising tax credit as an indirect subsidy for Meta.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8114751" data-originallang="en">Why do we continue to subsidize Meta when it is not respecting Canadian democracy and when it has been implicated in the most vile expressions, through its algorithms, of anti-Semitic hate, Islamophobic hate, racism, misogyny, and homophobic and transphobic hate?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8114752" data-originallang="fr">My final question concerns the agreement with Google.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8114753" data-originallang="fr">We know that, with a crisis hitting news media across the country—we saw what happened at TVA—we need the web giants to contribute to our society and to the dissemination of news.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8114754" data-originallang="fr">Google is also receiving this subsidy. Given that there is a shortfall between what the government was seeking and what we are receiving under this agreement, are you considering taking the subsidy away from Google? It represents $1 billion for Meta and Google combined, according to the Library of Parliament. The government could give that money to the media, whose job it is to provide news and inform Canadians about what is happening in their communities.</p>
