<p data-HoCid="6791938" data-originallang="en">Going back to the elections issue, I'm wondering if it's fair to say that Canada has done two things: called upon the Palestinian Authority to have elections as soon as possible, and called upon Israel to ensure that all who voted the last time could vote this time. Is that fair to say?</p>
