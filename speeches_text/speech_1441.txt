<p data-HoCid="7048408" data-originallang="fr">The vaccination situation in the world is totally inequitable. In the more affluent countries, the European countries, Australia, Israel, Canada and the United States, the population is overwhelmingly vaccinated because the vaccines are accessible. The unvaccinated are those who are difficult to reach for all sorts of reasons that other witnesses have already mentioned, or they are people who simply do not want to be vaccinated.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7048409" data-originallang="fr">In the poorest or lower-middle income countries, the situation is different. According to the latest figures we have obtained, just 4% of the population in these countries in total have had access to vaccines and may be adequately vaccinated. We are talking about two doses of vaccine here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7048410" data-originallang="fr">As I said earlier, even if vaccines were available locally, it would be difficult to vaccinate remote populations in Africa because of the heat. The reluctance that we see here, we see elsewhere. The longer it takes to vaccinate people in low-income countries, the more reluctant they will be to take the vaccine. There is really work to be done on this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7048411" data-originallang="fr">That being said, the more protected we feel here, the more we forget about the rest of the world and the more we forget that we are interconnected. Until there is vaccine equity or access to treatment for all—of course, I'm not just talking about vaccines—the virus will continue to circulate and come back in waves continuously for many years. Let's hope, however, that someday this will end.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7048412" data-originallang="fr">That is the status of the vaccine situation around the world.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7048413" data-originallang="fr">Could you repeat your second question?</p>
