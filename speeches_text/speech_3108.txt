<p data-HoCid="8065917" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, last week, I was in Israel to show solidarity with our friend and ally. I will never forget seeing burned and shot-up homes where ordinary people had their lives stolen by barbaric terrorists. One man told me that while he hid with his daughters, Hamas terrorists murdered his parents. A mother told me about her daughter being abducted and the anguish of not knowing her fate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8065918" data-originallang="en">Here at home, another battle is raging. Canadians are shocked by public displays of anti-Semitism across the country. I am appalled at seeing people tear down posters of hostages. What kind of person tears down a poster of a kidnapped baby?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8065919" data-originallang="en">There is no place in Canada for targeting Jewish-owned businesses or for shooting up Jewish schools. There is no place for Jewish students to feel unsafe because of who they are. There is no place for anti-Semitism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8065920" data-originallang="en">I call on all members of the House to show solidarity with our friend, the only democracy in the Middle East, the state of Israel. Only when Hamas is defeated can peace be within reach.</p>
