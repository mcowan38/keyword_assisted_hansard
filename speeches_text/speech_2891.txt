<p data-HoCid="7999936" data-originallang="en">If Iran is a major culprit in what's going on in the Middle East and is providing arms for Russia—I think that's fairly well proven too—the money that's made from the oil being shipped out of Iran is actually being used against Ukraine and is being used against Israel at this point in time. Is that fair to say?</p>
