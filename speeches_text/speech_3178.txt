<p data-HoCid="8090861" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, this weekend, violence between Israel and Hamas resumed. More Palestinian children and humanitarian workers have been killed in Netanyahu's bombardment, and there are still many people being held hostage by Hamas. Doctors Without Borders convoys in Gaza were attacked and destroyed, and aid trucks have been blocked. This is not eliminating Hamas; this is destroying an entire population, yet the Liberals and the Conservatives refuse to call for a ceasefire.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8090862" data-originallang="en">Why is the government's position so cowardly in the face of this humanitarian disaster?</p>
