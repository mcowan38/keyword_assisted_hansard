<p data-HoCid="8750108" data-originallang="en"> Ms. Mathyssen, I take your point and the objective you hope to achieve here. I'm going to ask if we can save that for the end of the meeting, once we've utilized the time with the witnesses before us, in order to not find ourselves in the same situation. I will absolutely take the question back, have a discussion and commit to you that we'll find an opportunity to raise it. I just worry that if we start engaging in this conversation now, we're going to find ourselves in exactly the same position and down a rabbit hole.</p>
