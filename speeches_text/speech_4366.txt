<p data-HoCid="8455431" data-originallang="en">One is obviously in the purview of the province, given that they're responsible for policing. The other three might be appropriate within this forum.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455432" data-originallang="en">First, create dedicated hate crime units mandating a hate crime course for investigators and culturally sensitive training. This will provide service members with the foundational knowledge of the practice of religions such as Judaism and Islam, as well as enhanced understanding of the community impact of hate crimes, and it will ensure a consistent investigative approach.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455433" data-originallang="en">Second, adopt a standardized definition of “hate crime”. Conducting community consultations to better understand the definition and controversial slogans is recommended. We know from speaking with the community and our officers that there is a sense of frustration around the lack of clarity as to what constitutes a hate incident as opposed to a hate crime or hate propaganda. A commitment to ongoing education and training for our officers will assist the public and the police in this regard.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455434" data-originallang="en">Third, remove AG consent as a prerequisite for laying hate crime charges. The rationale is to unleash the power of the common law to evolve the rules around acceptable speech and conduct. Also, banning certain flags or symbols should be considered.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455435" data-originallang="en">Fourth, the list of banned organizations, as they fund terror and hate, should be updated as many new groups have surfaced since October 7.</p>
