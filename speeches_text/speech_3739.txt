<p data-HoCid="8300190" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300191" data-originallang="en">I promise to behave.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300192" data-originallang="fr">Let me begin by acknowledging that we are meeting today on the traditional, unceded territories of the Algonquin Anishinabe people.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300193" data-originallang="fr">Thank you for inviting me to discuss measures my department launched in response to the crises in Sudan and Gaza.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300194" data-originallang="en">The situations in Sudan and Gaza are devastating and have left Canadians anxious to bring their loved ones to safety. It's also not lost on me that the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza continues through Ramadan, a holy time meant to be cherished with family and friends.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300195" data-originallang="en">After fighting broke out in Sudan last spring, my department responded by supporting the assisted departure of Canadian citizens, permanent residents, locally engaged staff and their families.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300196" data-originallang="fr">Despite challenges keeping Canada’s embassy and Visa Application Centre in Sudan running, we’re continuing to process applications from Sudan through our global network.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300197" data-originallang="fr">We’ve prioritized applications for temporary and permanent residence, including refugee applications. We also waived most fees for Canadians and permanent residents who need replacement documents and other assistance to leave Sudan.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300198" data-originallang="fr">Sudanese nationals who want to stay in Canada during the conflict can apply to change or extend their temporary resident status, free of charge through October.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300199" data-originallang="en"> Recently, we also launched a humanitarian pathway to permanent residence for people living in Sudan, where the conflict began, including non-Sudanese nationals. Their Canadian family will support them here and help them integrate, with the assistance of our settlement services.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300200" data-originallang="en">Every crisis requires a tailored and different response, and the situation in Gaza calls for Canada to respond in ways that meet the unique demands of those on the ground seeking refuge.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300201" data-originallang="fr">We’ve prioritized permanent resident applications from the region within most family-based streams. And for Israelis and Palestinians in Canada who feel unsafe returning, we’ve waived fees to change or extend their temporary resident status, including applying for study and open work permits.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300202" data-originallang="en">Many Canadians remain, understandably, deeply worried for their extended family in Gaza. In January, we launched measures to offer them a temporary safe haven here. Family members holding Palestinian passports can apply for temporary resident visas, and their Canadian family will support them for a year once they arrive. They'll also have access to interim federal health coverage and, obviously, federal settlement services.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300203" data-originallang="en">The policy has, up to now, been currently accepting 1,000 applications into processing, and as we monitor the situation, we're evaluating the needs to update that response and to increase the application of people who are covered by our measures. I do not have a specific additional number to offer the committee today, but members should be aware that our teams are working on it. In the past couple of weeks, we have started to increase the number of codes being issued to people seeking to exit Gaza. We can get into this in the question and answer period.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300204" data-originallang="en">Usually, applicants need to submit fingerprints and a photo before they can be moved out of a country. However, since my department has no presence in Gaza to collect biometrics, applicants provide enhanced biographic information on their forms. This allows us to do preliminary security screening while they're still in Gaza so that we can finalize their applications faster once they leave. Biometrics are then collected in Cairo.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300205" data-originallang="en">This is standard practice in crises where we have no presence on the ground. This is something we used in Afghanistan as well.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300206" data-originallang="fr">We’ve heard concerns about the form, so we’ve altered or removed some questions. And since we know applicants may not have access to all the required documents, I’ve directed my department and officers to be flexible and assess each situation case-by-case.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300207" data-originallang="en">As you're aware, movement out of Gaza remains limited and out of Canada's control. Though I'm frustrated by this, I can only imagine the desperation families in Canada must feel as they wait for their loved ones to come. I know many are gathered here physically today and are feeling that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300208" data-originallang="en">We are also working with local authorities at every level to make sure people's names who we've submitted are approved to exit Gaza. We'll leave no stone unturned in our campaign to have families safely reunited with their families in Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300209" data-originallang="fr">Thank you very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300210" data-originallang="fr">I'll be happy to answer your questions.</p>
