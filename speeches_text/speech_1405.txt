<p data-HoCid="6965473" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my hon. colleague and friend for the question. He and I attended high school together.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6965474" data-originallang="en">This is an opportunity to remember the six million Jews who perished in the Holocaust, along with the Roma and Sinti, and countless other victims of its unprecedented horror. We can never forget the systemic extermination and genocide during the Nazi regime. Today, we must also recognize that the world is witnessing an alarming increase in anti-Semitism, Holocaust denial, xenophobia and hate. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6965475" data-originallang="en">We must pledge to always be vigilant, to stand against the Nazi swastika and other symbols of hate, and to uphold human rights and dignity for all. We must refute those who seek to distort facts and commit to educating new generations, upholding the truth, embracing equality and protecting the rights of the most vulnerable.</p>
