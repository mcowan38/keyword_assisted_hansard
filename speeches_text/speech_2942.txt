<p data-HoCid="7989250" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7989251" data-originallang="fr">I thank Ms. Ferreri for moving this motion. Violence against women is certainly a problem. We all agree on that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7989252" data-originallang="fr">Clearly, there are several crises at the moment. One of the reasons we added the sports study to the agenda was its urgency.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7989253" data-originallang="fr">I have done extensive work with the Indigenous Liberal Caucus. I therefore understand the importance of Ms. Gazan's motion. The situation of indigenous women in Winnipeg and across Canada is beyond dire, as is the crisis in general. Coercive control is also an appalling phenomenon.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7989254" data-originallang="fr">However, I would like to talk a little about the process, and ask the committee if we can take a step back. At some other committees, the chair and vice-chair are asked to meet as a subcommittee to determine the priority studies.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7989255" data-originallang="fr">Today we are going to vote on the motion, but there are other motions we'd like to consider. I just want us to be careful. Voting against the motion doesn't mean we're against it. It's just that there are many other studies we'd like to undertake. I think Ms. Ferreri understands that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7989256" data-originallang="fr">I request that we adjourn this debate to determine how we can sit down together and consider all of the motions. Ms. Gazan's motion, Ms. Larouche's motion, and many others are so important. They are all priorities. So we need to work together.</p>
