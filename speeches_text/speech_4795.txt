<p data-HoCid="8556952" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, quite frankly, common sense for the Conservatives is a bunch of nonsense.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8556953" data-originallang="en"> At the end of the day, we have organizations like the National Council of Canadian Muslims and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, two outstanding organizations, in support of passing Bill <a data-HoCid="12913297" href="/bills/44-1/C-63/" title="An Act to enact the Online Harms Act, to amend the Criminal Code, the Canadian Human Rights Act and An Act respecting the mandatory reporting of Internet child pornography by persons who provide an Internet service and to make consequential and related amendments to other Acts">C-63</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8556954" data-originallang="en"> As Conservatives continue to rely on the maga right to influence public policy, Canadians who are following the debate need to be aware that the Conservative Party is not there for the people of Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8556955" data-originallang="en"> This legislation is about children. It is about individuals whose pictures are being exploited on the Internet without consent. The legislation is there, it is tangible and it has a wide spectrum of support. Why will the Conservative Party not allow it to pass to committee today at the very least?</p>
