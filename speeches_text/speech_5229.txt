<p data-HoCid="8679200" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you to the witnesses for your testimony today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679201" data-originallang="en"> I would like to begin with Ms. Verrier-Fréchette. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679202" data-originallang="en">The U.S., the U.K., Japan, Italy, Germany, France and, of course, Canada.... We've been in lockstep with our G7 allies in the pursuit of a two-state solution. That has not been the question. It's been a long-standing policy of our country, irrespective of the party in power here in Canada, that a two-state solution as a result of negotiations that enjoys the popular support of Palestinians and Israelis is the path to peace.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679203" data-originallang="en"> However, Global Affairs Canada's website now says that recognition of the Palestinian state is not necessarily the last step along that path to achieving a two-state solution, which enjoys the support of all of our G7 partners. For Canada now to go about it.... I think it's a solid argument or widely recognized that perhaps Canada does not have the most influence of our G7 allies in the region, so what are the implications for Canada to go out ahead of our G7...? </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679204" data-originallang="en">I'll begin with Ms. Verrier-Fréchette. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679205" data-originallang="en">What are the implications, diplomatically, with our G7 partners?</p>
