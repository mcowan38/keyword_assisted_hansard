<p data-HoCid="7957427" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, I thank my hon. colleague for raising a really important question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957428" data-originallang="en">Many of us in our roles as members of Parliament have been dealing with constituents who are concerned about loved ones affected by this conflict, some who have loved ones trapped in Gaza and others whose extended family members, friends and loved ones are being held hostage by Hamas. The fact of the matter is that our government has been really prioritizing this issue. My colleagues, the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="MÃ©lanie Joly">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> and the <a data-HoCid="300003" href="/politicians/bill-blair/" title="Bill Blair">Minister of National Defence</a>, have been working non-stop on this issue, and I am happy to report to Parliament that a number of those efforts have been successful, enabling Canadians to be evacuated back to Canada, in some cases from the West Bank to Jordan and in some cases from Israel back to Canada. Those efforts are ongoing and we will do everything we can to help Canadians evacuate from Gaza, West Bank and Israel.</p>
