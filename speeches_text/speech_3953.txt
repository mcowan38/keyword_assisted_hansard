<p data-HoCid="8347713" data-originallang="en">The escalation following the bombing of the Iranian consulate in Syria and Iran's subsequent attack on Israel is extremely worrying. Canada has said little about the bombing of its own Canadian embassy building. The Iranian regime has targeted its own citizens, including women—we cannot forget that—and now it's targeting Israel. I'm very worried about the ongoing war in Gaza. Canada doesn't seem to be playing a vital role in the de-escalation of this terrible situation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8347714" data-originallang="en">Can you talk about what the Canadian government and CAF are doing to de-escalate the mounting tensions in the area?</p>
