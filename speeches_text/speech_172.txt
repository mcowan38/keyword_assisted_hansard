<p data-HoCid="6169390" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Montarville for his speech.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6169391" data-originallang="fr">I think we agree that we stand with the protesters in Hong Kong, and also with the Tibetan and Uyghur peoples. I would like to ask him about something he brought up, because the Conservatives like to pick and choose whose rights to stand up for, based on their ideological or political interests.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6169392" data-originallang="fr">Are human rights universal and should they apply to Palestinians?</p>
