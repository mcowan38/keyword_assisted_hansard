<p data-HoCid="8817648" data-originallang="en"> I think that academic freedom is in very poor shape these days. The atmosphere on campus is such that if you speak up in class to say that you're in favour of free markets, that you're in favour of Israel or that you think there might be some arguments in favour of America's role in the world, then you really do risk getting chased off campus, and sometimes literally chased off campus.</p>

I want to add that I think it's a very impoverished vision that if they're privatized, all they'll do is sell to the highest bidder. What they'll do is go out and raise money philanthropically in large amounts from the generous people who live in our wealthy country, based on their devotion to research.</p>
