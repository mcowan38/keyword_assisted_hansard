<p data-HoCid="6212869" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, there are many people in Edmonton West who have stepped up in support of our community during this crisis. While there are too many to list, I would like to highlight our faith leaders, who continue to serve their congregants virtually and Edmontonians as a whole.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6212870" data-originallang="en">I want to thank Pastor Brett at the West Edmonton Christian Assembly for collecting food for those in need. I thank Issam, Yasin, Hika, Imam Bassam and Imam Nasser from Rhama Mosque for partnering with Capital Region Housing to deliver hundreds of backpacks, and Rabbis Ari and Zolly for hosting Zoom gatherings and helping seniors. I thank Reverend Francis at Annunciation Catholic Church for making face masks for visitors to the Misericordia Community Hospital. I thank Father Leo at Good Shepherd Catholic Church for making food hampers for the needy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6212871" data-originallang="en">Thank you to all of our faith leaders for continuing to serve not only their flocks but all Edmontonians of all faiths during this crisis.</p>
