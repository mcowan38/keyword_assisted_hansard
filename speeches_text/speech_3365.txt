<p data-HoCid="8172894" data-originallang="en">Welcome to meeting 96 of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8172895" data-originallang="en"> Today’s meeting is taking place in a hybrid format, pursuant to the Standing Orders. Members may attend in person or remotely by using the Zoom application. Today everybody is attending in person.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8172896" data-originallang="en">I would like to make a few comments for the benefit of all participants. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8172897" data-originallang="en">Please wait until I recognize you by name before speaking. For interpretation, those in the room will use the earpiece that you have and select the official language of your choice. Interpretation services will be provided. You have the option of speaking in the official language of your choice. If there is a problem with interpretation or translation, please get my attention by raising your hand. We'll suspend while the issue is being clarified. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8172898" data-originallang="en">For the benefit and protection of the translators, I advise you to please keep your earpiece away from the microphone and to make sure the “vibrate” function on your telephone is not on while it is close to the mic because it will cause an issue with the translation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8172899" data-originallang="en">Again, I remind you to direct all comments through me, the chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8172900" data-originallang="en">Pursuant to the order of reference of Wednesday, September 20, 2023, the committee will begin the clause-by-clause consideration of Bill <a data-HoCid="12260777" href="/bills/44-1/C-318/" title="An Act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and the Canada Labour Code (adoptive and intended parents)">C-318</a>, an act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and the Canada Labour Code relative to adoptive and intended parents.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8172901" data-originallang="en">I will provide members of the committee with some instructions and a few comments on how the committee will proceed with the clause-by-clause consideration of Bill <a data-HoCid="12260777" href="/bills/44-1/C-318/" title="An Act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and the Canada Labour Code (adoptive and intended parents)">C-318</a>. As the name indicates, this is an examination of all the clauses in the order in which they appear in the bill. I will call each clause successively, and each clause is subject to debate and a vote.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8172902" data-originallang="en">If there are amendments to the clause in question, I will recognize the member proposing it, who may explain it. The amendment will then be open for debate. When no further members wish to intervene, the amendment will be voted on. Amendments will be considered in the order in which they appear in the bill and in the package each member received from the clerk. Members should note that amendments must be submitted in writing to the clerk of the committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8172903" data-originallang="en">The chair will go slowly to allow all members to follow the proceedings properly.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8172904" data-originallang="en">Amendments have been given an alphanumeric number in the top right corner to indicate which party submitted them. There is no need for a seconder to move an amendment. Once an amendment has been moved, you will need unanimous consent to withdraw it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8172905" data-originallang="en">During debate on an amendment, members are permitted to move subamendments. These subamendments must be submitted in writing. They do not require the approval of the mover of the amendment. Only one subamendment may be considered at a time, and that subamendment cannot be amended. When a subamendment is moved to an amendment, it is voted on first. Then another subamendment may be moved or the committee may consider the main amendment and vote on it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8172906" data-originallang="en">Once every clause has been voted on, the committee will consider and vote on the preamble, the short title, the title and the bill itself. If amendments are adopted, an order to reprint the bill may be required so that the House has a proper copy for use at report stage. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8172907" data-originallang="en">Finally, the committee will have to order the chair to report the bill to the House. That report contains only the text of adopted amendments as well as an indication of deleted clauses. </p>
