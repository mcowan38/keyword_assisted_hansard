<p data-HoCid="7407407" data-originallang="en"> How did you know that would be my favourite question to answer?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7407408" data-originallang="en">Women in trade—women entrepreneurs, period—are the smartest thing that we could be doing. We are 50% of the population. I've used this sports analogy before: If you are going to train up a wonderful team to win at your sport, you sure the heck don't want 50% of that team sitting on the bench. Why would we want 50% of the women sitting on the bench?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7407409" data-originallang="en">Our first-ever women's entrepreneurship strategy is a $6-billion investment to help women entrepreneurs start their businesses and scale and grow their businesses to access the international market.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7407410" data-originallang="en"> I often tell people not to worry about the title on my business card; I'm the minister for start-up, scale-up and access to new markets. For women entrepreneurs, I am there with them every step of the way to help them start and to help them grow.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7407411" data-originallang="en">What is the return on investment for the women's entrepreneurship strategy? It's $150 billion in Canada. We have invested $6 billion and we can return $150 billion to the Canadian economy simply by adding women to the economy. I tell my international colleagues that it's $12 trillion to the global economy by adding women to the economy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7407412" data-originallang="en">The women's entrepreneurship strategy has three parts. One is getting access to capital. We hear a lot about that from all small businesses, but women-owned businesses in particular face those difficulties. Mentorship and having an ecosystem of support is what they're looking for, and then we need to be able to track this stuff and make sure there is good data.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7407413" data-originallang="en">I'm really pleased to say that although we've only had the women's entrepreneurship ecosystem in place since 2019, it has already helped 5,000 new women-owned businesses start and helped 7,000 existing women-owned businesses grow their existing business. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7407414" data-originallang="en"> I'll highlight one of the ecosystem partners in particular, the Asia Pacific Foundation. They've been doing these really terrific women-led trade missions. They've done one to Japan in person. They've done them to Taiwan, India, Australia and New Zealand, and South Korea, and they're heading back to Japan in December. They're women-led trade missions to look for opportunities in those particular markets so that these businesses can grow. We're seeing some terrific collaborations in those markets. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7407415" data-originallang="en">We're also seeing really excellent opportunities for collaborations because there isn't a single place that I have been to where I don't convene a round table of women-led businesses. This includes France, Sweden, Africa, Thailand, the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia, Singapore, the CARICOMs and so forth. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7407416" data-originallang="en">It is dynamic. You are seeing these incredible female businesses of all sizes, and they're growing their businesses. What we're trying to do here is create those connections between Canadian businesses that want to grow into those markets and collaborate and co-invest for growth. I think it is the smartest thing that we could be doing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7407417" data-originallang="en"> The business women in international trade program is growing. The support that EDC is providing to women entrepreneurs is growing and the support that BDC is providing is growing, but I would say that economic policies alone are not going to do it. You need to have affordable child care, because women need to work, and when they work, they need support for child care. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7407418" data-originallang="en">Parental leave is a game-changer. When I was in Israel, I remember the women entrepreneurs asking me, “Are you kidding? Are you telling me that if I were in Canada, I can keep working and my partner or spouse can take the 18 months?” I said, “You've got it.” That is a game-changer.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7407419" data-originallang="en">I think smart, whole-of-government policies to support the growth of businesses are exactly what we have been doing since 2015. You sit around the table at the women's caucus and you talk to me about this all the time, but I want to thank everyone because this work is all of our work.</p>
