<p data-HoCid="6730326" data-originallang="en">Maybe the clerk can answer this. We get all these applications. We review them. We select somebody. How quickly would that funding get to them? If the deadline is in a month, would they be getting it in two months, six weeks or when? </p>
<p data-HoCid="6730327" data-originallang="en">Is it reasonable to think that if we make it only a month deadline for this, we could actually get a student the research funds in the summer or are we looking at months going by before the money will flow? I'm wondering about the logistics.</p>
