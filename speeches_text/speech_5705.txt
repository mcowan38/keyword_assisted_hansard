<p data-HoCid="8784173" data-originallang="en"> B'nai B'rith will be submitting a submission to the committee in advance of the deadline. Our seven-point plan will be contained within our submission.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8784174" data-originallang="en"> In response to your query regarding the <a data-HoCid="12913297" href="/bills/44-1/C-63/" title="An Act to enact the Online Harms Act, to amend the Criminal Code, the Canadian Human Rights Act and An Act respecting the mandatory reporting of Internet child pornography by persons who provide an Internet service and to make consequential and related amendments to other Acts">online harms</a> bill, any legislation that is passed to combat online harms must confront the reality facing the Jewish community here in Canada—but other Canadian communities as well—which is that our digital space has become a toxic cesspool, for lack of a better term, which is enabling the promotion of hate online.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8784175" data-originallang="en">It is integral that any balancing act between freedom of expression and other competing constitutional and quasi-constitutional rights take into account this new sphere, which I consider to be the Wild West. We need legislation in place that will protect against the spread and dissemination of hate online.</p>
