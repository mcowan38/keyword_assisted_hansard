<p data-HoCid="7150345" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7150346" data-originallang="en">My name is Michael Mostyn. I'm the chief executive officer for B'nai Brith. I'll be sharing my time with Marvin Rotrand, our national director of the league.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7150347" data-originallang="en">B'nai Brith is Canada's oldest grassroots Jewish community organization dedicated to eradicating racism, anti-Semitism and hatred in all of its forms, championing the rights of the marginalized while providing basic human needs for members of our community. We focus on anti-Semitism, but of course, we're concerned with all forms of discrimination. Hate is hate, whatever the source.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7150348" data-originallang="en">There are two quick items that I just want to mention in my statement. First of all, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps of Iran is an entity that my community, and many others, have been asking for years to designate as a terrorism entity. It must happen on an urgent basis.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7150349" data-originallang="en">Secondly, we need to focus, for IMVE and terrorism in general, on a system that works. Our system is being questioned at the moment. There was a front-page article in the National Post last weekend talking about Khaled Barakat. Khaled Barakat is the leader of the PFLP. That is a listed terrorist organization in Canada. Not all IMVE groups are from the right. It is a Marxist-Leninist organization. It is anti-Semitic. It is hateful. It is active, and one of its leaders is present in Canada. Canadians are questioning why he is here. It is strictly forbidden for members of terrorist groups to enter Canada, or to obtain Canadian citizenship. We have no answers as Canadian citizens.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7150350" data-originallang="en">We need to deal with IMVE. We need to deal with all of the causes. We need to deal with hate, as hate, but at the same time, when there are serious issues with respect to members of listed terrorist organizations here in Canada, Canadians demand answers. We need to all know that our system works, and is effective. We need to have a national strategy and undertaking to deal with this issue holistically.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7150351" data-originallang="en">I'd like to now pass on to my colleague, Mr. Rotrand.</p>
