<p data-HoCid="7345952" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345953" data-originallang="en">I think what we're discussing here today is, of course, the opportunity to bring the <a data-HoCid="278929" href="/politicians/pablo-rodriguez/" title="Pablo Rodriguez">minister</a> forward. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7345954" data-originallang="en">I share the many sentiments that were put forward by Mr. Housefather and by former MP Michael Levitt who tweeted this: “Looking back on events over the last [year] w/regards to Marouf affair, I'm utterly disheartened. Taking a stand against antisemitism should be a given and yet so few of my former Liberal colleagues have done so. This truly hurts. Jewish MPs shouldn't be left to call this out alone."</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345955" data-originallang="en">Having used his voice to bravely call for accountability, I commend that former member. I commend Mr. Housefather as well for the wise and brave words he spoke this past summer.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345956" data-originallang="en">We have had Minister Hussen here, but <a data-HoCid="278929" href="/politicians/pablo-rodriguez/" title="Pablo Rodriguez">Minister Rodriguez</a> is the one that can answer to the funding that went to the CRTC. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7345957" data-originallang="en">We see here two things. We see a lack of judgment from the minister involving the funding that was given and we see a lack of accountability. <a data-HoCid="278929" href="/politicians/pablo-rodriguez/" title="Pablo Rodriguez">Minister Rodriguez</a> did not speak to this situation for nearly five weeks after it came to light. We have not had an opportunity to give Mr. Rodriguez the floor to give him the chance to use his voice to help us understand why that decision was made to remain silent on such an important matter. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7345958" data-originallang="en">We also have not given him the opportunity to help us understand the mechanisms in place to hold the CRTC to account with regard to where funding is allocated or to hold Mr. Marouf accountable with regard to having received funding, how it was used, and his conduct as an individual who was a recipient. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7345959" data-originallang="en">I think it has been made clear today that Minister Hussen does not take full responsibility. He very clearly has stated that. Rather, he shares it with <a data-HoCid="278929" href="/politicians/pablo-rodriguez/" title="Pablo Rodriguez">Minister Rodriguez</a>. For that reason again, the third, I would say there is great weight to the request to have Minister Rodriguez come here to this committee so we can ask him questions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345960" data-originallang="en">The motion I have before the committee is for the purpose of calling the current government to account, which is our role as opposition members. Further, it is also the role of this committee as a whole. This committee exists to put forward studies that are of interest to the Canadian public and this is certainly one of them. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7345961" data-originallang="en">For the benefit of Canadians, I believe it is worthwhile to take a few minutes of our time—60 minutes to be specific—</p>
