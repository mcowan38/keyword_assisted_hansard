<p data-HoCid="7328635" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7328636" data-originallang="en">First, I want to thank Ms. Bendayan for the motion, which I think is an important one. Now that we're on the amendment, I'm going to dig in it a bit.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7328637" data-originallang="en">As you know, we are in public. I thought this part of the meeting would be in camera, but I'm glad it's in public because it gives me a chance to talk about a few things in this committee that I think are really important to put into the context of both the amendment and the motion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7328638" data-originallang="en">In June of this year, I attended the Northern Secondary School graduation. The Northern Secondary School is around the corner from my home. It's in my riding. I got to the graduation ceremony, and I looked out at the several hundred—300 or 400—young people graduating from high school. I had not planned on having an emotional response, but as I looked out at the kids, Maya Zibaie was not there.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7328639" data-originallang="en">Maya Zibaie was in grade 10 when she and her mother went to Iran to visit family. She was on PS752, which 1,000 days ago was shot down by a regime that was complicit, if not.... There has been a forensic study that does not draw a direct line between the government of Iran and the shooting down of the plane. However, the onus, the burden of proof, is on Iran to say and to prove that they were not engaged. Canada has, over these last thousand days, attempted in every way possible and will continue to attempt in every way possible to get justice for Mahmoud Zibaie, who lost his daughter Maya and his wife Shahrzad.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7328640" data-originallang="en">I think the issues in Iran since the so-called revolution 43 years ago have been on my mind and the minds of Canadians. We watched a theist, Islamicist government take over a society that had been deeply rooted in science and technology, in culture and linguistics, and in trade and commerce. It was a leading Islamic country. We have seen with horror how things, instead of getting better, have gotten worse for the people of Iran.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7328641" data-originallang="en">The benefit to Canada is that we have been the proud and gracious recipients of tens of thousands of Iranian Canadians, many of them identifying as Persian, but many not, including Azeris and other Iranian Canadians. I am very proud to represent a large group of them from my riding, who continue to have people-to-people ties with Iran, deep connections to what's going on in Iran and deep pain.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7328642" data-originallang="en">That is not just about this most recent horrific killing by the so-called morality police in Iran of Jina Mahsa Amini. I tend to want to use her Kurdish name, as well as her name in Farsi. I believe her name on her passport is Magda, but her Kurdish roots are important for us to recognize here as well. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7328643" data-originallang="en">Canada is a country that has attempted to live out our diversity and multicultural reality. It's not just, as we say, a fact of reality. It's a choice that diversity is a reality, and inclusion is a choice. That is something that we think Iran would benefit from, but it doesn't want to.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7328644" data-originallang="en">Since this evolution of the revolutionary government in Iran, we have seen atrocities continue, whether they're at neighbours' expenses, including the most recent bombing last weekend in Iraq, support for insurgents and other violence in Yemen, or the constant, persistent threat on Israel. It is a pathological threat to Israel that has continued and that has gained certain momentum in certain neighbouring countries from time to time; however, we know that Iran is at the epicentre of that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7328645" data-originallang="en">I'm very glad the Government of Canada, when it was a Conservative government, made strong choices about Iran. We know that was an important thing to do at that time, and I supported it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7328646" data-originallang="en">Iranian Canadians have had a variety of opinions since that time, including on the closure of the embassy, which they have pushed to reopen, but our government has not reopened the embassy. Obviously it was something that was being talked about at one point. However, things have not settled to the point where we could establish normal diplomatic relations with Iran. As we have looked at the last number of years, sanctions—</p>
