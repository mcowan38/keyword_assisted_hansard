<p data-HoCid="7581812" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Yes, we have a bit of a game plan for you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7581813" data-originallang="en">You have just heard about Hassan Diab's labyrinth of injustice from his wife, Rania Tfaily. I want to begin by really acknowledging what a courageous and remarkable woman she is and, as I think many of you said in your comments, the incredible injustices that the family has been through.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7581814" data-originallang="en">I, too, want to highlight key lessons from that case, which begins on October 3, 1980, when four people were killed and 40 others injured in a terrorist bombing outside a synagogue in Paris, a harrowing crime for which there must be justice. Twenty-eight years later on November 13, 2008, Hassan Diab, a Canadian citizen, was arrested on a French extradition request, accused of carrying out that attack. Over the next six years, he went through lengthy extradition proceedings but ultimately was extradited to France.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7581815" data-originallang="en">You've heard about the debacle of the handwriting evidence in his case, which Ontario Superior Court Justice Maranger described as “highly susceptible to criticism and impeachment.” Nevertheless, Justice Maranger concluded that he had no choice but to order extradition even though, in his words again, “the case presented by the Republic of France against Mr. Diab is a weak case; the prospects of conviction in the context of a fair trial, seem unlikely.” That was the outcome because the threshold for extradition is that low. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7581816" data-originallang="en">Hassan Diab was imprisoned in a maximum security prison in Paris for three years and two months, in solitary confinement almost the entire time. It's worth reminding ourselves that international human rights standards recognize that prolonged solitary confinement beyond 15 days constitutes torture or cruel treatment. He was held that long because, despite French assurances that they were ready to go to trial, they clearly were not. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7581817" data-originallang="en">The weak case against against Dr. Diab collapsed further. Judges eventually corroborated his long-standing claim that he had been in Lebanon writing his university exams at the time of the bombing. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7581818" data-originallang="en">Finally on January 12, 2018, French judges concluded there was insufficient evidence to charge him and ordered his release. He returned to Canada, but this was not over. The French prosecutor appealed. The appeal was upheld, and as you've heard, a trial against him will now take place in Paris in April. His extradition has not been sought a second time. Instead, he is being tried in absentia, which of course raises further fair trial and justice concerns. To call his experience Kafkaesque would be a dramatic understatement. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7581819" data-originallang="en">Further concerns have emerged about the earlier extradition proceedings, including revelations that Canadian government lawyers did not disclose exculpatory evidence that Dr. Diab's fingerprints did not match fingerprints on record and that government lawyers were actively advising the French government about how to strengthen its collapsing case against Dr. Diab. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7581820" data-originallang="en">In a 2019 external review report, former Ontario deputy attorney general Murray Segal found that the Diab case had been handled ethically, in a manner that was consistent with Canadian law. He noted, however, that he had not been tasked with reviewing Canadian extradition law and policy more broadly, and it is that qualification that makes your study of extradition reform so important. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7581821" data-originallang="en">Hassan Diab was extradited because the obvious misgivings and unease of the presiding judge that this was a weak case and that he was unlikely to be convicted in a fair trial didn't matter. He was extradited even though the extraditing state was clearly nowhere near ready to go to trial. He was held without going to trial for over three years, almost the entire time in solitary confinement, a clear violation of international human rights. Exculpatory evidence was withheld, and Canadian government lawyers appeared more intent on assisting the French government than upholding the rights of a Canadian citizen. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7581822" data-originallang="en">A Canadian citizen can be extradited to France in such spurious circumstances as this while French law does not allow any French citizen to ever be extradited to Canada. All of this happened even though Dr. Diab was represented by some of the most experienced defence lawyers in the country. If that human rights travesty is consistent with Canadian extradition law, there is something woefully wrong with extradition law.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7581823" data-originallang="en">You're going to hear a tremendous proposal for reform from Professor Currie.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7581824" data-originallang="en"> Thank you.</p>
