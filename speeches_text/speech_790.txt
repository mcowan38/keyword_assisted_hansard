<p data-HoCid="6554908" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, to the demands of Canada’s Iranian and Jewish communities that Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps be added to Canada’s list of terror groups, the <a data-HoCid="253386" href="/politicians/bill-blair/" title="Bill Blair">minister</a> deflected, saying four proxy IRGC agencies, including the Quds Force, are already listed.
