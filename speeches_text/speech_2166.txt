<p data-HoCid="7663599" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I want to speak to the previous point of order that was just raised and the use of derogatory language in this place. Right now as we speak, there are members of the Conservatives who are trying to speak over us on a really serious issue. The use of that unparliamentary language is not satisfactory to the members of the House, including many of the indigenous members.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7663600" data-originallang="en">I ask that the Speaker take seriously the consideration by the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> and that this word be retracted.</p>
