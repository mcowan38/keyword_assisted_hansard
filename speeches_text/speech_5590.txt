<p data-HoCid="8726546" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, with the leave of the House, I am going to take a moment, as a parliamentarian and as a Canadian, to address what happened this weekend.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726547" data-originallang="en">We saw an out-of-control mob take over the streets of one of the country's biggest cities. We saw people openly and proudly spewing hatred, spreading violence and thumbing their noses at the values that every single parliamentarian in this place holds dear. They were burning cars, injuring police officers and chanting slogans like the final solution was coming.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726548" data-originallang="en"> I do not know what kind of Canada this is, but it is certainly not one that I recognize. I know many Canadians feel exactly the same way after watching that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726549" data-originallang="en">The <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>'s go-to response after an incident like this one is to say that this is not Canada. However, we have to reckon with the fact that this is very much Canada. This is, of course, after he sided with the outrageous decision of the International Criminal Court drawing a false equivalency between a Liberal democracy and a terrorist organization that attacked that Liberal democracy last year, which emboldened the very supporters who took to the streets to almost burn down a city. Our country is no longer a haven for law and order, for truth and justice, for peace and for the freedom we used to have.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726550" data-originallang="en">Instead of talking about all of this, we are still here after two months of demanding the documents in this place, demanding that the Liberals turn over the documents to the police. Instead of debating the very real issues and the consequences to Canadians that happened, the violence that poured out into the streets over the last number of evenings, and days if someone was on the campus of Concordia University, we are still talking about this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726551" data-originallang="en">We have become a nation where the rights of bigots and violent rioters trump the rights of freedom of religion and, sadly, of personal safety. This is something that I never thought I would say on the floor of the House. We have become a nation where the grievances of a small, petty, lawless minority govern the lives of a larger law-abiding majority. We have become a nation where we have lost the ability to put a stop to even the most despicable behaviour.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726552" data-originallang="en">Instead, day after day in the House, we demand the same thing from the same government that refuses the same order. Day after day, we are asking the government to release the documents instead of talking about the issues with which Canadians are seized. This is a nation where it is no longer extraordinary to wake up to read that another synagogue has been firebombed, or that another Jewish business was vandalized, or that another bomb threat was made at a Jewish school or that gunshots flew through the windows.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726553" data-originallang="en">Kids as young as 17, 18 and 19 are being arrested for crimes. Children in our country are being turned against one another, blinded by our ability to teach even the most basic tenets of respect and critical thinking, with the woke academics pushing DEI ahead of introspective thought and their unions that have become a bastion of ideological drivel that has now become dangerous and has spilled out into our streets. Hate crimes in our country have more than doubled over nine years.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726554" data-originallang="en">Instead, we are still talking about a document production order two months later in the House, documents that the Speaker told the government to produce, documents that the Speaker told the government to turn over to the RCMP. That is the natural consequence of a Prime Minister and a government that cannot even utter the most basic condemnation of radical and extremist behaviour in the country, who send one group of MPs to say something to one community and a different group of MPs to say the exact opposite to another community. Those days are over.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726555" data-originallang="en"> That is how it works in the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>'s Canada, but that is not how it works in Canada. I will say one thing, because we have talked about it in the House and, most recently, from comments from the <a data-HoCid="310760" href="/politicians/karina-gould/" title="Karina Gould">government House leader</a>. Bouncy castles, hot tubs, outdoor barbecues and a protest blocking several blocks in a single city honking equals a national emergency, frozen bank accounts and prosecutions. However, rioting, targeting, harassing, intimidating the Jewish community for more than a year; torching cars, shooting synagogues and schools; calling for violence, murder, death; and celebrating actual terrorists carrying flags of terrorist organizations for over a year in our country equates to “peaceful protests” encouraged by members of the House. That is shameful and every single Canadian sees it now. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8726556" data-originallang="en">What is happening now is a hallmark of the government, a government that has held this place up for two months without turning over documents in this latest scandal of $400 million tax dollars and 186 conflicts of interest broken. There are ministers who cannot keep their jobs because they have misled the Canadian public and the House about their identity. The government has come to that. It has become a hallmark of the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>'s leadership, which has divided Canadians based on every discernible characteristic, of race, religion, gender, age, wealth, vaccine status, and the list goes on and on. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8726557" data-originallang="en">What happens when the same <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> systematically attacks the pillars of our country, whether it is our criminal justice system, our charter of freedoms, even our national symbols? He took Terry Fox out of the passport and replaced it with a squirrel. He allowed those who got the passport to take their citizenship ceremony on Zoom. That is a shame. We should have known this, because he told everybody that Canada was a “post-national state” with “no core identity”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726558" data-originallang="en"> It is what happens when the cornerstone of a Liberal government's agenda is to open our borders and let in terrorists and lawbreakers with no background checks, then call anybody who questions it a racist. Frankly, this weekend has shown everybody that Canadians are tired of it. They are tired of the government. They are tired of it holding up the debate in the House without handing over the documents that the Speaker told it to hand over. Canadians deserve to know where the $400 million in tax dollars went. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8726559" data-originallang="en">The <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> and the Liberal government have made our country a playground for foreign interference, for division, for people who hate us to come here, and they have rolled out the welcome mat. Then what did the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> do? He left us in the cold. The chants of death to Jews grew louder in front of synagogues. He ignores calls for safety and security. As his threats to communities got more intense, he ignored and silenced the voices in his own caucus, voices that are supposed to be the ones speaking out, the voices that are supposed to be standing up for their communities, that are supposed to have a seat at the table. He has shoved them out of the room and does not listen to them anymore.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726560" data-originallang="en">As the masked mob took over the streets of Montreal, the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> decided it would be better to spend the night dancing. My question is this. When was he told and after he was told, did he stay there? Why did it take him an entire day, until 12 o'clock the next day, to utter even the most basic condemnation of what happened in his own city that night? </p>
<p data-HoCid="8726561" data-originallang="en">This is a country that welcomed generations of people from around the world, gave them shelter from persecution, and now we see that in our streets. This is a country that used to stand up for our allies and for values around the world. This was a country that wherever people came from, whoever they were, they could come here, become a Canadian and be proud of it. We are not that country anymore. It breaks my heart to see it and I am sure it breaks the heart of every Canadian to see and witness what happened this weekend. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8726562" data-originallang="en">Glossing over the clear problems and pretending they do not exist, as the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> does, is no way to run a country. It is no way to even run a Parliament. He certainly has not acquiesced to that demand we are still here for today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726563" data-originallang="en"> When someone has the courage to stand and say that what is happening here is wrong, that they refuse to stand by it because they love what is being destroyed, that is a country worth living in. This is the kind of leadership and courage we need. That courage is growing. It is not only growing with me, but with Canadians right across the country, from all stripes, from coast to coast. They want the country they used to know back. Canadians have had enough of the virtue signalling, the holier-than-thou preaching, the lawlessness, the out-of-control crime, the free drugs and the chaos in our streets.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726564" data-originallang="en"> Canadians just want to go to work, raise a family and be able to afford a decent home in a safe neighbourhood. They want to do that without being told how to think by some out-of-touch politician in Ottawa. Canadians just want to wake up from this woke nightmare and bring back the Canada we used to know. These are not the Canadians that we find occupying the streets of Montreal, rioting violently. They are not the ones camping out on the front lawn of a university campus for months at a time or engaging in terrorist cosplay weekend after weekend.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726565" data-originallang="en">They are the Canadians we find on a shop floor, in a small business along Main Street, in legion halls, in town squares and in communities everywhere. They might be quiet, but they are the real heart of our country. They are going to have a champion when we elect a common-sense national majority Conservative government. We are going to deliver a country that is finally respected on the world stage and does not make headlines with what is happening in our streets.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726566" data-originallang="en"> With that, I want to transition to the topic that has brought us here, day after day, over the last two months. For me, it is the third time in just a few weeks that I have made one simple request of the Liberal government, which is to release the documents. The Liberals could end this today, right now. I suspect that this is exactly what every member of the Conservative caucus has said, day in and day out. It is what we will say today to hold the government to account, to make sure that it hands over the documents and tells Canadian taxpayers exactly where it spent that tax money.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726567" data-originallang="en"> The House and every single Canadian taxpayer deserve to know how much money was wasted, just how the government wasted it and exactly who got rich. The evidence has been missing for months. Now the Liberals will stop at nothing to continue to keep up the secret that has had us here for week after week and now month after month as they fight tooth and nail to hide the paper trail.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726568" data-originallang="en">It is said that the third time is the charm, but I am not feeling particularly hopeful today, in terms of getting the documents. We have seen the extent to which the government will try to cover this up, day after day, with thousands of redacted documents. The government is relying on the furthest extent of its power to keep information secret.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726569" data-originallang="en"> We can let that sink in. For everybody watching at home, I say that the Liberals have paused Parliament. They have thrown sand in the gears of every single one of their agenda items, in every single way that they claim to be helping Canadians. Every piece of legislation, every motion, everything has come to a grinding halt because the Liberals have a secret; they are keeping that secret from Canadians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726570" data-originallang="en"> If only the Liberal government would tell us what is behind the black lines on those pieces of paper and hand over the missing documents, this crisis of Parliament would be over in just one minute. It is that simple. If the government had nothing to hide behind those black lines and those missing documents, then it should not be such a problem. It would tell us what it is withholding in terms of information. Again, the Liberals are willing to put their spending plans on hold. All their fiscal estimates and every piece of legislation are on the line. This behaviour is nothing short of crazy and paranoid, if anybody is watching this. What are they hiding?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726571" data-originallang="en"> After nine years of the Liberal government, there is a culture of corruption in Ottawa, and everybody now sees it. It is a culture that leads those at the top to think that they are immune from accountability, that they can reward their well-connected insider friends at the expense of everyone else. It leads them to think that the rights of Canadians and of Parliament do not really matter. However, these rights do matter. The government is certainly not immune from accountability. We will make sure of that, just as every opposition has done for hundreds of years in this system.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726572" data-originallang="en"> While Canadians are certainly taking notice of the matter at hand today, they are also paying close attention to another matter, or should I say to someone else. Our old friend, the other Randy, is a guy made up by a minister of the Crown in an effort to weave a web of lies around fraudulent business activity. It is another example of just how out of touch and out of control the Liberal government has become.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726573" data-originallang="en">Let us recap the saga. It was against the law for anyone conducting government business to carry on with their business activities. That should be obvious; that was a blatant conflict of interest, similar to the 186 conflicts of interest that we are talking about today. However, the former <a data-HoCid="278761" href="/politicians/randy-boissonnault/" title="Randy Boissonnault">minister of employment</a> seems to have contravened those rules, and messages showed up of conversations between partners at the minister's old firm and a certain Randy. Those messages clearly showed that the minister was breaking the laws that he had sworn to uphold, but the former minister insists that it was not him; it was a different Randy, but he just could not tell us Randy's last name or even who Randy was. All the records show that there was nobody else at the firm with the first name Randy, so who is the other Randy? I do not know.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726574" data-originallang="en">The story does not stop there. While he was sitting around the cabinet table, the former <a data-HoCid="278761" href="/politicians/randy-boissonnault/" title="Randy Boissonnault">minister</a>'s old company got tens of thousands of tax dollars, which is something that was reported at least two months after the required disclosure deadline. However, it gets better. As a part of these contracts and a part of the marketing efforts of, I suspect, the company that the other Randy was engaged in, the former minister's company branded itself as 100% indigenous owned, meaning that the former minister was indigenous. He publicly reaffirmed his claim to have indigenous heritage or bloodlines several times. The Liberal Party itself took advantage of that too and included him in a list of indigenous MPs. Now we know that none of that was true. It was a farce from start to finish. The former <a data-HoCid="278761" href="/politicians/randy-boissonnault/" title="Randy Boissonnault">minister</a> not only misled Canadians but also perpetuated a very long series of injustices against indigenous communities and stole from them. He stole resources meant to help indigenous people in order to benefit and enrich himself.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726575" data-originallang="en"> We tried to get answers about all of this; again, the Liberals and their henchmen did everything possible to stand in the way of accountability. Minister after minister, with a mic in their face, said they had confidence in him. However, from his own business partners, we had radio silence. Their numbers were disconnected, and their emails were deactivated; the business partners were nowhere to be found. Nevertheless, ministers in the current government said that they had full confidence in the minister, just a day before he decided that he was going to step aside to clear his name. The former <a data-HoCid="278761" href="/politicians/randy-boissonnault/" title="Randy Boissonnault">minister</a> magically got his business partners to disappear and somehow convinced his own cabinet colleagues that he still had the confidence of Canadians, after misleading this place over and over again.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726576" data-originallang="en"> Any one of these things would have gotten any minister fired. I was here as a staff person when a $16 orange juice would have gotten someone fired as a minister. Today, we are seeing the refusal to hand over documents and turn over documents to the police as ordered by the House. This is not only a breach of parliamentary privilege but also part of a long series of events and a culture of corruption that have become hallmarks of the Liberal government and of Ottawa. It is very unfortunate, and we will stand here day after day and month after month and demand accountability from the government on the other Randy, on the <a data-HoCid="278761" href="/politicians/randy-boissonnault/" title="Randy Boissonnault">minister</a> of the Crown, on these documents and on every other scandal that is unravelling at the feet of the current government.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726577" data-originallang="en"> This is probably the worst part of it: Liberals themselves are now sounding the alarm bells. I am sure that members remember the former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, who was actually indigenous. Here is what she had to say: “A Prime Minister committed to true reconciliation would have removed [the minister] from Cabinet long ago. Instead we get to watch white people play ancestry wheel of fortune.” The <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> fired his first indigenous attorney general but kept the fake-indigenous <a data-HoCid="278761" href="/politicians/randy-boissonnault/" title="Randy Boissonnault">employment minister</a>. Just as Jody Wilson-Raybould said, it is extremely “shameful and extremely destructive”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726578" data-originallang="en"> It is extremely shameful and destructive that we still stand here, day after day, month after month, with exactly the same demand for the Liberals' accountability to Parliament, to Canadians and to every single taxpayer. They should know exactly where that $400 million went, which friends were enriched and what happened in the 186 conflicts of interest that are still at the Liberals' feet. Day after day, we will demand this again.</p>
