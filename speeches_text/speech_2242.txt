<p data-HoCid="7651810" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I would like to start my comments with respect to Bill <a data-HoCid="11526067" href="/bills/44-1/C-226/" title="An Act respecting the development of a national strategy to assess, prevent and address environmental racism and to advance environmental justice">C-226</a> and acknowledge that we are here today on the traditional unceded territory of the Algonquin people. The land acknowledgement is really important in understanding why we are talking about this bill. It is because what we are discussing really impacts the marginalized, racialized and indigenous communities of this country, which have struggled with environmental injustice for decades.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7651811" data-originallang="en">I am honoured to rise this evening to speak to Bill <a data-HoCid="11526067" href="/bills/44-1/C-226/" title="An Act respecting the development of a national strategy to assess, prevent and address environmental racism and to advance environmental justice">C-226</a> because, as mentioned, this bill has been sponsored by the member for <a data-HoCid="278722" href="/politicians/elizabeth-may/" title="Elizabeth May">Saanich—Gulf Islands</a>. I will note, as she did, that it was first introduced in the 43rd Parliament by a friend and colleague, Lenore Zann, who is the former member of Parliament for Cumberland—Colchester. I had the honour and privilege of working on that bill in the 43rd Parliament with my colleague from <a data-HoCid="278625" href="/politicians/laurel-collins/" title="Laurel Collins">Victoria</a>. As the member for Saanich—Gulf Islands noted, bringing the bill to this point really does feel like a mothering process in many ways. We are getting to see this day come for what we knew, as women, was so important for so many vulnerable communities across this country from coast to coast to coast, and we are getting the bill to where it is today in the chamber.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7651812" data-originallang="en">Until its introduction in the previous Parliament, environmental racism had been recognized as a problem for quite a long time, particularly in the United States, but it was still a fairly new concept here. We were not sure how to address it or discuss it. With its passage, this legislation would require for the first time a national strategy to address environmental racism. This whole process, whether it was in the 43rd Parliament or where we are now, has encouraged us to finally have this important conversation because many women and many leaders across this country have been having this conversation and pushing this issue for decades.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7651813" data-originallang="en">It comes at a time when Canadian society has a renewed focus on trying to understand the essential work of combatting both systemic racism and climate change. For many it was a question of how these things go hand in hand, but they do. Environmental racism really has to be part of the conversation when we talk about climate change. We cannot ignore what was really a blind spot for many in terms of addressing what environmental justice is.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7651814" data-originallang="en"> We have talked about unconscious bias when it comes to racism and the potential unintended consequences, even in the House recently, of the many issues we are discussing that lead to racism in our society. Being Jewish, I see a rise in anti-Semitism now as well. We have to talk about these things, even when they are uncomfortable, and environmental justice is included in that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7651815" data-originallang="en">We are in the process of updating the Canadian Environmental Protection Act at this time. It is a very good sign that here in this place, we are making sure that environmental racism and the right to a healthy environment are part of the debate and the discussion tonight, as well as in the environment committee and other spaces.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7651816" data-originallang="en">Environmental justice and the impacts of environmental racism are now an important part of the national conversation and not just here in this chamber but with the many folks we have met along the way. Whether we look back at Bill <a data-HoCid="10866225" href="/bills/43-2/C-230/" title="An Act respecting the development of a national strategy to redress environmental racism">C-230</a> in the 43rd Parliament or we look at Bill <a data-HoCid="11526067" href="/bills/44-1/C-226/" title="An Act respecting the development of a national strategy to assess, prevent and address environmental racism and to advance environmental justice">C-226</a> today, the advocates across Canada have really been pushing us along and mothering this bill in many ways. It is important to define and frame the conversation so that we understand why it is so important.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7651817" data-originallang="en">Environmental racism happens when environmental policies or practices, like the placement of polluting industries, result in a disproportionately negative impact on groups or communities based on race or colour. Affected marginalized communities often lack the political power to influence decisions or advocate for stronger standards. That is why they rely on us, as parliamentarians and as these women's voices, to push this along.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7651818" data-originallang="en"> It has become increasingly apparent that environmental benefits and harms are not shared equally. We talk about equity in many other aspects of Canadian life, but it is important that it is placed clearly here as well because environmental justice and environmental equity should be shared equally among all members of our society. This is not a new problem, but it is a new realization. Those in power have not discussed this in terms of addressing it with our marginalized groups, who have finally said it to us. Dr. Ingrid Waldron shared that for 70 years, communities in Nova Scotia have been waiting for us to have a substantive discussion on this. That time has come.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7651819" data-originallang="en">Indigenous and racialized communities, particularly those with lower socio-economic status, bear a disproportionate share of the environmental burdens and consequences when we deal with pollution, exposure to toxic substances, and land and water degradation. There is no magic bullet to fix this. I do not think anyone in good faith would suggest that the bill's purpose is to do that. I know that in previous debates, some of my Conservative colleagues said there is no point as we will never get it done. There is no magic way to fix systemic racism. There is no magic way to fix climate change. However, we have to start. We have to begin the process, and Bill <a data-HoCid="11526067" href="/bills/44-1/C-226/" title="An Act respecting the development of a national strategy to assess, prevent and address environmental racism and to advance environmental justice">C-226</a> clearly has the first steps.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7651820" data-originallang="en">At the end of the day, we want to make sure that no one's health is compromised and no one's quality of life is compromised because of where they live or, more importantly, because of who they are. This is about ensuring the health and dignity of all peoples regardless of their background. It is not a bill of one-off action. I know my colleague from <a data-HoCid="278722" href="/politicians/elizabeth-may/" title="Elizabeth May">Saanich—Gulf Islands</a> has asked for us to consider a more robust approach than the national strategy, but I really want to applaud that we have gotten here to the first step.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7651821" data-originallang="en">Communities across the country have been affected, whether through higher rates of cancer and other diseases or through the destruction of local habitats and natural environments. At the end of the day, we have to address those environmental impacts so that the quality of life for these communities going forward, after years of disproportionate impacts, starts to change.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7651822" data-originallang="en">I know my time is coming to an end, so I want to circle back to the idea of women. I think there is a really important role for them to play. The member for <a data-HoCid="278722" href="/politicians/elizabeth-may/" title="Elizabeth May">Saanich—Gulf Islands</a>, the member for <a data-HoCid="278625" href="/politicians/laurel-collins/" title="Laurel Collins">Victoria</a> and I have been involved in this process, as have others. As women, we are the ones who notice things first. We are the observers, often in silence, of the damage being caused around us. We know when things are off. We know when someone is not okay. We know when someone's health has been compromised because we have watched it from generation to generation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7651823" data-originallang="en">To each of the women who were part of the journey for Bill <a data-HoCid="11526067" href="/bills/44-1/C-226/" title="An Act respecting the development of a national strategy to assess, prevent and address environmental racism and to advance environmental justice">C-226</a>, including Dr. Ingrid Waldron, we have heard the journey to get to this point. The passing of this legislation today is really about the work of the women of these communities who have been fighting for the health of their communities, the health of their families, the health of their children and the health of the future so they can promise their children and generations going forward a safer and cleaner environment. Frankly, there is no other option than to push forward and contemplate these things.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7651824" data-originallang="en">In answer to my colleague in an earlier debate who said we will not get this done, I will share something that comes from my own tradition. We say, “It is not upon you to build the kingdom, but it is your responsibility to begin the work.” Women have been doing the work on this, from our friend Lenore Zann to those who are here today to the women of the many indigenous and racialized communities across this country who care about the future and health of generations to come. By putting this into law, we are acknowledging their work and putting a process into place.</p>
