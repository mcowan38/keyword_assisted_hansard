<p data-HoCid="7347843" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, there is absolutely no doubt that the comments made by this individual and this organization are absolutely appalling. We condemn the anti-Semitism, racism and hatred that he has spread over a number of years.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7347844" data-originallang="en">I want to thank my colleague, the member of Parliament for <a data-HoCid="278383" href="/politicians/anthony-housefather/" title="Anthony Housefather">Mount Royal</a>, for bringing this individual to our attention. When this issue was raised, we immediately asked the department to confirm the project funding details and inform us about the procedural next steps. After the review, we followed the process in place, cut the funding to this organization and demanded the money back.</p>
