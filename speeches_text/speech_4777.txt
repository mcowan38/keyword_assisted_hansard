<p data-HoCid="8585542" data-originallang="en">Professor Massie, I want to talk to you about the DPU, in terms of the fact that it talks a lot about the relationships we have in the defence industry. There were a lot of conversations—of course, recently—about our domestic arms industry and ensuring that it aligns with Canadian values. We saw a lot of questions, especially around the NDP's motion to end arms sales to Israel, yet there's a continuation of the exportation of Canadian weapons. Can you talk about how the DPU could or should have been used to better align our Canadian values with our own arms sales strategy and also international humanitarian law?</p>
