<p data-HoCid="8372851" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372852" data-originallang="fr">My first comments are for Ms. Gazan to thank her for moving this motion, which is entirely appropriate. It is to thank our esteemed colleague Karen Vecchio for her years of service in the position of chair of this committee. It is very well deserved.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372853" data-originallang="fr">I have also had the privilege of being her shadow minister, as we say in our parliamentary jargon, and I have seen what a dedicated woman and exemplary member she is, one who is valued by all parliamentary colleagues, particularly those who sit on our committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372854" data-originallang="fr">I would like Ms. Gazan's motion to be put to the vote, Madam Chair, without our having to spend a lot of time on it. If Ms. Vecchio were here, she would agree with me. I know her well enough to say that. What time we take to talk about this motion will be to say that we support it and we are ready to vote.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372855" data-originallang="fr">That is time we will not have for discussing some very important subjects, such as the study we are doing on the red dress alert. That study is also very dear to the heart of our colleague Leah Gazan, with good reason. The alert will mean that a process can be put in place, a system to protect indigenous women and girls, in particular, from dangers we want to see them protected against.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372856" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Madam Chair. We observed your ability to bounce back and your sense of duty at our most recent meeting. We are familiar with your goodwill. I know you too. You are serious, dedicated and determined, and I am confident that you will be able to move the discussions along on the very important subjects we tackle here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372857" data-originallang="fr">And so, colleagues, I am pleading with you this morning. Let us not make this motion a springboard for purely partisan and political discussions. Let us use this motion to say how much we value Ms. Vecchio and her work as a member of Parliament. We sincerely thank her for the work she has done.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372858" data-originallang="fr">Let us not go off on tangents that take us far away from what the motion is all about.</p>
