<p data-HoCid="8455634" data-originallang="fr">Thank you very much for that important question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455635" data-originallang="en">The point I would make on this is that we often talk about academic freedom and freedom of expression as being in balance with the need for respect and for preventing discrimination, but I think it's also important to see how much these complement each other.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455636" data-originallang="en">The message we've been hearing in talking to Jewish students and scholars is that one of the consequences of not equally applying codes of conduct and other policies is that it deprives them of their academic freedom and their proper freedom of expression. That's when a university in our society begins to really experience difficulties, because it's premised on all people having those freedoms.</p>
