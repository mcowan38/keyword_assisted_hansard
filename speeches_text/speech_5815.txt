<p data-HoCid="8817538" data-originallang="en">Turkeyy's biggest concern, I think, is the SDF, or the Syrian Democratic Forces, which is the U.S.-backed political-military organization that essentially controls a third of Syria. Everything north and east of the Euphrates is de facto under the control of the SDF. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8817539" data-originallang="en">Turkeyy has already been attacking SDF units since the HTS takeover and since the unfreezing of the military situation there. I think it remains to be seen. The U.S. is there with the SDF, legally, to destroy and then prevent the re-emergence of ISIS. There will have to be some serious discussions, I guess behind the scenes, between the U.S. and Turkeyy about what the future of eastern Syria is. Right now it's not under the control of anybody in Damascus; it's under the local control of the SDF. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8817540" data-originallang="en"> Israel has already mounted sort of a limited incursion into Syria. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8817541" data-originallang="en">I was in Israel in 2018, standing on the Golan Heights. At the time, a Sunni opposition group was in control of Daraa province in Syria. The Israeli army officer with us said that they were more comfortable with them than the Assad regime across their border because where the Assad regime comes, the Iranians come with. I think Israel is probably happy about the fall of the Assad regime and the collapse of Iranian influence in Syria, but is watching very closely to see what happens across the border. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8817542" data-originallang="en">I think I'll leave it there because I don't have a lot of expertise in the other two. </p>
