<p data-HoCid="7110849" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I want to wish <em>Eid Mubarak</em> to the entire Muslim community back home in my neighbourhood in Montreal and across the country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7110850" data-originallang="fr">As we mark the end of the sacred month of Ramadan, I am thinking of our Moroccan community, and in particular its patriarch, Abdelghani Dades. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7110851" data-originallang="fr">My friend, Mr. Dades, is the driving force of the Moroccan-Canadian community. He and I share the mission of bringing the Jewish and Muslim communities together, both here and around the world.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7110852" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Dades is most certainly wondering why I am paying tribute to him today. This year, we are celebrating the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Canada and Morocco.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7110853" data-originallang="fr">I would like him to hear his name in the House of Commons, and I would like him to know how much our government appreciates everything he has done and will continue to do to ensure this friendship lasts forever.</p>
