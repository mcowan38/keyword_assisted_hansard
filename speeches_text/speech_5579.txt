<p data-HoCid="8731623" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair, and congratulations to you on your first day as chair of this committee. It's certainly a significant role, and we wish you the best of luck.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8731624" data-originallang="en">Also, on behalf of Conservative members, I wish Mr. McKinnon very well in his next chapter and appreciate his efforts on this committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8731625" data-originallang="en">I'm glad to speak to our Conservative motion. We really haven't had the opportunity to put any words on the record, I think, since we first moved it, so I appreciate being able to speak, Mr. Chair. Certainly, I worked diligently to craft that motion with my colleagues. Mr. Chair, you would have heard before you were in the role of chair that Conservatives have concerns that we don't have a schedule in this committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8731626" data-originallang="en">Previous iterations of this committee have had an agreed-upon schedule where we ensure that the motions are debated. Then we agree on what we're going to study and in what order. We have a situation at this committee that's been noted by a number of different parties: that there hasn't been consistency. For example, we don't officially know what we're studying on Thursday, or next Tuesday, or the Thursday after. That has been in discussion for a number of weeks, and we've been asking the chair, the former chair of this committee, to bring forward a calendar of events to anticipate things regarding what we've already passed. That was not done. Our thought process on this motion was to put forward sort of an order that we can agree to as a committee and have that debated to formalize what we're going to study.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8731627" data-originallang="en">As you'll recall, Mr. Chair, all parties agreed to a minimum of six meetings for the India study. The Russia study does not have any number of meetings, which is a bit unusual. It's not unprecedented, but it's a bit unusual certainly in my experience to have a study with no agreed-upon number of meetings. It's odd, and it doesn't allow us to make any definitive plans for future studies or issues. When we put together the motion in its original form, our aim was certainly to have a number of meetings, eight, on the Russia study. We thought that would make sense. That's a pretty standard, respectable, long study. Since we agreed to six on India and since I know the Liberals want to bring back the social media platforms.... They also want to summon—we, as a committee, want to summon, in fact—a number of other witnesses who have refused to come willingly on the Russia study. That's two more meetings; that's fair enough.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8731628" data-originallang="en">On India, we've had two meetings already, meaning we have four left. Because we've already agreed to six meetings on India, we didn't feel it was necessary to include it. Russia is specifically mentioned so that we can put a number on how long we want that study to be. Again, eight seems very reasonable. The India is six; that seems reasonable. Those are lengthy robust studies. That is the objective, first and foremost, of the first paragraph in the original motion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8731629" data-originallang="en"> I showed that original motion to my NDP and Bloc colleagues, and we had a good discussion about that. It was verbally implied and explicitly talked about that, of course, we'd finish India in the six we agreed to and that we'll do eight on Russia.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8731630" data-originallang="en">I do appreciate Mr. MacGregor's moving an amendment just to clarify on the India study. That has been a very robust study. I really appreciate the opportunity to hear from the CSIS director, the national security adviser and others, and we look forward to doing those six meetings, as agreed upon. If we want more, then, of course, we can do that. However, it certainly was not left out as a purposeful manoeuver of some kind. It was just that we've already agreed to six, so that doesn't need to be explicitly said in the motion. Russia does not have an agreed-upon number of meetings, so we have suggested eight.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8731631" data-originallang="en">Then, of course, we agreed as a committee.... Actually, the NDP brought forward a motion in essence about mental health and the impact of substance abuse and other things. We agree that's obviously a very important issue. There have been 40,000 people killed in Canada because of that, and it's really causing a lot of chaos, mayhem, crime and pain in vulnerable communities and to other innocent people in our cities and elsewhere. We agree very much that we should study that. He hadn't formally moved that motion, but he put it on notice a number of weeks ago. We do think that's something we can all agree to study as a committee. Really, the NDP wanted to move it for him because we know it was important to him.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8731632" data-originallang="en">Then, of course, the other motion mentioned in there to be included is the study that I brought forward to review and bring an expert testimony on violence against women and children, including sexual violence. For example, I'm sure everyone in this committee is aware—we all read the news—that just a few weeks ago a mother was murdered in front of her kids in broad daylight in a park not too far from here in Ottawa. It was presumably by her intimate partner, who just jumped out of a car, stabbed her repeatedly and slit her throat in front of her kids. Unfortunately, there's a lot of that going on in this country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8731633" data-originallang="en"> In fact, certain jurisdictions in Ontario specifically have declared femicide to be at a crisis level. I think one woman is murdered every two days in Canada. In some areas, it's even more. Obviously, that's a critical issue of public safety. We need to hear from police services across the country and others involved in that violence on how to prevent it and how to deal with the perpetrators to ensure that justice is brought to them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8731634" data-originallang="en">In essence, that was the thought process behind this, Mr. Chair. It was an effort to bring forward a schedule and a recognition that we have agreed, as a committee, to study India for at least six meetings. We had not agreed on a number of meetings for Russia. We proposed eight and a number of other issues.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8731635" data-originallang="en">Oh, there's also the last one. My apologies. I forgot. The last part of that amendment was to bring back the ministers of public safety and immigration, which we'd agreed to as a committee, to answer on their investigation of that father-son duo who had come in through the immigration stream and were planning to do a terrorist attack in Toronto. Many have had concerns that it was on the Jewish community. As well, there was the Pakistani gentleman on a student visa here in Canada who was on his way to Brooklyn, New York, to murder Jews on the first anniversary of October 7.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8731636" data-originallang="en">We had agreed, again as a committee, to a lot of the things in this motion. The objective of this, which I wrote—unless other members want to call me a liar, which I welcome them to do and would be happy to address—was to set a calendar. We welcome debate on that and competing priorities and what have you, but certainly Conservatives have agreed to the India study. We've agreed to the Russia study. We've a lot to learn in those studies.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8731637" data-originallang="en">There are many members from particularly the Sikh community in my riding. I've consulted with them at length. I am very aware of how critical this issue is to that community, and frankly to all Canadians. The idea that a foreign government is looking to murder people on Canadian soil is just such an affront to our safety as Canadians but also our sovereignty. We've all put words on the record on that. To suggest that we don't want to study India is just patently false. There's a lot that's been said that I don't think really needs to be addressed from the Liberals, but that's certainly our intention with this motion. We hope we can get a real calendar together so that we can actually have a functioning committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8731638" data-originallang="en">I will say that it's been over a meeting and a half, Mr. Chair, that all of our work has been stopped because of this filibuster. I just find it odd that when an argument is being made about “we need to study this issue, we need to study that issue, but there's a filibuster going on”, from those making that claim, it just doesn't really hold water, obviously. If they want to study it, let's get to work. That's what we're trying to do. We very much support Mr. MacGregor's amendment in that regard.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8731639" data-originallang="en">I would also say that you are aware, Mr. Chair, that we had put forward a Standing Order 106(4) letter. It was recently just revealed in the news—it's shocking that we didn't learn about this sooner—that just under a year ago, there was an ISIS plot to bomb Parliament Hill, particularly a Jewish—</p>
