<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I welcome the member for <a data-HoCid="269650" href="/politicians/yaara-saks/" title="Ya'ara Saks">York Centre</a>'s question, and condemn in the strongest possible terms the despicable anti-Semitic attack that occurred at Shaar Hashomayim in my community.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial have absolutely no place in our society. This is why Canada has appointed the Hon. Irwin Cotler as Canada's special envoy on preserving Holocaust remembrance and combatting anti-Semitism to lead this work. I am confident that, as special envoy, Mr. Cotler will help advance Canada's efforts to promote Holocaust education, awareness and remembrance and take meaningful action to combat anti-Semitism at home and abroad.</p>
