<p data-HoCid="8794118" data-originallang="en">I know you referenced it in your opening statement, and we got to it in the first round of questions. How important is it for the anti-racism strategy put forward by the government to include a definition of anti-Palestinian racism? As you pointed out, there is one that's globally agreed upon. How important is it for the strategy itself to include that definition within it?</p>
