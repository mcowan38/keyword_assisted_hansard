<p data-HoCid="7345618" data-originallang="fr"> Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345619" data-originallang="fr">Minister, on September 12, you stated in an interview with the National Post that the incident involving Laith Marouf was a system failure. On that day, you announced that a host of measures would be put in place to prevent it from happening again. Reading these measures, one thinks that common sense would dictate that they should already have been in place, especially for the implementation of a program like the one you wanted to put in place at that time with Mr. Marouf's company.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345620" data-originallang="fr">What measures were in place before this incident? How was the due diligence carried out on companies that were entrusted with large sums of public money to go and provide training on such sensitive issues as anti-racism or anti-Semitism?</p>
