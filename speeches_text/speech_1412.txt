<p data-HoCid="7002277" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002278" data-originallang="en">I'm going to direct my questions to Mr. Neuer.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002279" data-originallang="en">Mr. Neuer, like you, I take issue with the suggestion that Israel is the number one human rights issue in the world. It is a thriving democracy with an independent judiciary, and it has a strong track record overall when it comes to human rights.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002280" data-originallang="en">Now I want to address a specific issue, namely the recent nomination of the special rapporteur on Palestine, which occurred last Thursday. The person nominated was Francesca Albanese. Do you have concerns with this nomination?</p>
