<p data-HoCid="8067997" data-originallang="en">Thanks very much, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8067998" data-originallang="en">Thanks to our witnesses for being here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8067999" data-originallang="en">In the fallout of the October 7 attack on Israeli citizens, there was information shared by a terrorist organization that the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="MÃ©lanie Joly">foreign affairs minister</a>, other members of the government, and other political parties shared: that the IDF had bombed a hospital. This spread rapid-fire on social media yet was deemed very quickly to be categorically false. Our Five Eyes allies knew that this was misinformation, but our government refused to retract it. That is an example.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8068000" data-originallang="en">Ms. Henderson, can you share how that sort of action of the government would contribute to the erosion of trust, and share some of the challenges associated with social media and the influence that foreign states could have over the Canadian population?</p>
