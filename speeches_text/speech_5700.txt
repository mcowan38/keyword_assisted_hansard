<p data-HoCid="8753527" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, last month, as part of an anti-Israel mob in Montreal, a woman named Mai Abdulhadi was recorded giving Nazi salutes and stating that the “final solution” was coming. It turns out that this woman was a franchise owner of two Second Cup cafes at Montreal's Jewish hospital.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8753528" data-originallang="en">Peter Mammas, the CEO of the company that owns the Second Cup coffee chain, swiftly issued a statement unequivocally condemning the deplorable actions of this woman and immediately terminated her relationship with his company. I would like to commend Mr. Mammas for demonstrating moral clarity when it was required. By acting swiftly and decisively, he showed that he would give no quarter to anti-Semites.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8753529" data-originallang="en">Compare that to the actions of the Liberal government, which has tried to appease those who stoke division and hate in Canada. That it took the<a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> almost a day to issue any sort of statement with regard to the recent anti-Semitic Montreal riots is a disgrace.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8753530" data-originallang="en">I thank Peter Mammas for demonstrating the strong, decisive moral clarity needed to maintain Canada's peaceful pluralism. The <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> could learn a thing or two from him.</p>
