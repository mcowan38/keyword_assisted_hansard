<p data-HoCid="8405929" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405930" data-originallang="en">I just have to say thank you to all of you for coming here and sharing your stories. I don't think anyone could hear them without really being horrified. I want to say how brave you all are for coming here and telling your stories. I know it will make a difference.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405931" data-originallang="en"> I can't help but feel that this is an historic meeting. We are finally trying to deal with the issue of anti-Semitism in this country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405932" data-originallang="en">Mr. Oberman, you talked about the blank page and moving forward and legislating, but I want to turn the clock back to October 7 and the period between then and now. The reality is that the actions of our government have not made things better. They've actually made things far worse. I'm going to take you through a number of situations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405933" data-originallang="en">For example, just after October 7, the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> publicly scolded Israel and the IDF for bombing a hospital in Gaza without having all of the necessary information. It came out after that the cause was actually misfired rockets from inside Gaza, and that the IDF had nothing to do with it. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8405934" data-originallang="en">Still, this was the Prime Minister of Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405935" data-originallang="en">He directed his ambassador to the UN to vote for a blatantly anti-Israel ceasefire motion at the UN, siding with the anti-Israel UN mob. He rewarded Hamas by blocking arms sales to Israel after Hamas brutally murdered 1,200 civilians and took 200 more hostage. Worse, he failed to remove the arms ban even after Iran launched a direct attack on Israel's territory with hundreds of missiles and drones. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8405936" data-originallang="en">He rewarded Hamas by reinstating funding to UNRWA, even though UNRWA employees participated in the October 7 attacks.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405937" data-originallang="en">He failed to unequivocally condemn the frivolous genocide convention claim launched by South Africa at the ICJ.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405938" data-originallang="en">I think the worst thing of all, which I was present in the House for, is that he voted with his caucus, present company excepted, for a motion in Parliament that actually punished our democratic ally, Israel, and rewarded the terrorists of Hamas. Worse than all of that, at the end of that vote, almost every Liberal, present company excepted, stood up and gave themselves a standing ovation, with the NDP, in the House of Commons because they were proud of the fact that they passed this motion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405939" data-originallang="en">Therefore, Mr. Oberman, would you agree that the actions, and not just the inaction, of this Liberal government since October 7 have fanned the flames of anti-Semitism in Canada and exacerbated the problem on university campuses?</p>
