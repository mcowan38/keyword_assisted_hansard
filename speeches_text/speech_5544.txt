<p data-HoCid="8733854" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I want to thank my colleagues for undertaking what I believe to be a very important study. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8733855" data-originallang="en">Of course, democracy is only valued if people have a voice and are able to exercise that voice, if people are able to manifest that voice in a way that their counterparts or other Canadians could understand, and if they are able to have tough conversations that democratic societies must ensure they have in order to come to a moral and concrete resolve that makes us, hopefully, more united and able to challenge the credible issues facing Canadians. Part of that is ensuring that people have the ability to speak truth to power. As an indigenous member of Parliament from the Prairies, I particularly feel the importance of this issue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733856" data-originallang="en">Several witnesses today have made mention of the critical necessity to challenge some of the very real barriers facing a person's legitimate right to freedom of expression. This was mentioned by the B.C. civil liberties group, for example, which is a champion at the forefront of protecting Canadians' expression rights. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8733857" data-originallang="en">It was mentioned today that there are really two solid groups seeing an extraordinary level of surveillance. Indigenous people, and first nations in particular, are fighting corporate exploitation of their land, whether that's Wet'suwet'en or Fairy Creek. Palestinians are speaking up about their loved ones facing a genocide in Palestine. They need to find ways to express their very legitimate and very deep concerns about how our planet, our earth and our global society are being organized around complicity in that violence.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733858" data-originallang="en">However, to the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association and Ga Grant, your testimony related to some of the real and severe issues being faced when it comes to the types of repression these organizations face, whether they are indigenous or whether they are part of the Palestinian movement. We're seeing police being utilized in very extreme ways. You had to deal with this. Your organization released an arrest handbook and pocketbook. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8733859" data-originallang="en">Can you talk a bit about why the B.C. civil liberties group needed, or felt they needed, to produce such a handbook?</p>
