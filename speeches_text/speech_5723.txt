<p data-HoCid="8756472" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, this is my last speech, so I did that on purpose.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8756473" data-originallang="en"> This includes dental care, an indigenous-led housing program and anti-scab legislation, but I am also proud to be part of a caucus that recognizes we truly live in a climate emergency and there is so much more that has to be done. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8756474" data-originallang="en">I came to the House believing, as most of us do, that we can work together despite our differences to make both Canada and the world a better place. I have worked with MPs from all parties on common initiatives and much of that work was done at the committee level. During my time at the defence committee, over five years, I worked with Liberal chair Stephen Fuhr and the Conservative spokesperson, the member for <a data-HoCid="278158" href="/politicians/james-bezan/" title="James Bezan">Selkirk—Interlake—Eastman</a>, and together we were able to visit Canadian Forces trainers working in Ukraine, members stationed with NATO in Latvia and Canadian peacekeepers in Mali. As well, we managed to send the House more than 20 unanimous reports on how to improve Canada's defences. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8756475" data-originallang="en">I only wish committee work like this would get half the public attention that the theatre that is question period gets from both the media and the public. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8756476" data-originallang="en">Unfortunately, we now live in the midst of a rising tide of hate and violence, and it is more important now than ever that each of us continues to speak out against hatred. I remain appalled by the constant attack on transgender Canadians, especially transgender kids. I am disturbed by the ongoing wave of incidents of anti-Semitism nationally and even in my own riding. Solidarity matters when fighting against hate, whether it is directed toward my community or any other community in this country. As once a new Canadian myself, I will always speak out against attempts to blame newcomers for all our ills. None of this hate, none of this attack on immigrants, none of this attack on transgender people is part of the Canada that most of us have always been so proud to be part of. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8756477" data-originallang="en">While remaining a firm advocate for my riding, the queer community and greater equity in Canadian society, my time in Parliament has always been devoted to finding common ground to advance all Canadians, especially the most marginalized among us. I hope those of us members of Parliament who still believe we can find the common ground necessary to move forward will stand against those who wish to make MPs nothing more than cheerleaders for opposing teams seeking power. There is always a choice for each of us as a member of Parliament, and I am hopeful MPs from all parties will make the choice to rise above these current challenges. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8756478" data-originallang="en">I thank everyone. It has been great to be a colleague of all members and an honour to serve my constituents and all Canadians.</p>
