The community has been calling for this. There is desperation for this. People die when they do not have access to safe, secure and affordable housing. Women die. As we heard from the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>, the issue is also around poverty.</p>

<p data-HoCid="7494290" data-originallang="en">Would she also support the government taking immediate action to realize and implement the 231 calls for justice?</p>
