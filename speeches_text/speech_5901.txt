<p data-HoCid="8785258" data-originallang="en">The State of Israel is carrying out a campaign of genocide against the people of Palestine through indiscriminate military actions against the civilian population, which have killed and maimed more than 100,000 people and have destroyed the physical and social infrastructure of Gaza. Many of the weapons used in this genocide are supplied to the State of Israel by the United States and other NATO countries.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8785259" data-originallang="en">Nickel is an important raw material used in the manufacture of these armaments, and 40% of the nickel consumed in the U.S. originates in Canada. Canadians do not want the natural resources of this land or the labour of our people to contribute to this campaign of terror and mass murder. The government of Canada has banned new contracts for the sale of armaments to Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8785260" data-originallang="en">The petitioners call upon the Government of Canada to institute a ban on the sale of nickel to Israel and to those armament manufacturers that supply Israel. They also would like for us to require purchasers of Canadian nickel to certify that they will not resell Canadian nickel to Israel or to arms manufacturers supplying Israel.</p>
