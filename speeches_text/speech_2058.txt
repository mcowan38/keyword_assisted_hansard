<p data-HoCid="7520327" data-originallang="fr">Thank you very much, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7520328" data-originallang="fr">Thank you for being here, ladies. Your testimony is very relevant to our study.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7520329" data-originallang="fr">Ms. Jeanson, I'm going to piggyback on Ms. Gazan's idea, since it's exactly what I wanted to discuss. However, please let me know if you aren't comfortable and I'll address another topic.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7520330" data-originallang="fr">What you're ultimately saying is that the people around you, both your colleagues in sport and staff members, particularly coaches, and perhaps even your family, have all remained silent or haven't answered any questions in order to spare you any further harm. That's what I understand from your testimony. This isn't the first time I've heard you speak about what you've experienced, since you've also discussed it on the major networks. You were completely abandoned and isolated. It's appalling to hear this today.</p>
