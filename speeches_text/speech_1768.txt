<p data-HoCid="7232507" data-originallang="en">I would echo these concerns about cost. The government is putting considerable funds into this technology right now. I think New Brunswick was in for $86 million over the last few years. I wanted to know more about the timeline. We hear that it will be cheaper energy, because we'll be building it in factories. How many units are we going to have to build before we get to a place where SMRs are cost competitive with wind, solar, hydro and even conventional nuclear? The latter has a real history of cost overruns and expensive power up front. Those solar and wind prices you quoted are much higher than they are elsewhere in the world. I don't want to go down that rabbit hole. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7232508" data-originallang="en">What is the business case for this? How many years will it be? We know the first ones will roll off and be built in 8, 10 or 15 years. How many years will it be before we get to the production levels that will bring those costs down to make it worthwhile?</p>
