<p data-HoCid="8315743" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, I was part of an all-party delegation led by the member for <a data-HoCid="278343" href="/politicians/david-mcguinty/" title="David McGuinty">Ottawa South</a> to the 148th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the global organization of national parliaments founded in 1889. Our Canadian delegation played an important role on a number of fronts, including AI, climate change and the situation in Gaza.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8315744" data-originallang="en">While I was in Geneva, I was privileged to represent Canada at the debate on the resolution entitled, “Partnerships for climate action: Promoting access to affordable green energy, and ensuring innovation, responsibility and equity”. Canada introduced amendments that were accepted during drafting, particularly dealing with more inclusive language to include women, girls, people with disabilities and indigenous peoples.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8315745" data-originallang="en">I would like to extend special thanks to Matthew Pringle from the Library of Parliament. He supported me in successfully having the final resolution reflect Canada's perspective on the importance of parliaments around the world taking decisive action on climate change.</p>
