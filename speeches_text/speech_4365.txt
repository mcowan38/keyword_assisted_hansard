<p data-HoCid="8453839" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8453840" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, minister, for being with us today. I'd like to begin by commending this morning's announcement of the special measures for people in Gaza, which increased the ceiling on temporary resident visa applications from 1,000 to 5,000. We thank you for having made this decision, and want to acknowledge it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8453841" data-originallang="fr">The last time you appeared before the committee, we did indeed discuss what was happening in Gaza. I had also spoken to you about the Bloc Québécois proposal—I was the one who made it—approximately two years ago now, with respect to the IRCC's permanent urgent processing mechanism. You told me at the time that it was in progress, and that a crisis unit was being established, but that parameters had not yet been determined.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8453842" data-originallang="fr">That was two years ago. Two deputy ministers have already told me that it was in fact an excellent idea and that people were working on it. And yet I have not seen any outcome or announcements. All I've heard from people is that they are working on it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8453843" data-originallang="fr">Is this work on it going to continue forever, or is it really going to happen?</p>
