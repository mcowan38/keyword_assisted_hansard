<p data-HoCid="7942226" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the unfortunate and deeply embarrassing events in this House a couple of weeks ago have provided us an important reminder of the need for Holocaust education. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7942227" data-originallang="en">For those of us from metro Vancouver, the work of the Vancouver Holocaust Education Centre in my riding of Vancouver Granville seeks to do exactly this. Through education and remembrance it engages students, educators and the broader public with respect to the history of the Holocaust, the Shoah, and its ongoing relevance.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7942228" data-originallang="en">As a teaching museum that stewards programs and collections initiated by Holocaust survivors, the VHEC honours and supports those who survived and remembers those who perished. Every year, the centre's Holocaust education programs reach British Columbia classrooms, teachers and more than 25,000 students. Its efforts will help build a world free of anti-Semitism, discrimination and genocide.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7942229" data-originallang="en"> I encourage everyone to visit the centre as we each embark on our own journeys of remembrance and education.</p>
