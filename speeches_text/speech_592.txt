<p data-HoCid="6472825" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, the member for <a data-HoCid="252469" href="/politicians/scott-simms/" title="Scott Simms">Coast of Bays—Central—Notre Dame</a> and I enjoyed a long time on the PROC committee in the last Parliament dealing with one of the government motions. There is a Yiddish proverb that says “Men don't build on strange ground.” I want to critique the member's proposal for a second chamber. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6472826" data-originallang="en">Going back to what I said earlier, until we fix debate in this chamber, we should not be setting up a second chamber to simply replicate what already happens here. The member is absolutely right about reading of speeches, when stock documents are given to members to read in the House. We should get it right here first and not repeat in a second chamber what we do here until we correct all of the deficiencies here. I wonder what the member thinks of that.</p>
