<p data-HoCid="8364050" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I have so many reasons to be proud of my alma mater, and today, I rise to share with Canadians just one: International Students Overcoming War, or ISOW, at Wilfrid Laurier University.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8364051" data-originallang="en">ISOW was started by Laurier students in 2014, and in the years since, students have contributed to sponsor refugee and at-risk students living in conflict zones, covering both living and tuition costs for recipients. To date, 34 students have been sponsored from eight different countries, including Somalia and Myanmar, with a 100% graduation rate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8364052" data-originallang="en">My thanks to Dr. Gavin Brockett for his leadership and support of those incredible students. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8364053" data-originallang="en">Let us recognize the powerful impact of initiatives like ISOW and support their work, like a recent proposal that includes supporting women from Gaza, because by helping them, we are helping build a more compassionate future for all. </p>
