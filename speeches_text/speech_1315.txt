<p data-HoCid="6863736" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, today, November 29, is recognized by the United Nations as the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6863737" data-originallang="en">I am proud to recognize this day as the chair of the Canada-Palestine Parliamentary Friendship Group, a group of nearly 50 members of Parliament and senators representing all parties, working together in a shared, non-partisan commitment to peace in the Middle East and advancing the recognition and protection of human rights for the Palestinian people. Canada recognizes the Palestinian right to self-determination and supports the creation of a sovereign, independent, viable, democratic and territorially contiguous Palestinian state, as part of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace settlement.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6863738" data-originallang="en">On this day of solidarity, I call on Canada to do more to help the ordinary Palestinians on the ground who live their daily lives under very difficult circumstances. We wish for a better future for all children.</p>
