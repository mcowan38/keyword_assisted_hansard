<p data-HoCid="8435005" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435006" data-originallang="en">I'd like to echo my colleagues in thanking all of the witnesses for being here to help inform this committee's study. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8435007" data-originallang="en">I found, in the opening statements from all of you, a common thread regarding the need for education and training, particularly with respect to Canada's post-secondary institutions. I want to see if we can turn the committee's attention to students before they get to post-secondary systems. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8435008" data-originallang="en">I had a pretty unique childhood in the 1980s in that I got to live in both Germany and Israel. I lived in Germany from 1982 to 1985. Some of my neighbours were former soldiers in the Wehrmacht, and I came to understand, from a very young age, the country's collective guilt for its role in the Holocaust. Later on, I spent a year living in Israel and, of course, came to know a few Holocaust survivors. I visited the memorial at Yad Vashem. Those two experiences had a profound impact on my life from a very young age and helped me understand the Holocaust and the collective experiences of Jewish people around the world.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435009" data-originallang="en"> Ms. Lyons, I know education is under provincial jurisdiction. However, do you think there is anything this committee could recommend to the federal government about partnering with provincial governments to equip students with the necessary knowledge before they reach post-secondary education institutions, so they may be less susceptible to the hatred that has been so clearly outlined here?</p>
