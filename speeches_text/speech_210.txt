<p data-HoCid="6209735" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6209736" data-originallang="en">I want to speak to the Global Affairs officials who are here todayâ€”whoever could possibly shed light on a question I have.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6209737" data-originallang="en">It relates to an arrangement that's been entered into between Global Affairs Canada, UNICEF and the WHO with respect to COVID-related grants that were issued for projects in Gaza and the West Bank. I'm asking because I just want to make sure that these monies, these Canadian taxpayers' dollars, do not indirectly wind up with organizations that are listed on Canada's terrorist entity list.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6209738" data-originallang="en"> One of the reasons it's a concern is that this has happened before. In 2018-19, Global Affairs granted $1 million to UNICEF, and it somehow wound up with an organization called the Union of Health Workers Committees, which is known as an NGO that is linked to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6209739" data-originallang="en">Could you comment on these concerns and provide us with some assurances that this is not occurring and that the proper mechanisms are in place to ensure that Canadian tax dollars do not wind up in these implementing partners that may have links to organizations on the Canadian terrorist entity list?</p>
