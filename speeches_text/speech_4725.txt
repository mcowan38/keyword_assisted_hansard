<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Before we move on with debate, the Chair wishes to make a statement in regard to the concerns raised earlier today by the member for <a data-HoCid="278368" href="/politicians/heather-mcpherson/" title="Heather McPherson">Edmonton Strathcona</a> about the premature publishing of a tweet on the @HoCChamber X account.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">In her intervention, the member pointed out that the account had prematurely disclosed the conclusions of the Speaker's ruling on the question of privilege raised by the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>. The member stated that it was inappropriate that the conclusions of the ruling would be shared publicly before members of the House were apprised of them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">The Speaker wishes to note that the tweet in question was published in error. According to the process in place, a courtesy advance notice of tweets about rulings is shared with a very small team in the House administration to expedite publication on social media. The instructions are clear: Tweets must never be posted before a ruling is delivered. In this case, the text of the tweet was unfortunately posted as the ruling was being read and not afterwards. To our knowledge, this is the first time this has happened. I should note that at no point is anyone in my office involved in publishing these tweets.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">On behalf of the House administration, the Speaker would like to sincerely apologize for this error. It is very important to the Speaker that members have the first opportunity to hear the conclusions of a ruling. To ensure that such a thing does not happen again, I immediately requested changes to our internal processes on your behalf.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">While I am on my feet, I want to address the strong language that was used after the point of order was raised. The member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre </a>made a significant point for all members to consider, yet used words that were not acceptable on the floor of the House. There are ways to make one's point without resorting to profanity, and I trust that this will not happen again.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">I thank all members for their attention.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">The hon. member for Winnipeg Centre has a point of order.</p>
