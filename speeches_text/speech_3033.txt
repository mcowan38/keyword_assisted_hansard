<p data-HoCid="8040536" data-originallang="en">Okay.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8040537" data-originallang="en"> I'm going to start, then, with Mr. Crosby. We had testimony in another panel from Christyn Cianfarani, who said this with respect to urgent procurement and the ability to procure on a war footing or urgently:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8040538" data-originallang="en"> If [you] want it to happen, it can happen. It will take time for the companies to ramp up to production volume, but if we want it to happen, we need to provide firm contracts for production ramp-up. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8040539" data-originallang="en">We were talking about—among other things—the ability to procure kit that was badly needed in Afghanistan. It was procured quickly and we got the equipment that was necessary because there was a will.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8040540" data-originallang="en"> The frustration that many have is an absence of will from the government right now with respect to things like the 155-millimetre shells and the long delay in, for example, the design of ships. When we had this panel assembled before, there was a fairly strong defence of taking 10 years to design a ship.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8040541" data-originallang="en">In light of the change in world events that has taken place since then, of course, we have the United States diverting 155-millimetre shells to Israel that might have otherwise gone to Ukraine amid a worldwide shortage of this kit.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8040542" data-originallang="en">Can you comment on urgency and assure this committee that there actually exists urgency...? That's for perhaps both Mr. Crosby and Mr. Page.</p>
