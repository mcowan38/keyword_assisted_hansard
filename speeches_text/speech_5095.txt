<p data-HoCid="8628581" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8628582" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Minister, for being with us today. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8628583" data-originallang="en">I am very proud to represent a riding that has a large Jewish community and large institutions of the Jewish community: six synagogues and two Jewish schools. I'm very proud to have in my riding the oldest mosque in British Columbia. I'm very proud to have a vibrant Sikh community. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8628584" data-originallang="en">My parents told me that showing up for your community matters. It's not just about words. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8628585" data-originallang="en">On October 7, I was privileged to attend the remembrance ceremony for victims of October 7. It was interesting to note that not one Conservative member of Parliament showed up. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8628586" data-originallang="en">During Ramadan, I was privileged to be with my community, and it was important to note that not one Conservative member of Parliament showed up to meet with the Muslim community.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8628587" data-originallang="en">Showing up also matters in votes, and I would love your thoughts on this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8628588" data-originallang="en">In Vancouver Granville alone, the Conservative Party members voted against funding for the Vancouver Holocaust Education Centre, which was a specific line item in the budget. They voted against funding for the expansion of the Jewish Community Centre in my riding. They voted against funding for the Hellenic community in my riding. They voted against funding for the Canada community safety program that has affected gurdwara, masjid and Jewish temples in my riding.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8628589" data-originallang="en">What message does it send to Jews, Muslims, indigenous people, Asian Canadians and so many others when Conservatives talk about fighting racism and don't show up where it matters in the votes that matter to Canadians?</p>
