<p data-HoCid="8679276" data-originallang="en">In terms of carrots and sticks, I think we need to recognize that the recognition of Palestine does not prejudice a negotiated settlement, so they do not have to go in lockstep. Again, the view of Spain and Norway for a long period of time was, in fact, that they had to go in lockstep and that recognition could only come at the end of a negotiated process. They have broken with that very belief because they no longer believe that is true. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679277" data-originallang="en">I recognize that we want to stay in lockstep with our G7 allies, but, again, six out of seven are now considering the question that you put. They are basically considering recognizing Palestine before the end of a negotiated settlement, and I think Canada should join in that with them and try to influence when exactly that happens. </p>
