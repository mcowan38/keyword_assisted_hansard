<p data-HoCid="8195466" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the war in Gaza has been devastating to so many innocent civilians. That is why the Canadian government has provided more than $100 million in humanitarian aid, making us one of the top donors in the world.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8195467" data-originallang="en">I was recently disappointed to hear comments made by the Conservative candidate for <a data-HoCid="278589" href="/politicians/yaara-saks/" title="Ya'ara Saks">York Centre</a> saying that any and all aid to Palestinian civilians will somehow fund terrorism, even through the Red Cross. While the Conservatives are indifferent to Palestinian civilian suffering, we will remain steadfast in supporting humanitarian support to Palestinian civilians.</p>
