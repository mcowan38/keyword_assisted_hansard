<p data-HoCid="6928720" data-originallang="en">The final recommendation would be to destigmatize the return of large gatherings. I think we look to our elected officials for guidance about when it is safe to return to arts activities and to gatherings, so it's imperative that the government launch a comprehensive marketing, communications and PR strategy that alleviates the fear and stigma many Canadians will feel upon a return to social events. We need a message of positivity, of respect and of kindness, as many need help getting out of that rabbit hole of the deepest, darkest depths of despair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6928721" data-originallang="en">We will get through this together. I am here and I stand with all my colleagues in the arts sector, including actors, dancers, singers, technicians, musicians, and so on.</p>
