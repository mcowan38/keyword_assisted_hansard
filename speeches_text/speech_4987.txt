<p data-HoCid="8598095" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, on October 7, while burning the maple leaf, Samidoun terrorist sympathizers openly called for “Death to Canada. Death to the United States. And death to Israel”. After nine years of the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, sadly, calls for death to Canada and our allies have now been normalized. Samidoun operates as an arm of a listed terrorist organization in Canada. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8598096" data-originallang="en">Will the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> protect Jewish Canadians from homegrown extremism and list Samidoun as a terrorist organization?</p>
