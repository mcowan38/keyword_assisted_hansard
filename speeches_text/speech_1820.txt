<p data-HoCid="7290554" data-originallang="en">I know there's been local reporting, and we've heard it today, in testimony from the government side referencing a former prime minister, Stephen Harper, being involved. I think there are reports of a former ambassador to Israel also being involved, or at least reported as being involved. Can you speak to the relationship between those within governments who've had perhaps some of the highest levels of security clearance then acting as—and I think you framed it quite rightly—a “mercenary” sector? Can you talk about the dangers of people who have access to top clearances then retiring into this sector, both from elected and civil agencies, but also from some of our highest law enforcement agencies as well?</p>
