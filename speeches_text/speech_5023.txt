<p data-HoCid="8595163" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, on the anniversary of the brutal terrorist attack against Israel on October 7, I rise to present petition e-4985, in which 2,250 Canadians are calling on the government to stand against the rise of anti-Semitism. Bomb threats, death threats, violence, vandalism against Jewish homes, schools and synagogues and the boycotting of Jewish-owned businesses are causing many Jewish Canadians to experience retraumatization of the Holocaust and to feel unsafe in revealing their Jewish ancestry. Jewish homes, schools, synagogues and businesses must be protected. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8595164" data-originallang="en">The petition calls on the House of Commons to enact urgent public and national security measures in line with the Constitution and the Criminal Code of Canada. </p>
