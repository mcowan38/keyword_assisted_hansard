<p data-HoCid="8100408" data-originallang="en">Can somebody tell me what is going on? Am I in a parallel universe, where people who seek to disrupt our democracy remain here, and we're not calling them what they are, which is “terrorists”. Sometimes, you just need to say it, so on point one, I am in support.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100409" data-originallang="en">On point two, “Establish a foreign influence registry”, this is just an absolute no-brainer. Again, we live in a democratic country with democratic values, and we should be spreading those democratic values, but as a democratic country, we should also be valuing the safety and security of our own citizens. A key way to do that is to establish a foreign influence registry.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100410" data-originallang="en">Again, where's the political will here? Where is it? We talk a good game. We say, “Yes, this should happen,” and it just never does. I can't imagine that such legislation would be strongly opposed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100411" data-originallang="en">I'm struck by what happened to Kenny Chiu, a former member of Parliament from Richmond. It was obvious that there was electoral interference when he ran. We can't forget that, for someone in his position, he spent, potentially, years.... I think all of us here spent years getting to where we have to get to, and then, for there to be suspected foreign interference—not even suspected; I think it's been proven that there was at some level, or at least an attempt—and for us to not have a foreign influence registry in those circumstances is at best negligent, at worst reprehensible.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100412" data-originallang="en">Number three is to “[e]valuate Canada's threat assessment in light of the U.K. travel advisory”. This, in my view, again, makes eminent sense. I believe we should be moving on this. It is one of our greatest allies and a partnership that, in my view, we should value. It's another democratic country, which has a global reputation beyond reproach. We should be looking at its travel advisory. Why is the U.K. putting out an advisory on Canada that we in Canada don't concur with? That is, in my view, something that must be addressed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100413" data-originallang="en">Number four is to “[r]emove red tape and speed up access to the security infrastructure program to protect communities at risk”. Again, you will not have issue from me on that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100414" data-originallang="en">Number five is to “[c]reate an anti-hate crime task force to coordinate the protection of faith communities”. I agree with MP Lantsman and what she said. I don't care whether you pray on Friday, Saturday, Sunday or not at all. You should be free to worship, or refrain from worship, however you see fit in this country. I will always stand up for that; Conservatives will always stand up for that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100415" data-originallang="en">I saw that there was an issue with somebody being alleged to have driven their vehicle at people who were protesting on behalf of Palestinians. I denounce that. I similarly denounce people who have targeted restaurants that are Jewish-owned. Those are all things that need to be denounced. In Canada, it shouldn't matter what ethnicity you are or what faith group you belong to. Those people should be free from intimidation, free from harassment and free to worship, or refrain from worship, as they see fit. That is why I am in support of the motion. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8100416" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
