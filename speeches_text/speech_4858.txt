<p data-HoCid="8576323" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I feel an obligation to remind my NDP colleague that defence is not escalation. Since October 7, over 8,000 rockets have been fired at Israel. I would suggest that if people have been silent while those rockets have been fired, they are not advocates for peace but are apologists for a terrorist group.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576324" data-originallang="en">Why have you been silent? I have looked at Hansard. You have mentioned Hezbollah once. You have tweeted about it only once, criticizing Israel when it responded to Hezbollah.</p>
