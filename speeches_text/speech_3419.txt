<p data-HoCid="8178451" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, Palestinian Canadian families are desperate to bring their loved ones to safety in Canada. The rollout of the special immigration measure for Gaza is riddled with problems. People have been rejected without any explanation. Some are rejected then later approved with exactly the same application. Now officials are saying the 1,000 cap has almost been reached, yet many have not received the code from IRCC to move on to the next stage.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8178452" data-originallang="en">What action is the <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">minister</a> taking to clean up this mess, and will he remove the arbitrary cap without further delay to save lives?</p>
