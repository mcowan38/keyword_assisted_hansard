<p data-HoCid="7964402" data-originallang="en"> I call this meeting to order.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7964403" data-originallang="fr">Welcome to meeting number 76 of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Public Accounts. Pursuant to Standing Order 108(2), the committee is undertaking its study of the ArriveCAN application.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7964404" data-originallang="en">Today's meeting is taking place in a hybrid format. Pursuant to the Standing Orders, members are attending in person in the room and remotely using the Zoom application. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7964405" data-originallang="en">I wish to inform the committee that all witnesses and members have been sound-tested for today's meeting and have passed the audio and visual tests.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7964406" data-originallang="en">I just have some brief remarks.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7964407" data-originallang="en">This, of course, is the first parliamentary sitting since the weekend atrocities and killings in Israel by Hamas. Parliament will certainly take this up next week. I'm sure that Parliament will echo Canada's firm condemnation of Hamas's terrorist and satanic violence against innocent civilians. I look forward to that debate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7964408" data-originallang="en">Next, there have been some questions and informal discussions about why this meeting is happening today on a recess week, when we would all prefer to be home in our ridings. The audit that the Auditor General is conducting is in reply to a motion by Parliament. Over the last week, new information has emerged that could very well impact the conduct of that audit, and I thought it noteworthy to hear from parliamentarians about that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7964409" data-originallang="en">Why specifically now and not next week or the week after? Number one, the Auditor General is tabling a series of audits next week, making it very difficult for her to both be here and do that. As well, the ArriveCAN audit is nearing completion, and I wanted to be sure that the Auditor General had a chance to hear from parliamentarians on this before that was done.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7964410" data-originallang="en">Ms. Hogan, of course, is here this morning.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7964411" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much for appearing before us in person. I understand that you have some remarks that you'd like to share with us, so, Ms. Hogan, without further ado, the floor is yours.</p>
