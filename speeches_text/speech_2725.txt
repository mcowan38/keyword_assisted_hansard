<p data-HoCid="7959409" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, in one of their great songs, Beau Dommage sings, “Tous mes cauchemars passent à six heures, à la télévision” or “all my nightmares appear on the six o'clock news”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7959410" data-originallang="fr">Sadly, those words ring true during these terrible times we are living in. Ukraine, Nagorno-Karabakh, Gaza, war is sowing grief and desolation everywhere. No one will come out a winner.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7959411" data-originallang="fr">Who wins when children die? Who wins when the bodies of civilians are strewn across deserted streets, when hospitals or the sick and injured seeking care and refuge are bombed? Who wins? What god rejoices at the death of a child? What government will proudly avenge the death of a grandmother? What cause justifies these tears, this pain and this mourning? Who is proud of humanity?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7959412" data-originallang="fr">Who would look at our spineless approach to the climate crisis next to our fiery determination to kill each other and say, “keep up the good work”?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7959413" data-originallang="fr">I do not know how all of this is going to end and I have no desire to see the outcome of these dark days. I know that humanity must get its act together. I know that we must get our act together. I know one thing: We need to do better.</p>
