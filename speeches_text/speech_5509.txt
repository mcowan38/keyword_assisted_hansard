<p data-HoCid="8672654" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, I want to start by recognizing that the member for <a data-HoCid="299805" href="/politicians/ben-carr/" title="Ben Carr">Winnipeg South Centre</a> used a Yiddish term. I am really pleased that we are using more Yiddish in the chamber.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8672655" data-originallang="en">Will the member join me in kvetching a little and complaining about the government? Almost $400 million was corruptly spent, which is what the documents are related to. What the Auditor General reported was that the figure was based on an incomplete sample of all the projects where the green slush fund board members, in some cases corruptly, directed money to their own companies.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8672656" data-originallang="en">I wonder whether the member could expand on what could possibly have been done if the whole $1 billion had been spent differently. What other projects or initiatives could we have spent on, or what lower taxes or a smaller deficit could we have achieved? I just want to give an expansive opportunity for the member to kvetch with me and complain about Liberal government corruption.</p>
