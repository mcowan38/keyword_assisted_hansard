<p data-HoCid="7988410" data-originallang="en">The government has stated that the State of Israel has the right to defend itself within the laws of armed conflict.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988411" data-originallang="en">Does the government accept that a state's right to defend itself includes a state's right to prosecute the war at a pace and time of its choosingâ€”in other words, to decide when the military action will begin, when it will end and whether there will be a ceasefire?</p>
