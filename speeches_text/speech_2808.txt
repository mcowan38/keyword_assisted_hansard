<p data-HoCid="7988449" data-originallang="en">Certainly we're interested in being part of those conversations about how we can incentivize a two-state solution. Canada has engaged deeply on the Middle East peace process over the years. We've built up an excellent reputation and expertise on some of the final status issues between Israelis and Palestinians, including the refugee file and Jerusalem. We've been outspoken on settlements and a variety of other issues that serve as barriers to peace between the two parties. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7988450" data-originallang="en">We want to be there. We want to be helpful. We are engaging in conversations now to better understand. I would say that it's very premature at this point to think about what the day after looks like in any granularity. This is very raw on all sides and it is ongoing, as well all know, but we want to be part of those conversations, and what that means right now is making sure that we're understanding the preoccupations of each side and the constructive engagement that other players in the region can have, because normalization ultimately needs to be a part of this as well. Israel needs to be secure in its region.</p>
