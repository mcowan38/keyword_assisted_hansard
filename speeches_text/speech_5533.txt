<p data-HoCid="8672201" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, now we know the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>'s real agenda. He wants to distract from all the economic misery he has caused at home, and so he uses divisions here at home. These divisions are as a result of him. Under his leadership, we have seen a 251% increase in hate crimes, firebombings of synagogues, bullets shot at Jewish children's schools, a hundred churches burned and vandalized, and now we see sectarian riots on the streets of Brampton. This never happened before the Prime Minister.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8672202" data-originallang="en">Does the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> take ownership for the divisions he has caused and the violence that has resulted?</p>
