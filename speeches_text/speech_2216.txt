<p data-HoCid="7723033" data-originallang="en">Yes, but having said that, even if it is not external, when I look at what's going on in Afghanistan, it's horrific. It's one of the worst in the world right now in terms of the millions of people there. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7723034" data-originallang="en">My other concern is something that Ms. McPherson brought up at our last meeting: How do we ensure that this legislation is not politicized? How do we ensure that a government can't say they're going to make sure to include Gaza, just as an example, and they're going to ask you to apply, and then they're going to sit on your application for two years so that you're unable to deliver aid? It could be Nigeria. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7723035" data-originallang="en">Through you, Mr. Chair, Ms. McPherson listed a number of countries. Is there anything that we can change in this legislation to ensure that it can't be politicized? </p>
<p data-HoCid="7723036" data-originallang="en">All of you can respond.</p>
