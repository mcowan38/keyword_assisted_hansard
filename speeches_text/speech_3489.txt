<p data-HoCid="8220233" data-originallang="en">We're on a roll so let's try this one on for size. I move:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8220234" data-originallang="en"> That, pursuant to Standing Order 108(2), the committee invite the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and department officials to appear before the committee for two hours to update the committee on the temporary immigration measures initiated in response to the ongoing conflicts in Sudan and Gaza. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8220235" data-originallang="en">With what's going on in Gaza, I think this meeting is absolutely urgent so we can hear from the minister on the special immigration measures. We know there are a lot of issues and problems with the measures. I won't go into all the details here, but suffice it to say that people who have applied have not heard back. They can't get their code in. They are rejected and they don't really know why; it's not made clear to them. Even for those who have gotten the code, we know that no one has actually made it out of Gaza.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8220236" data-originallang="en">This is of utmost importance, as the situation continues to escalate and lives are literally being lost minute by minute as we speak.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8220237" data-originallang="en">The other one, of course, is the Sudan special immigration measure that was announced just before Christmas—quietly, I would say—by the government. There wasn't a whole lot of attention on this, but the issue there is not any less urgent. To my understanding, that quota is filled, so I think it is really important that we get the ministers and officials to speak to our committee about these matters.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8220238" data-originallang="en">After that, Mr. Chair, I will have another motion, but I will wait for this to be completed first.</p>
