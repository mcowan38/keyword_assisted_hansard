<p data-HoCid="8577544" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, tonight, at sunset, marks the beginning of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8577545" data-originallang="en">Rosh Hashanah is one of the most important holidays in the Jewish calendar. This holiday allows family and friends to come together to appreciate the struggles and triumphs of the previous year, as well as to reset and refocus on the year ahead. It is a time of hope and encouragement that has inspired Jewish people for millennia, comforting them even in times of unimaginable hardship.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8577546" data-originallang="en"> Rosh Hashanah is particularly important this year as the Jewish community faces so much uncertainty and hatred. In the 10 days leading up to Yom Kippur, I hope that not only the Jewish community but also all of Canada commits to fighting hatred and anti-Semitism. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8577547" data-originallang="en">To everyone celebrating Rosh Hashanah, I say <em>Shanah tovah u'metuka</em> to them and their family. Canada's Conservatives wish them a peaceful and prosperous new year.</p>
