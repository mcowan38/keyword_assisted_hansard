<p data-HoCid="7783623" data-originallang="fr">My next questions focus more on the local side.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7783624" data-originallang="fr">In my area, we have crabbing and lobstering, both of which are very lucrative. However, in recent years, we have seen crab licences slip out of the region. By region, I mean the administrative area of the Acadian Peninsula, rather than the fishing area, Area 12. Licences are being sold at huge prices, in the order of $12, $15 or $20 million. New Brunswick is losing these fishing licences to other provinces or regions such as Quebec, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island or the Magdalen Islands. What makes this easier is that the residency requirement in New Brunswick is set at only six months, compared to Quebec's requirement, for example, of two years.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7783625" data-originallang="fr">Could one of you explain to me what process would need to be followed to get the residency requirement in New Brunswick changed so that it is similar to other provinces, for example, Quebec or Prince Edward Island, and so that New Brunswick stops losing these licences?</p>
