<p data-HoCid="8299960" data-originallang="en">Chair, I have a few suggestions on what might be included in the letter.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8299961" data-originallang="en">First of all, let's have a clear statement of the purpose of the monument. As the committee is well aware, it is to recognize the commitment and sacrifice of Canadians who served in Afghanistan and the support provided to them at home.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8299962" data-originallang="en">Let's get some details on the location, how the location was chosen and the National Capital Commission's jurisdiction over that location across the street from the war museum, near the National Holocaust Monument.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8299963" data-originallang="en">Let's get some description by the commission of their role. My understanding is that their role is to design and construct monuments. Their experience in the design and construction of other monuments will be brought to bear in connection with this particular one, with perhaps some indication, from similar projects, of lessons learned, their role in the coordination of government departments and the technical support they provide during the design process. Let's get some sense of what they envision in terms of their management of the construction of the monument.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8299964" data-originallang="en">Let's ask for the timeline for construction. It's my understanding that it is to be ready for public viewing in 2027, but a clearer timeline for this committee would be of some assistance. It's also my understanding that the National Capital Commission is charged with the maintenance of the site in the long term, so let's ask for some particulars around that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8299965" data-originallang="en">The National Capital Commission had a role in the design competition. It is the design competition that is the subject of this motion, so let's get a description of their role in the design competition, specifically because their role was a technical one and they are a joint contracting authority. Let's ask for a bit more information on what is involved in being the technical authority and joint contracting authority. “Joint contracting authority” clearly implies some level of collaboration or co-operation, or a joint effort with other parties. It would be good to know who has which roles.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8299966" data-originallang="en">Let's ask how exactly they managed the technical review of the applicants. We know there were five applications. We know the jury arrived at a decision. Then, after broad consultation with the veterans community, there was a decision taken not to accept the jury's recommendation. Let's ask about the role, from a technical perspective, of the National Capital Commission in all of that, if any. If none, let's see exactly what their role was in the technical review of the applicants. We know the review to seek feedback on, if you will, an emotional or a symbolic level was undertaken by government. Clearly, the technical elements of the decision are where you might expect the National Capital Commission to be involved.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8299967" data-originallang="en">Then, let's ask about the various approval processes. There would be technical requirements at the site. There would be technical requirements associated with the use of federal lands, the design and the transaction. They clearly had a detailed role. I think all of those things are pertinent to the committee's examination. As much as there is some controversy and disagreement around the selection of the company or proponent to design the monument, there was also some controversy around the site selection. The National Capital Commission was by necessity intimately involved in the site selection. That is, in fact, their role as the authority for federal lands in the national capital region, so let's get a synopsis from them around the site selection and the process to build the monument.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8299968" data-originallang="en">I'm just trying to paint a picture of the level of detail I think we should be able to expect from someone if they were sitting here and subject to questions from all of us. I hope that sort of information at that level of detail is something we could reasonably expect in a letter coming from them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8299969" data-originallang="en">I offer those suggestions on the mandate that we put forward to the National Capital Commission for the letter we're seeking.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8299970" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
