<p data-HoCid="8564996" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I am rising on a point of order.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8564997" data-originallang="en">I would like to draw your attention, for the benefit of the House, to some language I have heard used that is unbecoming of the House and of members in the House. I have no interest in ascribing blame or pointing fingers, so I am not going to name names. However, there has been reference over the course of debate in the House, in the past few days in particular, to pagers and walkie-talkies exploding and reference to members in the House themselves perhaps having that type of technology, which is an obvious reference to the conflict that is happening in the Middle East right now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8564998" data-originallang="en"> I heard another comment from a member today that asked, “Did you get a thank-you letter from Hezbollah?” This was to an Israeli member of the House who has lost innocent loved ones in the conflict. We have other members of this chamber, from all sides, who have lost innocent people by virtue of the conflict that is taking place.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8564999" data-originallang="en"> I again am not interested in being partisan. I simply want to draw your attention to this, Mr. Speaker, and call upon the better angels in the House to conduct themselves, on behalf of Canadians and one another, with compassion and dignity.</p>
