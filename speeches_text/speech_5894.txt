<p data-HoCid="8778212" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I want to go back to something the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> said in her comments, which was, in life, it does not cost anything to be kind. I just want to thank her for saying that because I, too, go by that adage. It does not cost anything to be kind to another person.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8778213" data-originallang="en">To the member for <a data-HoCid="278613" href="/politicians/matthew-green/" title="Matthew Green">Hamilton Centre</a>, the financialization of housing, whether it is here in Canada or anywhere in the world, is absolutely and utterly wrong. Many of the folks who know me in this place know that I am a big believer in capitalism with guardrails, capitalism with proper governance structure.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8778214" data-originallang="en">When it comes to the financialization of housing, REITs do have a place to play in society, whether it is industrial REITs or commercial REITs and so forth. Landlords do have a role to play in society, of course. At the same time, we are talking about individuals, individuals who need a rooves over their heads and families trying to get ahead in life. If it is through algorithms or the financialization of the housing market, we need to take appropriate measures to stop that and to reverse it.</p>
