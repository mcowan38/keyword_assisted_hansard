<p data-HoCid="7852061" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7852062" data-originallang="en">I'd like to thank you and the committee members for the opportunity to appear before the standing committee this morning to speak about what I would see as an under-examined aspect of health and transition services provided to Canadian Armed Forces personnel and veterans, and that is their spiritual or pastoral care.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7852063" data-originallang="en">While I am not a chaplain and have not provided pastoral care to veterans or armed forces personnel, as an ordained deacon in the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, I regularly provide pastoral care and spiritual direction to men and women from a variety of backgrounds and situations. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7852064" data-originallang="en">I'm also able to speak on these questions given my previous role as Canada's ambassador for religious freedom and my ongoing work in this area.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7852065" data-originallang="en">In the Christian tradition, as well as in the Jewish, Muslim and certain other traditions, we understand that the human being has a tripartite nature composed of a body, mind and soul. Each part works in concert with the other two to ensure a healthy and thriving person.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7852066" data-originallang="en">When the body is weakened by injury or disease, it can impact the psychological well-being of the person. Various forms of psychological distress and mental illness can have impacts on the physical body. Likewise, when a person is experiencing existential crises related to their search for meaning and truth, it can impact the physical and mental aspects of the person as well.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7852067" data-originallang="en">We all confront in our lives certain existential questions such as, who am I? Who am I in relationship to others? Who am I in relationship to the world? Who am I in relationship to God or to an ultimate truth according to a given philosophical tradition? The ongoing wrestling with these questions is part of our humanity.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7852068" data-originallang="en">These questions often come particularly to the fore in times of personal crisis or in times when we place ourselves in harm's way, in conflict, as do the members of the Canadian Armed Forces on a daily basis. All of us are hard-wired to seek meaning, to discover what is true and then to govern our lives according to that truth. In short, we cannot separate out our rational and physical selves from our spiritual self.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7852069" data-originallang="en">Given this reality, it is critical that, in addition to services and treatments that support the physical and mental health of Canadian Armed Forces' personnel and veterans, they also be given access to high-quality care for their spiritual health. The skilled personnel of the Royal Canadian Chaplain Service are at the forefront of providing this care, as well as reflecting the growing religious diversity of the armed forces. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7852070" data-originallang="en">These men and women, both clerical and lay, collectively play an indispensable role in the ongoing spiritual health of our men and women in uniform and after they have left service. Pastoral care is also indispensable to aid in spiritual healing, healing that has beneficial outcomes for the whole person.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7852071" data-originallang="en">In providing essential spiritual care to CAF personnel and veterans, chaplains must be able to provide that care and counsel fully informed by the teachings and beliefs of their particular faith. They must be fully able to exercise their freedom of religion in doing so and thus minister to others in a way that is integrated and authentic, bearing faithful witness to what they confess to be true. This freedom must not be unduly hindered such as through a mandated requirement to adhere to a prevailing secular creed or to conform to a political ideology of any stripe. These religious truths are timeless.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7852072" data-originallang="en">The essential work of armed forces' chaplains of all religious and philosophical traditions must be protected and encouraged, all while upholding freedom of religion and conscience for chaplains and those whom they serve.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7852073" data-originallang="en">As such, I'd like to recommend that this committee and its report on this study call upon the <a data-HoCid="278899" href="/politicians/anita-anand/" title="Anita Anand">Minister of National Defence</a> to firmly and publicly reject the discriminatory sections of recommendation 6, “Re-Defining Chaplaincy”, contained in the April 25, 2022, final report of the Minister of National Defence’s advisory panel on systemic racism and discrimination.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7852074" data-originallang="en"> Further, this standing committee could recommend that all Canadians, regardless of their religious or philosophical tradition, whether that be theistic, secular humanist or atheistic, be supported through the pastoral services of CAF chaplains as they serve our country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7852075" data-originallang="en">I would also recommend the establishment of a permanent committee of religious leaders who report jointly to the <a data-HoCid="278899" href="/politicians/anita-anand/" title="Anita Anand">Minister of National Defence</a> and to the chaplain general on an annual basis regarding the integrity of the Royal Canadian Chaplain Service. Among its principal roles, the permanent committee would serve as a consultative body to ensure and promote ways of advancing and maintaining the religious diversity with the service, serve as an arm's-length representative body of religious leaders and investigate and report on violations of the freedom of religion or conscience within the service.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7852076" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
