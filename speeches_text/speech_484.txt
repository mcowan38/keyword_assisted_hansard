<p data-HoCid="6403276" data-originallang="en">You can be a steadfast ally as Canada is of Israel, and at the same time reaffirm, in a resolution, the right of the Palestinian people for self-determination. We all want a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East, and having a Palestinian state living side by side with Israel where both peoples can live in security, dignity, and safety.
