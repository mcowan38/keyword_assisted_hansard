<p data-HoCid="6376161" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Ms. Gazan. We're out of time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6376162" data-originallang="fr">Is Ms. Chabot still there?</p>
<p data-HoCid="6376163" data-originallang="fr">No. All right.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6376164" data-originallang="en">Colleagues, we have some committee business to attend to, and we have about 14 minutes left in our allocated time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6376165" data-originallang="en">I'm going to take this opportunity to offer a sincere thank you to the witnesses. This is obviously a vast study that impacts many departments. We appreciate the patient and professional way in which you've answered the questions today. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6376166" data-originallang="en">In the COVID era we—you knew it all along, but I think Canadians generally and parliamentarians especially—have developed a renewed appreciation for what you do. Thank you for being with us today, and thank you for your service to your country. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6376167" data-originallang="en">I wouldn't be surprised if we were to come back to you once we get some of the answers that you've committed to provide us in writing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6376168" data-originallang="en">Thank you to all the witnesses. You're free to go, but you're welcome to stay. We're going to move now to committee business.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6376169" data-originallang="en">Colleagues, we're moving now to committee business, although we are not in camera; we're still in public, so that you know. There are a couple of matters that we want to deal with.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6376170" data-originallang="en">First of all, in terms of the schedule going forward, you will have received a notice of meeting for our next meeting, with a short witness list. That's because there are still witnesses to be confirmed, but they are coming from the lists that have been submitted by the parties in furtherance of the study we have started today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6376171" data-originallang="en">Next week we will have <a data-HoCid="253379" href="/politicians/filomena-tassi/" title="Filomena Tassi">Minister Tassi</a> and <a data-HoCid="253377" href="/politicians/deb-schulte/" title="Deb Schulte">Minister Schulte</a> on supplementary estimates. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6376172" data-originallang="en">That's the plan for the next three meetings.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6376173" data-originallang="en">The one thing in particular that we need the committee's guidance on today is that we received a letter from the Parliamentary Budget Officer on November 2 outlining a proposed scope for the PBO's assistance with the study. What I require is some feedback from the committee and ideally a formal motion as to what our response to the Parliamentary Budget Officer should be. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6376174" data-originallang="en">Are we happy with the scope that has been provided, or do you wish to make a response or delegate me to do so? That's the question and the main reason for setting aside some time for committee business.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6376175" data-originallang="en">Would you please use the “raise hand” function to give any comments with respect to the scope of the involvement of the Parliamentary Budget Officer and ideally to put forward a motion for direction?</p>
<p data-HoCid="6376176" data-originallang="en">Mr. Kent.</p>
