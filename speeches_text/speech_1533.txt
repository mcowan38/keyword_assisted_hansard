<p data-HoCid="7082825" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7082826" data-originallang="en">I'd like to ask this question of both of the witnesses. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7082827" data-originallang="en">Maybe I'll start with Ms. Vallée. L'R's “Basis of Political Unity” identified that poverty is connected to unpaid care work and government social policies that “prefer to reduce social spending rather than redistributing wealth and creating stable jobs.” We know from research that raising living standards and moving individuals out of poverty is one of the key ways to address intimate partner violence. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7082828" data-originallang="en">My colleague <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Leah Gazan</a> has put forward a bill for a guaranteed livable basic income to ensure that individuals and families doing unpaid work can have economic autonomy and opportunities to leave harmful living situations. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7082829" data-originallang="en">Would you agree that this is a fundamental step for the government to take to lift individuals out of poverty?</p>
