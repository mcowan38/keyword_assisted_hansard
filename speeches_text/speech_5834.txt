<p data-HoCid="8778473" data-originallang="en"> Madam Speaker, I rise to present a dissenting report by the Conservative Party on the study on Islamophobia. The study was undertaken at a time of conflict in the Middle East between Israel and the Palestinian people of Gaza. As one witness noticed, the committee suffered from a fundamental category error by confusing Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian racism. We agreed with that assessment. Indeed, nine of the 13 recommendations make reference to anti-Palestinian racism. We do not think that this shift in attention away from the main topic of Islamophobia was helpful in identifying the challenges that Canadians face with the rise of Islamophobia. Our dissenting report reflects that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8778474" data-originallang="en">I have a second dissenting report, on the study of anti-Semitism. Multiple witnesses testified that diversity, equity and inclusion programs on their campuses have discriminated against Jewish people. In response, the majority of the committee proposed addressing this issue by expanding these diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives to ensure that Jewish voices are heard. Conversely, the Conservative members of the committee viewed this testimony as evidence that, despite good intentions, these programs are ineffective. Our dissenting report reflects that sentiment.</p>
