<p data-HoCid="8667197" data-originallang="en"> I can only understand the methodology of the report from what the report says is its methodology.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8667198" data-originallang="en">The report states, “On November 13, 2023, TikTok issued a letter defending itself against accusations of anti-Israel and anti-Jewish bias”—which is something that I've actually been in discussions with TikTok on, and I agree that TikTok is doing its best to try to confront that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8667199" data-originallang="en">The report continues, “TikTok prolifically compares relative hashtags between its platform and Instagram to buttress its argument. We have replicated TikTok’s methodology”—that is in this letter of November 13, 2023—“to assess whether anomalies exist regarding the relative representation of issues on TikTok vs. Instagram.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8667200" data-originallang="en">The methodology they used in the study that you say is debunked is actually the same methodology that you used in that letter that was sent to disprove something else.</p>
