<p data-HoCid="6679691" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, in 2018, this House unanimously passed a bill making the month of May Canadian Jewish Heritage Month.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6679692" data-originallang="en">As a Jewish Canadian, I am proud to join the House today in celebrating the incredible contributions of the Jewish community to our great country.
