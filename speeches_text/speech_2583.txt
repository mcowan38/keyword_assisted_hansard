<p data-HoCid="7964463" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7964464" data-originallang="fr">Madam Auditor General, thank you for being with us today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7964465" data-originallang="fr">I would like to take this opportunity to offer my condolences to the victims of Hamas, a terrorist group. In this conflict that has gone on for too long, our thoughts are with the innocent victims on both the Palestinian and Israeli sides.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7964466" data-originallang="fr">Madam Auditor General, my first question relates to a comment your office made to the Globe and Mail to the effect that you can't reveal any results until the audit is tabled. That's obvious and I understand that very well. However, I would like to understand the process that allows you, for example, to contact the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the RCMP, if you find that potentially illegal or criminal acts have been committed.</p>
