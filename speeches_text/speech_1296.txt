<p data-HoCid="6901032" data-originallang="en">First, on Paxlovid, the Pfizer treatment, that's indeed very, very good news. It's not the whole story; it's one tool in our tool box. I would inform the members of the committee that we are not only approving but also delivering these treatments along with very few other countries in the world. Only Israel, the United States and South Korea are as equally successful as we are. The United Kingdom will soon receive treatment courses, but we are really very much at the top of the league.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6901033" data-originallang="en">When it comes to assisting provinces and territories in doing what they need to do, as I said earlier, we've sent $63 billion in in-kind transfers or in monetary transfers to help provinces and territories in the difficult environment in which they need to work.</p>
