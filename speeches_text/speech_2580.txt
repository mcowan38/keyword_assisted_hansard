<p data-HoCid="7955193" data-originallang="en">This is why I really like your report. It's really a snapshot on something that we've been trying to measure for a long time. I'm down the rabbit hole on this stuff, being an advocate for the investment in auto.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7955194" data-originallang="en">For example, in 1987, when the government of the day rescued Chrysler, we actually made millions of dollars off that. When GM was assisted most recently, and Stellantis, if we'd kept our shares in GM, we would have made a lot more money, but the government sold them. It was not your government; the Conservatives sold them. We would have made more money on the shares there too, so there was investment capacity there by saving them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7955195" data-originallang="en">I'd like to know, specific to this study, if there are things that, when you look back, you would do differently. Now that you've heard some criticism out there and you've heard about some strengths, are there things you would maybe do differently to measure it in the future?</p>
