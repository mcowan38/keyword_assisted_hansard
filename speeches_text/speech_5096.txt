<p data-HoCid="8628590" data-originallang="en"> I'd like to thank my honourable colleague for his question and for always being very pragmatic and always bringing people together. It's something I think we all fundamentally believe in, and we are lucky to have such members in our caucus. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8628591" data-originallang="en">When you talk about the work that we're doing to combat anti-Semitism in this country, you're absolutely right. We as a government have been very deliberate about making that choice to invest in Canadians by listening to Canadians. On some of the funding that you talked about, the Conservatives voted against it, which is shameful. This came from the recommendations on the summits that we held on combatting anti-Semitism. This came from the communities that said they needed to have support, and they voted against it. You're absolutely right. Millions of dollars for the first ever special envoy, Deborah Lyons, to fight anti-Semitism and to preserve Holocaust education.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8628592" data-originallang="en">We made sure that this position exists within the Government of Canada because we know how much it matters. There was $25 million for a new Montreal Holocaust museum, which you alluded to, that they voted against. There was $5 million for the first ever national Holocaust remembrance program within our anti-racism strategy that is going directly for education around Holocaust remembrance to make sure that it never happens again in this country and to make sure that we're supporting communities on the ground like funding for the Holocaust Education Centre, which we know is fundamental to talking about the work that needs to happen on the ground. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8628593" data-originallang="en">It's always a bit rich to hear the Conservatives say anything, because they're all about slogans; they're not about solutions. We know that these things take time. It is deliberate work, and we need to work alongside community members with partners on the ground, but we have seen them time and time again vote against and cut funding for these very organizations that the Jewish community has asked for that they have voted against. It's quite frankly shameful.</p>
