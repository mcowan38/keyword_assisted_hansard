<p data-HoCid="6627830" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6627831" data-originallang="en">Thank you, witnesses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6627832" data-originallang="en">I want to continue with the conversation we were just having that Ms. Gazan brought up.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6627833" data-originallang="en">We, as legislators, have to examine every piece of legislation—not every piece of legislation is perfect—and we have to vote yes or no on the words of the legislation. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6627834" data-originallang="en">We have seen many organizations come forward that are concerned about the lack of a definition of FPIC.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6627835" data-originallang="en">Mr. Obed, I want to clarify—and I appreciate your comments—whether the ITK is satisfied that if Bill <a data-HoCid="11007812" href="/bills/43-2/C-15/" title="An Act respecting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">C-15</a> were to pass, it would meet the UNDRIP requirement found in article 19?</p>
