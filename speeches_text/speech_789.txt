<p data-HoCid="6554741" data-originallang="fr">Madam Speaker, today I wish to pay tribute to Maurice Cohen, a great Saint-Laurent man who passed away on March 5. Maurice Cohen was a man of the people and loved by all for his availability, his congeniality and his sympathetic ear. I will be forever thankful for his support and kindness. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6554742" data-originallang="fr"> He was borough councillor for Saint-Laurent for 35 years, never hesitating to stand up for the interests of the people of Saint-Laurent. Known for his involvement in the Jewish community, Mr. Cohen co-founded the province's first francophone Jewish public school, École Maïmonide de Montréal, and later the Petah Tikva Community Centre. Maurice Cohen was a caring and active man and will always be a role model and a source of inspiration to me and many others in Saint-Laurent. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6554743" data-originallang="fr">On behalf of myself and the House, I offer my deepest condolences to his wife Raymonde, his children, Jacques, Gilles, and Thierry, and his entire family. Let us remember Maurice Cohen for all the good he brought—</p>
