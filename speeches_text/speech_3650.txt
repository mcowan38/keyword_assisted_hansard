The year was 1940. Five years later, they were dead, killed by Hitler and the Nazis and his brutal genocidal machine.</p>

I wonder why the member would not have insisted that this motion be balanced, that it require accountability on the part of Hamas, that Hamas surrender, lay down its arms, turn over all the hostages and surrender all the terrorists for prosecution in Israel for their war crimes.</p>
