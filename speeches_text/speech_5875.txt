<p data-HoCid="8829273" data-originallang="en"> Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8829274" data-originallang="en">I just want to mention that we have talked about this motion before. I'm not opposed to talking about it again, but I have an amendment that I would like to make to it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8829275" data-originallang="en">I think six meetings is too many, so my thinking is that if we had one meeting for one of the ministers, a second meeting for the second minister and then a meeting on Sudan and a meeting on Gaza, that might be sufficient.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8829276" data-originallang="en">I'm going to propose two changes. First, I'd like where it says “no less than six” to become “no less than four”. Also, at the end, where we're talking about the production of documents, I want to specifically add in a Sudan piece. After the section that says, in English, near the bottom of the motion, “and the information requested from applicants on additional screening forms”, I would like to add the following words: “as well as documents related to the development of the Sudan humanitarian program and the family permanent residency pathway”. Then we'd continue on with “that, while respecting s. 19”, etc.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8829277" data-originallang="en">There are two things: changing “six” to “four” and adding in a piece on Sudan to the production of documents section. That's my amendment.</p>
