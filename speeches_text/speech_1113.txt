<p data-HoCid="6791915" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791916" data-originallang="en">I wanted to start by making a comment that has been brought up about the issue of Palestinian elections. I believe very much that Palestinian self-determination involves Palestinians choosing their own representatives. The implication of what some have been saying is that you can't have elections unless there are ideal conditions in terms of voting in all parts of the claimed territory, but if that were the practice in general, there would be no elections happening in Ireland, in Cyprus and in many other places.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791917" data-originallang="en"> In fact, the Central Tibetan Administration just held elections, even though Tibet remains fully under CCP occupation and the CTA doesn't have any official access to Tibet whatsoever. I would just submit that if the CTA can hold elections, the Palestinian Authority could hold elections. Nations of people seeking independence should begin the process of nation building without delay, and effective nation building requires democratic elections.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791918" data-originallang="en">To our witnesses, I'm very concerned about the political human rights and humanitarian situation in Gaza, so I want to ask a few questions that relate to that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791919" data-originallang="en">During the conflict, Al Jazeera reported that an important humanitarian corridor, the Kerem Shalom border crossing, was subject to a mortar attack by Hamas and was shut down for a period of time. This obviously had significant negative impacts in terms of the ability to get humanitarian supplies into Gaza.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791920" data-originallang="en">Can you confirm whether this humanitarian corridor was indeed attacked by Hamas? Do you have any sense of why Hamas would have attacked a humanitarian corridor like this?</p>
