<p data-HoCid="8658656" data-originallang="en"> Yes, there is definitely systemic discrimination within the context. The previous speaker also referred to this in terms of the disparities in the responses. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8658657" data-originallang="en">I think we also need to recognize, however, that the program for Ukrainians was a temporary visa program. It was not a permanent resettlement program. The Sudanese program is a resettlement program. It's a program that's bringing people here permanently.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8658658" data-originallang="en">That said, I agree with you that it's unfair to place the burden on families who already are working, in many cases, lower-wage jobs in Canada and then need to find the funds in order to rescue their families to come over from Sudan. We should also be opening up a government-assisted refugee program. We should also be considering temporary visas, as we did for Ukrainians, for other displacement contexts. Currently, the only other context where we're considering this is Gaza. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8658659" data-originallang="en">We can think about other protracted conflicts in other places and we could be thinking about a humanitarian visa, which would allow more people to come to Canada temporarily, as we did with the Ukrainians.</p>
