<p data-HoCid="8722844" data-originallang="en">We know that an immediate ceasefire is urgently needed. Hostages must be released. Hamas must lay down its arms. More aid must get into Gaza. The violence must stop.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8722845" data-originallang="en">I find it really disturbing that on an issue as important and serious as this, I am being heckled by the Conservative Party of Canada.</p>
