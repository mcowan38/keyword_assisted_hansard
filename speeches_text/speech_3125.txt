<p data-HoCid="8071632" data-originallang="fr">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8071633" data-originallang="fr">I want to look at this issue holistically. The question is for everyone.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8071634" data-originallang="fr">I would invite Mr. Jenkins to answer first on the situation of children with disabilities, particularly in war-torn countries. Let's talk about Ukraine, about Afghanistan, where it has been difficult. We could even talk about Gaza, where the situation is extremely difficult for children. We see it and it is intolerable.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8071635" data-originallang="fr">Do we know anything about access to education for children with intellectual or other disabilities? We already know that access in Gaza is complicated.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8071636" data-originallang="fr">If you have any data on those specific situations, Mr. Jenkins or another witness, I would like to know what it is.</p>
