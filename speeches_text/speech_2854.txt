<p data-HoCid="7988261" data-originallang="en"> We are working with our partners in the region, with the Egyptian government, with the Israeli government, with international organizations and with other key partners internationally to impress on the parties to this conflict the need to be able to get life-saving humanitarian access in, including access to water. That would include starting up again the capacity of Gaza to produce purified water as well as bringing in tanks of water, which is one of the efforts that's being made by humanitarian organizations now at Rafah. </p>
