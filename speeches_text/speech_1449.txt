<p data-HoCid="6944681" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I want to carry on with the point that was made by my colleague from <a data-HoCid="278731" href="/politicians/melissa-lantsman/" title="Melissa Lantsman">Thornhill</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6944682" data-originallang="en">When comments made in the House are injurious, insulting and unparliamentary, they rise to the level of a question of privilege. As you know, you have the ability to rule on that immediately.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6944683" data-originallang="en">I will not even go into the hypocrisy of a man who did blackface so often that he cannot remember it accusing somebody else of doing anything remotely racist. However, his comments made to a Jewish member of the House are beyond unparliamentary. They are reprehensible. I ask that you rule that this rises to the level of a question of privilege. I am prepared to move the appropriate motion.</p>
