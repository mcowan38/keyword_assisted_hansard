<p data-HoCid="8479394" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479395" data-originallang="fr">As I was saying, I thank all the witnesses for being with us today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479396" data-originallang="fr">Anti窶全emitism is an important, even major, concern for all of Quebec and Canada. Personally, I'm delighted to learn more about the Islamic religion and the lives of Muslims in Canada. Your testimonials will certainly help us.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479397" data-originallang="fr">We've just conducted a study on anti窶全emitism. This has enabled us, in my case at least, to learn a great deal about the Jewish religion and the various challenges facing the Jewish community in Canada. This morning, I'm learning about the challenges you face. I find these lessons very valuable. So thank you for being here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479398" data-originallang="fr">I have a question for Mr. Islam.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479399" data-originallang="fr">As I understand from the testimony we've heard so far, people feel fear when they walk in the streets, go to school or go to public places. Ms. Al窶全abawi and a few other witnesses mentioned this to us today. This is important.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479400" data-originallang="fr">The question I have is: Should we treat different forms of discrimination and the challenges they pose in the same way? Let's think about Islamophobia, anti窶全emitism, racism based on nationality or skin colour, or discrimination against LGBTQ groups, for example. Should we treat all these problems in the same way, or should we consider different solutions in the case of Islamophobia, since the challenges are different?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479401" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Islam, I'd like to hear your opinion on this matter.</p>
