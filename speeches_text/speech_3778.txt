<p data-HoCid="8300412" data-originallang="en">Okay.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300413" data-originallang="en">More specifically, regarding Gaza and the Palestinian people who are living in the strip and the program that you're here for today, on your website it says this:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8300414" data-originallang="en"> After entering Canada, in most cases you can stay for up to 3 years as a temporary resident, as long as your passport and biometrics are valid for the entire time. If your passport or biometrics expire in less than 3 years, your status as a temporary resident will expire at the same time. You can apply to extend your status before it expires, but you need to make sure your passport and biometrics are up-to-date before you apply. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8300415" data-originallang="en">I have questions about that statement. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8300416" data-originallang="en">First, is the Israeli-issued identification card valid for Gazans in lieu of a passport for the purposes of this program?</p>
