<p data-HoCid="8369794" data-originallang="en">I agree 100% with Mr. Fortin on the need to hear from the <a data-HoCid="299999" href="/politicians/arif-virani/" title="Arif Virani">minister</a>. There's recognition by the Supreme Court that simply eliminating section 43 puts teachers and parents at risk. There's an acknowledgement from the Minister of Justice, apparently. We've heard through Mr. Maloney and the parliamentary secretary that he, too, recognizes there is risk in eliminating section 43. He has, we understand, suggested he would be bringing in legislation. For us to properly proceed on this private member's bill requires us to know what that legislation looks like. It also requires us to know the timing around the coming into force of this legislation and the other legislation, should they both pass.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8369795" data-originallang="en">I want to make one thing 100% clear: This bill is extremely problematic. There has been much concern raised by committee members and especially by witnesses and the Supreme Court. We had a big surprise dropped on us on Monday when we heard that the <a data-HoCid="299999" href="/politicians/arif-virani/" title="Arif Virani">Minister of Justice</a> acknowledges that this is a problematic bill and will be bringing in, presumably, government legislation. I agree that we should, as we scheduled, quickly move to our study on anti-Semitism on Monday. This bill is not ready. The committee has not heard from the minister. The committee has not heard from departmental officials on the content of the new justice legislation that may be coming to respond to the fallout from this bill.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8369796" data-originallang="en">I want to make it extremely clear that we should be moving on, on Monday, regardless of what happens with Bill <a data-HoCid="11471427" href="/bills/44-1/C-273/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (Corinneâ€™s Quest and the protection of children)">C-273</a>, which is a flawed bill that's out of touch with teachers and parents in this country. Regardless of what happens with it, we need to move on with our agenda. Our agenda should be that, on Monday, we begin Mr. Housefather's study on anti-Semitism. Look at your phone, look at the headlines and turn on the television. You will see that this is a massive issue across the country right now. That's why we have agreed as a committee, unanimously, to study Mr. Housefather's motion. I believe we should be studying Mr. Housefather's motion on Monday.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8369797" data-originallang="en">I think we should all be in agreement on that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8369798" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, I am moving a motion at this time that we begin our study on Mr. Housefather's motion on anti-Semitism on Monday and Thursday of next week. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8369799" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
