<p data-HoCid="6165486" data-originallang="en">First, I would like to say that there has been a pandemic of violence against indigenous women and girls for as long as this country has been in Confederation, and that pandemic did not receive any licence from government until the national inquiry. The failure to act on the calls to justice from the national inquiry has provided licence to individuals across the country, whether it be in domestic partnerships or in trafficking situations, to continue to devalue the lives of indigenous women and girls. That needs to be said.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6165487" data-originallang="en">Second, on your question about the 24-7 low-barrier safe space, what a safe space looks like is that it's not constrained by the barriers of shelters, which are generally for people in domestic relationships. A low-barrier safe space would be available for people who are not in domestic situations: LGBTQII individuals, people who are homeless, or people who are trafficked. Those individuals, today, cannot access a shelter.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6165488" data-originallang="en">Also, we know that violence is not limited to indigenous women and girls. It's across the country and across ethnicity. We want to ensure that safe space in Winnipeg is inclusive of all women and women-identifying individuals. </p>
