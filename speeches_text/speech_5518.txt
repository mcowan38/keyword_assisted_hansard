<p data-HoCid="8732779" data-originallang="en"> Okay. Good. Thank you. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8732780" data-originallang="en">It was just a simple motion to extend for 30 days. That motion was made 30 days ago. How many meetings have we had since then where we could have had witnesses? Now we have another 11 hours and still no witnesses here. I think the Liberals are just playing games. I don't know what their endgame is here or what their objective is, but we're just wasting a lot of time. It's an unproductive use of this committee's efforts. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8732781" data-originallang="en">To pick up where I left off, in response to that motion for an extension of 30 days, I was going through the schedule of events of this committee for the last six months. I was trying to understand how we got to this point where we are now in a crisis where we need an extension of 30 days to deal with our business. Why didn't we deal with it before? </p>
<p data-HoCid="8732782" data-originallang="en">For the benefit of those who are new to this committee today, the private member's bill that is the subject of the debate, once we get going on it and once we get witnesses here, will be Bill <a data-HoCid="11714011" href="/bills/44-1/C-270/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (pornographic material)">C-270</a>, which was referred to this committee on May 8. That was six months ago. Why do we need another 30 days? What are we going to do in those 30 days that we couldn't have done in the six months that have passed in the meantime? </p>
<p data-HoCid="8732783" data-originallang="en">I won't belabour the point, but I'll be giving a little bit of background to those who weren't part of the discussion yesterday. I'm doing it for the benefit of those who are gracing us with their presence today. I really appreciate all of them coming, from all sides of the House. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8732784" data-originallang="en">On May 8, we were engaged in two very important studies. One was on anti-Semitism; the other was on Islamophobia. The anti-Semitism study was on a proposal from the Liberals. On the Conservative side of this table, we agreed to that. We thought it was very important, given what was happening, particularly on university campuses. </p>
