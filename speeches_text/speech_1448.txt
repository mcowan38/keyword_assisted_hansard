<p data-HoCid="6944662" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am a strong Jewish woman, a member of the House and a descendant of Holocaust survivors. This has never been singled out and I have never been made to feel less, except for today, when the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> accused me of standing with swastikas.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6944663" data-originallang="en">I think he owes me an apology. I would like an apology, and I think he owes an apology to all members of the House.</p>
