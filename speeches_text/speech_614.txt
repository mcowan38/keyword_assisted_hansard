<p data-HoCid="6468378" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I am here today to present petition e-2740 on Holocaust education, with 747 signatures, including those of former prime ministers Joe Clark and Paul Martin.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6468379" data-originallang="en">The petitioners are concerned about increasing anti-Semitism, and the fact that there are fewer survivors alive to tell the stories about the horrors of the Holocaust to young people. They are calling for increased investment in Holocaust education, research and remembrance, especially to reach young people, and also funding to preserve the testimony of survivors.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6468380" data-originallang="en">It is particularly fitting that I am presenting this petition today, on International Holocaust Remembrance Day.</p>
