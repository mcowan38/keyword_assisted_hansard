<p data-HoCid="8434928" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8434929" data-originallang="en"> Thank you for joining us today, all of you, and for spending some time on this issue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8434930" data-originallang="en">Ms. Lyons, I'm just going to start by asking a couple of questions with some examples that I have here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8434931" data-originallang="en">The Canadian Foreign Service Institute either produces or shares with the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development what I see here as about 80 pages of training materials on anti-racism. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8434932" data-originallang="en">I'll start specifically with Global Affairs Canada. I know that you have a long, esteemed career at foreign affairs. However, in 80 pages of anti-racism, with all of the terms you can imagine and all of the sort of myths and facts—which, frankly, in my opinion, in some cases, invert history—there is not a single mention of anti-Semitism in any of these documents.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8434933" data-originallang="en">Do you really think that the Government of Canada can combat anti-Semitism if it fails to mention it in its own anti-racism training documents?</p>
