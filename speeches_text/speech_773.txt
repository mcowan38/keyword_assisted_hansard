<p data-HoCid="6627713" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6627714" data-originallang="en">I really appreciate everybody being here. Thank you for your leadership. Thank you for your guidance. Thanks for your recommendations. I'm quite in awe of the work you've all done.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6627715" data-originallang="en">To my colleague MP Gazan, on your comment regarding disagreeing, I find myself sitting here and agreeing with you all the time. I hope it's mutual. I pretty much agree with you on this issue and most others almost all the time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6627716" data-originallang="en">That said, there are some things that I've disagreed with and that I think a lot of us have disagreed with. I'm hoping that you can emphasize some of the mischaracterizations or a little bit of the co-opting of ambiguities that I don't think really exist. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6627717" data-originallang="en">My question is perhaps for Madam Turpel-Lafond—I could tell she was anxious to answer the previous one, so I'll just give her the floor there—or really for whomever would like to take it. The question is about two things. That's the co-opting or sort of mischaracterization of an indigenous perspective as somehow unanimous, and the continual mis-characterization of FPIC as being a veto or a roadblock in the way of progress.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6627718" data-originallang="en">I'll let you take it from there.</p>
