<p data-HoCid="8734217" data-originallang="en">Thank you for raising that. At the end of this—we're scheduled to end around two o'clock—and over the course of the weekend, there were plans to launch a protest at what for a long time was my kids' school, Sir Robert Borden, here in Ottawa. That was called off. They're instead going to apparently protest an MPP, but the notion of potentially protesting while kids are in school, as young as 12 years old, raises significant concerns. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8734218" data-originallang="en">We've seen it at community centres. We have seen it in cities on a number of issues, not just with respect to anti-Semitism, which has, as I note, been by far the largest target in terms of hate crime in Canada over the last couple of years, especially since October 7. I know that Mississauga is also considering this, and they're considering it not out of that issue but out of other community members where we have seen tensions and some of this protest.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8734219" data-originallang="en">I think that this, alongside the decision that we saw coming out of the encampments at the University of Toronto, seeks to have a balance in the same way the professor mentioned earlier. We have to find a way to allow people to protest, but when that endangers others, when it creates genuine fear that limits their own expression rights and even limits their own safety, it is, I think, inappropriate. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8734220" data-originallang="en">We heard earlier that there is often a need to strike a balance. How do we ensure that people enjoy those protest rights but that at the same time others feel safe in their communities, in their places of worship and in their schools? Bubble zone legislation allows for those protests to continue but ensures the safety of many others. That's been sorely lacking in many communities for the last number of months across the country.</p>
