<p data-HoCid="6711371" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair. It's interesting to see you in a different committee today. We spend a lot of time in the veterans affairs committee together.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6711372" data-originallang="en">Thank you, everyone. I'm very pleased to see that a study on seniors is happening. That's such an important issue and we know the challenges that seniors have faced. As I am here on behalf of Madam Gazan, I want to move the notice of motion that she put forward on May 4.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6711373" data-originallang="en">If the chair is willing for this to happen right now, I'm happy to move:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="6711374" data-originallang="en"> That, pursuant to Standing Order 108(2), the committee undertake a study on guaranteed livable basic income as a significant and meaningful measure to address the post-pandemic economic recovery, eradicate poverty, strengthen Canada’s social safety net, and ensure the respect, dignity and security of all persons in respect of Canada’s domestic and international legal obligations; that this study shall take no less than three meetings, and that the committee report its findings and recommendations to the House. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="6711375" data-originallang="en">I would hope to see that study after the seniors study.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6711376" data-originallang="en">I will leave it to you, Chair.</p>
