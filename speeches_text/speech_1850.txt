<p data-HoCid="7331082" data-originallang="en">That's great. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7331083" data-originallang="en">When we're looking at mental health—and back to Ms. Todd, when she was talking about prevention—I think your app, Blue Guardian, can be a really critical piece of that prevention, because when we have a language and we're able to identify a feeling or an emotion, then we can move forward. Half the problem is that a parent isn't speaking the same language as the child, so there's this big barrier. As a result, you're basically not able to connect. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7331084" data-originallang="en">The other aspect would be resilience and grit. These are the key components that we need to teach our children. With social media, none of this stuff is ever going to go away, so how do we instill resilience and grit? It would be great to see a next level of Blue Guardian teach that: This is how you're feeling, so how do we now instill resilience and grit, and how do we manage those feelings?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7331085" data-originallang="en">Mental health first aid should also be on the record, when we talk about Ms. Todd and prevention. I think it should be key for all of that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7331086" data-originallang="en">Some of the push-back may be from people who don't feel apps are trustworthy in terms of data collection, which I know Ms. Gazan touched on. Does it read your facial expressions? We know that this is one of the most powerful ways to gauge emotional response—happy, sad, etc.</p>
