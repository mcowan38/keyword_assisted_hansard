<p data-HoCid="8714728" data-originallang="en"> Chair, maybe to start with the end of the member's question, the issue of the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people is a matter that government has had on the record for a period of time. There's no issue about that with respect to the Palestinian people. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8714727" data-originallang="en">The question of the timing of the government's decision, again, is a political question. As the legal adviser of the department, I wouldn't be able to speak to those political considerations, but the criteria normally taken into account by a state to make such a decision are available for the government. I would not want to suggest that the way the government made its decision on previous recognitions of state binds the government on future ones. </p>
