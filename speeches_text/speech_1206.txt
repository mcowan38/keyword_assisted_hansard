<p data-HoCid="6833904" data-originallang="en">I'd like to begin by thanking all of our witnesses for being here today to help us figure out what the situation is on the ground and to try to protect communities across Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6833905" data-originallang="en">I represent a riding that has a very high percentage of Muslims as well as Jewish Canadians. I've heard from both sides how much the fear is very real right now. I've heard that the Jewish community does feel that anti-Semitism is on the rise, especially in the last couple of months. After seeing what happened in London last week, obviously the Muslim community feels afraid to walk in the streets, afraid to go to the mosque, afraid to do things that they shouldn't be afraid of doing. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6833906" data-originallang="en">Currently we have a program—and I'm sure you guys are aware of the it—called the security infrastructure program. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6833907" data-originallang="en"> I know that, Mr. Fogel, you mentioned that rebates should be given to institutions to help with security. I'm hearing that perhaps what's already available isn't enough, and maybe there are better ways of doing it. Do you mind commenting on that? This question is for both of you.</p>
