<p data-HoCid="7164250" data-originallang="en">We need not underestimate what tobacco means in terms of the global health crisis as well. Robert Proctor has discussed this in his book the <em>Golden Holocaust</em>, for example, which looks at the history of this. A move like the one by WHO to be proactive on this was very important. Basically the agreement was that they would not be doing business with arms companies and tobacco companies. That is the policy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7164251" data-originallang="en">Now we can disagree with that policy in times of sanitary emergency, but at the same time WHO would have been criticized even more if it had refused to enforce its policy at that time. This is very sad and we can blame Canada for basically funding this. At the same time, we need to understand that it is not the role of Philip Morris to be doing this type of research. It could have been very easyâ€”</p>
