<p data-HoCid="8692080" data-originallang="en">Let's be clear here, on the other side what I'm hearing is we want to deal with the anti-Semitism study and get it behind us, and we want to deal with Bill <a data-HoCid="11714011" href="/bills/44-1/C-270/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (pornographic material)">C-270</a>. We could have been finished the anti-Semitism report about half an hour ago if they had just voted yes to the motion, which is to do the second part of what they say they want to do. I don't know whether it's hypocritical or ironic or both. It's absurd, what I'm hearing from the other side. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8692081" data-originallang="en">What I heard from Mr. Brock was that the person who introduced this private member's bill gave him a list of witnesses, which I now have to assume means his own name isn't on it. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8692082" data-originallang="en">As for the contents of my tweet, I did not raise this issue. <a data-HoCid="278476" href="/politicians/arnold-viersen/" title="Arnold Viersen">Mr. Viersen</a> did. This is not a break-the-glass scenario, Mr. Brock. The issue is in the public and being discussed because Mr. Viersen raised it. Full stop. </p>

<p data-HoCid="8692084" data-originallang="en">For the record, I'm prepared to come back here after question period and listen to you talk all afternoon if your intention is to just delay and delay, because my goal is to get back to that study, get it completed as quickly as possible and get this bill before this committee so we can do our job. </p>
