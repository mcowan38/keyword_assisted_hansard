<p data-HoCid="8703028" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703029" data-originallang="fr">I'll come back to you, Mr. Topas, because I didn't have time to finish asking my question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703030" data-originallang="fr">Unlike Mr. Fogel, you're not proposing that we give even more attention to the Palestinian Authority; you're proposing that we cut ties with the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703031" data-originallang="fr">Did I understand you correctly?</p>
