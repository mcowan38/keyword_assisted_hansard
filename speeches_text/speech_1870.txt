<p data-HoCid="7345599" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345600" data-originallang="en">I want to say from the outset that I share the minister's strong disappointment with the CRTC's comments that were reported today. This organization, CMAC, and Mr. Marouf should not be funded by anyone or any agency at all, so I appreciate the minister's comments with respect to that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345601" data-originallang="en">As someone who has been involved since 2015 on this anti-Semitism issue, whether with respect to the apology about the <em>St. Louis</em>, with respect to the nomination of Irwin Cotler as our special envoy on anti-Semitism, with respect to the decision to adopt the IHRA definition and implement it across government, or with respect to the decision to criminalize Holocaust denial and supporting that—which was originally a motion from our colleague Mr. Waugh that became part of the budget implementation bill—I think we've had a very strong record as a government and across party lines in fighting anti-Semitism in this country. That is why this situation was so disappointing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345602" data-originallang="en">Minister, I appreciate your efforts to take responsibility and say that you're going to get this problem fixed now on the due diligence side, on the contractual side and on the training side, because those are all really important. I want to ask a couple of questions about that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345603" data-originallang="en"> First, though, there are many members of Canada's Jewish community who feel, for whatever reason, that anti-Semitism is not treated on par with other forms of racism. Can you reassure Canadians, particularly the Jewish community, that you believe anti-Semitism is just as important as any other form of racism or phobia in this country?</p>
