<p data-HoCid="8583895" data-originallang="en"> Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to an Ethiopian couple who tragically lost their lives in an arson attack at the House of Covenant International Church in Winnipeg last month. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8583896" data-originallang="en">Geda and Zenabu recently came to Canada with hope but instead were met with horror. They were living above their church, which provides affordable housing for newcomers. In the middle of the night, a heinous act of arson consumed the church, and the couple trapped above were killed. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8583897" data-originallang="en">This is not an isolated incident. The government recently revealed that nearly 600 places of worship have been burned. Canada needs to protect places of worship from arson. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8583898" data-originallang="en">I have introduced Bill <a data-HoCid="13180878" href="/bills/44-1/C-411/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (arson â€” wildfires and places of worship)">C-411</a>, the anti-arson act, to address attacks against our churches, mosques, gurdwaras, synagogues and mandirs.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8583899" data-originallang="en">I extend my sincerest condolences to the family of the victims and members of the Ethiopian Society of Winnipeg, who continue to grieve at this time.</p>
