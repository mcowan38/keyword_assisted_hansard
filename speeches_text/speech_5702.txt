<p data-HoCid="8783022" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Madam Chair, and members of the committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8783023" data-originallang="en"> I'll be presenting today key items from the 2024-25 supplementary estimates (B) for the Department of Justice. This funding will make a real difference for people in this country who interact with our justice system, including victims. These items fit into our government's broader plan to increase affordability, provide social supports and create a better Canada. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8783024" data-originallang="en">Access to justice is a top priority of mine. To this end, I've put considerable time and effort into filling judicial vacancies. I've appointed 178 judges since I became minister. During my first year alone, I appointed 137 judges. The previous annual record was 107. Right now more than 96% of the judicial positions across the country are filled. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8783025" data-originallang="en">A robust legal aid system is another key pillar of access to justice. I believe legal aid provides fair representation. It ensures the smooth functioning of the court process and ensures that cases are heard in a timely manner. This year's supplementary estimates (B) provide $80 million for criminal legal aid for provinces and territories and $71.6 million for immigration and refugee legal aid services. This funding will pave the way for greater access to justice for indigenous persons, for individuals from Black and other racialized communities and for those with mental health issues, all of whom are overrepresented in the criminal justice system. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8783026" data-originallang="en">If these supplementary estimates do not pass in Parliament, this critical support will be jeopardized. That needs to be understood by all committee members. Justice will not be served and people will suffer, particularly victims of crime. I know there are colleagues at this table who care about these issues, but I also know that some people may be instructed to oppose these measures. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8783027" data-originallang="en">To my Bloc and NDP colleagues, I think we know how some members will vote on these measures, including the official opposition. I'm looking to you to ensure that the estimates are able to come to a vote and pass.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8783028" data-originallang="fr">I would like to point out other areas in which the supplementary estimates provide essential support for Canadians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8783029" data-originallang="fr">This will support the provision of legal advice and information to individuals who have been sexually harassed in their workplace. Sexual harassment is a scourge that disproportionately affects women. Statistics Canada tells us that one woman in four and one man in six have reported being victims of sexualized and inappropriate conduct in the workplace.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8783030" data-originallang="fr">We also know that a large majority of incidents are not reported, which means that the real figures are probably higher. The $10.3 million in funding provided in these estimates would help to support people going through a traumatic time, in particular if they do not have the resources to pay for legal representation or if they are unaware of their rights.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8783031" data-originallang="en">The legal aid program would support access to free legal information and advice to anyone who believes they have been sexually harassed in the workplace. This is very important funding.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8783032" data-originallang="en"> The official opposition asserts that they care about addressing gender-based violence. They are often very performative about it, but I expect that, yet again, they will follow their <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">leader</a>'s instructions and vote against supporting victims of gender-based violence.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8783033" data-originallang="en">This funding dovetails with a concerted effort from our government to support women and curb sexual assault and gender-based violence. Gender-based violence is an epidemic in this country and it must stop.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8783034" data-originallang="en"> This is why we passed laws requiring training for judges on sexual assault and intimate partner violence. I worked on it at this very committee. That was Bill <a data-HoCid="10867694" href="/bills/43-2/C-3/" title="An Act to amend the Judges Act and the Criminal Code">C-3</a>, which we called the Rona Ambrose law, from the 43rd Parliament.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8783035" data-originallang="en"> We also strengthened the national sex offender registry with Bill <a data-HoCid="12367527" href="/bills/44-1/S-12/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code, the Sex Offender Information Registration Act and the International Transfer of Offenders Act">S-12</a> in this Parliament and reformed publication ban laws to empower victims to tell their own stories. We toughened bail laws for intimate partner violence offenders in Bill <a data-HoCid="9745407" href="/bills/42-1/C-75/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code, the Youth Criminal Justice Act and other Acts and to make consequential amendments to other Acts">C-75</a> and Bill <a data-HoCid="12426046" href="/bills/44-1/C-48/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (bail reform)">C-48</a>. We funded women's shelters and crisis hotlines so that victims are supported in their time of need. We will continue to do everything we can to end sexual harassment and gender-based violence in Canada. I'm proud that this funding will contribute to this very important goal.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8783036" data-originallang="en">The <a data-HoCid="12913297" href="/bills/44-1/C-63/" title="An Act to enact the Online Harms Act, to amend the Criminal Code, the Canadian Human Rights Act and An Act respecting the mandatory reporting of Internet child pornography by persons who provide an Internet service and to make consequential and related amendments to other Acts">online harms act</a> will concretely tackle online sexual violence. For the first time, we are mandating that online platforms do their part to keep people in Canada, especially children, safe online. We are ensuring that child sexual exploitation material and non-consensual intimate images, including deepfakes, are subject to a takedown order. Online platforms will no longer get a free pass for hosting vile content. Women and girls across Canada are being intimidated and harassed online. We've seen children pass by suicide because of online abuse.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8783037" data-originallang="en">Enough is clearly enough. In our increasingly online world, we do not have time to spare. We need to act intentionally. We need to pass Bill <a data-HoCid="12913297" href="/bills/44-1/C-63/" title="An Act to enact the Online Harms Act, to amend the Criminal Code, the Canadian Human Rights Act and An Act respecting the mandatory reporting of Internet child pornography by persons who provide an Internet service and to make consequential and related amendments to other Acts">C-63</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8783038" data-originallang="fr">I would now like to address another subject that is important to Canadians: protecting tenants. We know that housing is one of the main sources of stress for Canadians right now, and this is particularly true for tenants.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8783039" data-originallang="fr">Rising rents, renovictions and the lack of opportunities when it comes to housing availability are pushing tenants to leave their communities. Tenants also face unique challenges when it comes to making sure that their housing is properly maintained and their landlord obeys provincial laws.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8783040" data-originallang="fr">Tenants' rights and legal services organizations can help tenants work things out and overcome complex problems. Tenants facing threats to the security of their housing can feel especially powerless and alone.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8783041" data-originallang="en">This is why in budget 2024 our government proposed an investment of $50 million over five years to establish what we call a new tenant protection fund. Our government has made substantial advancements in housing. We know everyone deserves an affordable place to call home. Our housing accelerator fund is making a real difference in communities across Canada. It is very unfortunate that Conservative members of Parliament have been barred by their <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">leader</a> from accessing these funds for their communities. That's unfair, and it's certainly not leadership. The tenant protection fund is just one of many elements of these supplementary estimates that will go towards building more housing. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8783042" data-originallang="en">Other items include $135 million for the Canada housing benefit to provide low- and moderate-income renters the ability to make ends meet. We're putting $99 million into the rapid acquisition of shelter space and deeply affordable housing. We're devoting $27 million to co-op housing developmentâ€”a great way to increase affordable options for families. We will continue showing up for Canadians by rapidly building the housing we need. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8783043" data-originallang="en">I'd like to speak about one last item, which is new funding of $4.9 million through the estimates for victims and survivors of hate crimes. This funding is part of Canada's action plan on combatting hate. The action plan represents Canada's first-ever comprehensive, cross-government effort to combat hate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8783044" data-originallang="en">Budget 2024 announced $29 million over six years, starting this year, to enhance or establish financial assistance and compensation programs for victims of hate-motivated crime. The funding would also help raise awareness in the judiciary about the unique dynamics of hate crime, and support the development and delivery of specialized training for Crown prosecutors on this very topic. We've seen an alarming rise in hate crimes in Canada. Horrible incidents of anti-Semitism have skyrocketed. Hate against the queer community is up. People don't feel safe in their own neighbourhoods. It is unacceptable and un-Canadian. We need to stamp out hatred in our communities and ensure perpetrators are held to account. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8783045" data-originallang="en">Bill <a data-HoCid="12913297" href="/bills/44-1/C-63/" title="An Act to enact the Online Harms Act, to amend the Criminal Code, the Canadian Human Rights Act and An Act respecting the mandatory reporting of Internet child pornography by persons who provide an Internet service and to make consequential and related amendments to other Acts">C-63</a> is a key part of our plan to stop hatred in Canada. I was very proud to stand alongside the National Council of Canadian Muslims, the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, the Canadian Race Relations Foundation and others when I introduced Bill C-63 in February of this year. I share the disappointment of many Canadians that this bill has been stalled in the House of Commons by partisan games. Bill C-63 creates tougher penalties for hate crimes and ensures there are mechanisms to hold people accountable for online hate that would not be acceptable in the off-line world. I am proud of this legislation, and I hope to see it progress soon. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8783046" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair and committee members, the appropriations requested through the supplementary estimates (B) are part of our government's larger vision of support, rather than cuts, for Canadians. I am committed to creating a justice system that is accessible, fair and efficient. I work every day towards achieving this goal. I hope all members of this committee will work to ensure this important funding flows to Canadians. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8783047" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much. </p>
