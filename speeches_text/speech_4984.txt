<p data-HoCid="8594933" data-originallang="en">The government has sought to divide Canadians by saying one thing to one group and precisely the opposite to another group, and here in this House, it remains radio-silent on condemning anti-Semitic chants and on supporting Israel's right to truly defend itself by retaliating against terrorists and tyrants. Why will the minister not do the right thing and stand beside the Jewish people today?</p>
