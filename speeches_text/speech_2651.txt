<p data-HoCid="7957722" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for his speech. I enjoy working with him from time to time on committees.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957723" data-originallang="fr">I just asked a question a moment ago, but they were unable to come up with an answer. Right now, Gaza is blockaded, and under international law, humanitarian corridors should be set up. Not only should they be set up under international law, but they must be.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957724" data-originallang="fr">The Conservatives are of the same opinion as the Bloc Québécois, and they are calling for the same things as the Bloc Québécois, the NDP and even the government of the day. Everyone is calling for a humanitarian corridor, but unfortunately there is none right now. A lot of pressure is starting to build on the Gaza Strip and, of course, on its people. This is endangering the well-being of the entire region. We can see that certain countries are looking to get involved, given the lack of a humanitarian corridor.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957725" data-originallang="fr">In my colleague's opinion, what is preventing Israel from setting up a humanitarian corridor?</p>
