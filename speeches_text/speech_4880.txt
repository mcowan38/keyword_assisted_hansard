<p data-HoCid="8576465" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the International Court of Justice did not find that Israel had committed genocide; it just asked the State of Israel to comply with the 1948 Genocide Convention, which Israel is in the process of and has been doing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576466" data-originallang="en">With respect to Amnesty International's interpretation of international humanitarian law, I disagree with its interpretation of the facts on the ground. At the end of the day, there have been no credible reports that I have read that indicate the State of Israel has committed war crimes or has had grave breaches of customary international law. What I do know is that the terrorist group Hamas, in taking some 250 hostages last October 7, did commit war crimes; that is obviously a war crime. Also, Hamas, in executing and targeting some 1,100 innocent civilians, committed war crimes. Those are findings I think the international community has agreed to that adhere to Hamas, for which it should be held responsible. </p>
