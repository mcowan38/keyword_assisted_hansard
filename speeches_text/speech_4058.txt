Sometimes groups outside of the coalition ask for matching funds. I hope that you, in the future, will consider those requests. I'm sure you do already, but it's just on that particular point.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8396417" data-originallang="en">Minister, you started to touch upon a point that I wanted to elaborate on. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8396418" data-originallang="en">You have spoken to this already in part, around UNRWA, and around the nightmare that we are seeing occur within Gaza with the humanitarian crisis that is occurring there. Our allies, including America, have highlighted and pinpointed that much more unimpeded humanitarian aid needs to get into Gaza. Our allies, including America, have stated as such. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8396419" data-originallang="en">First, can you tell us why UNRWA is so important for the delivery of that aid? </p>
<p data-HoCid="8396420" data-originallang="en">Second, can you tell us anything in addition to this that you would like to share in terms of Canada's record with respect to stepping in during this crisis, this nightmare?</p>
