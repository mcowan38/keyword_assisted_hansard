<p data-HoCid="8756244" data-originallang="fr">The Liberals have said they are, and I quote, determined to find solutions that meet the needs of all Canadians.

Bill <a data-HoCid="12830843" href="/bills/44-1/C-373/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (promotion of hatred or antisemitism)">C‑373</a> does exactly that, and it is supported by 66% of Canadians and 75% of Quebeckers.</p>
