<p data-HoCid="7988225" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much for appearing this morning on the very heartbreaking situation that's taking place in the Middle East. Thanks for the information that you've provided.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988226" data-originallang="en">First, Ms. Sunday, you mentioned that 8,448 inquiries have been received so far. Do you have a breakdown on these inquiries? Do they come from Gaza, from Ramallah, from Lebanon, from Jordan, or, of course, from inside Israel? If that information is available, we would be happy to receive it.</p>
