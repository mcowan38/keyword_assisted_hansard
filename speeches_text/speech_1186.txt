<p data-HoCid="6829796" data-originallang="en">Do you see this picture? I hope everyone sees it. This girl, 13 years old, was arrested. They said—they made this up—that if the girl was a virgin when they executed her, she would go to heaven. They don't want these people to go to heaven, because they stand up in front of them and are against them, so they raped this girl in order for her not to go to heaven. They want to play God. For me as a Muslim, it's not people who judge me. It's God who judges my actions. For them, because they want to teach other people who is the boss, they are even doing this—being judges who execute their own kids.</p>

If you're Christian, you're Muslim, you're Jewish or whatever, if you come out of the house, you have to have it. At the beginning, they were throwing acid in the faces of people. It happened in Isfahan. If you look on the Internet, you can see that there have been seven or eight cases. Today the imam says it at Friday prayers, and the next day seven people have acid thrown in their face. </p>
