<p data-HoCid="8454050" data-originallang="en">Let me ask the question in a different way. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8454051" data-originallang="en">You aren't allocating the proper resources, because you're misallocating them. Mr. Zain Haq is in Canada on a student visa. The rules for maintaining status with a student visa require abiding by Canadian lawâ€”clear and transparent rules that aren't available for Gazans and Sudanese. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8454052" data-originallang="en">Mr. Haq broke Canadian law 10 times, plus a contempt of court order. Do you think this case warrants your intervention more than intervening for Gazans or Sudanese refugees?</p>
