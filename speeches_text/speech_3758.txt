I'm delighted to know that, at the very least, her family members are safe, even if they are in Egypt. Assuming they meet the program criteria, they can expect to be able to come to Canada as family members. This is the first time you've mentioned this to me in person. I'd be delighted to work with my team and follow up.</p>

However, I want you to know that we will be working on this with my team, Mr. Brunelleâ€‘Duceppe.</p>
