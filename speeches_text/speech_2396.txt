<p data-HoCid="7852271" data-originallang="en">We have to recognize that at the core of all these different religious traditions, particularly the Abrahamic faiths, there's an understanding of the inherency of human dignity. While a particular religious tradition might have a different view of anthropology or of sexuality, at the core—certainly of the Christian tradition, the Jewish tradition and the Islamic tradition—is an understanding of the dignity of the human person.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7852272" data-originallang="en">While there might be differences of views on sexuality, anthropology and what have you, we're still called to recognize, in the person with whom we might disagree, their inherent dignity. Certainly, chaplains have to be able to minister to them, recognizing that dignity.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7852273" data-originallang="en">To say that if you hold a particular view that's not in sync with a particular secular view you're not qualified to be a chaplain is very narrow-minded and doesn't demonstrate the sort of robust pluralism and diversity that we should be really advancing within our society and certainly within the CAF. Given the realities of Canadian Armed Forces personnel and what they deal with, they need to be able to have access to authentic, integrated pastoral care.</p>
