<p data-HoCid="6791787" data-originallang="en">On that note, since 2014, Hamas has been holding the bodies of Israeli soldiers Hadar Goldin and Oron Shaul. Since 2014, Hamas has also been holding Avera Mengistu, an Israeli civilian, prisoner, as well as an Israeli Bedouin civilian, Hisham al-Sayed, since 2015. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6791788" data-originallang="en">Are there any indications, especially now with the ceasefire discussions that are going on, that, after nearly seven years, Hamas is willing to return the remains of Goldin and Shaul to their families for burial or release the additional hostages?</p>
