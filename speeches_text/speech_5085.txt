<p data-HoCid="8667140" data-originallang="en">I'm going to reference a New York Times article by Sheera Frenkel. It states that Israel secretly targeted U.S. lawmakers with an influence campaign on the Gaza war. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8667141" data-originallang="en">This was actually a campaign that Meta did uncover, so I want to give you the opportunity to talk a little bit about this. It began in October. It remains active on X. At its peak, it used hundreds of fake accounts on Facebook and Instagram to post pro-Israel statements. The accounts focused on U.S. lawmakers, particularly those who were Black and Democrat—and I take a specific interest in that—such as representatives like Hakeem Jeffries. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8667142" data-originallang="en">Then a further report out of NBC News said that Meta and OpenAI said that they had disrupted influence operations linked to an Israeli company. Your tech company announced that Project Stoic, which was a political marketing and business intelligence firm based in Tel Aviv, used their products nefariously to manipulate various political conversations online. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8667143" data-originallang="en">As a Canadian lawmaker, then, what assurance do I have that these same tactics, these nefarious tactics linked to this Israeli firm, weren't used to target parliamentarians such as myself? </p>
