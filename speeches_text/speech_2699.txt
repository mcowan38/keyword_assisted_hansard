<p data-HoCid="7956768" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak about the conflict in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank. Over a week ago, Canadians awoke to horrifying images coming out of Israel after the terrorist organization Hamas launched an attack of unspeakable brutality.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7956769" data-originallang="fr">I would like to update the House on the measures our government is taking to help and protect affected Canadians. I would then like to talk about the real concerns that this situation is causing here at home for Jewish and Muslim Canadians, for Arab Canadians and for all Canadians. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7956770" data-originallang="fr">Among the thousands of people affected by this violence, five Canadians have been murdered by Hamas terrorists and three Canadians are missing and possibly being held hostage. I know that the thoughts of all parliamentarians and all Canadians are with them and their loved ones. Canada is calling on Hamas to release all the hostages immediately.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7956771" data-originallang="en">Ten Canadian Armed Forces flights have departed Tel Aviv so far, with approximately 1,300 passengers on board. In addition, the first bus has departed the West Bank and brought Canadians to safety in Jordan.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7956772" data-originallang="fr">The <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> and our embassies in the region are working tirelessly to help them. They are working hard to contact affected Canadians and help them. We are working closely with our allies and our partners to help people get out of Gaza, the West Bank and Israel as safely and as soon as possible.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7956773" data-originallang="en">We are also deeply concerned by the dire and worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Canada is calling for unimpeded humanitarian access and a humanitarian corridor so that essential aid, including food, fuel and water, can be delivered to civilians in Gaza. It is imperative that this happen.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7956774" data-originallang="fr">Since last weekend, I have spoken with leaders from across the region, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, King Abdullah II of Jordan, the President of the United Arab Emirates and, today, Egyptian President Al-Sis and the Emir of Qatar. I spoke with them about the release of Canadian hostages and all other hostages, the delivery of humanitarian aid, the assistance needed to ensure the safety of Canadians, and peace and stability in the region.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7956775" data-originallang="fr">The <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> was on site this weekend. She is leading our diplomatic efforts by working day and night. She is also meeting with with Israelis, Palestinians and other partners in the region.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7956776" data-originallang="en"> <a data-HoCid="300003" href="/politicians/bill-blair/" title="Bill Blair">Minister Blair</a> is working tirelessly to ensure CAF evacuation flights are getting as many Canadians out of the region as possible, and <a data-HoCid="300012" href="/politicians/ahmed-hussen/" title="Ahmed Hussen">Minister Hussen</a> is leading conversations with his international counterparts—</p>
