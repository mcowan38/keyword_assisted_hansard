<p data-HoCid="8726905" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, d'Adil Charkaoui is exhorting crowds to pray for Israel to be wiped off the map at protests where people are setting cars on fire and breaking shop windows. Protests in Montreal are becoming more and more violent, and the target of this violence is increasingly clear: Quebec's Jewish community. It is beyond intolerable that a human rights defender like Irwin Cotler has been threatened and placed under police protection in Quebec, that synagogues are being fired upon and that people are being intimidated, assaulted and threatened because they are Jewish.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726906" data-originallang="fr">People are entitled to demonstrate, people are entitled to support Gaza in the conflict with Israel. We cannot remain insensitive to the fate of the people of Gaza. We have seen the suffering of women and children in the Gaza Strip and we too want this war to come to an end, but nothing justifies this emerging antisemitism. These antisemitic acts are a stain on pro-Palestinians and on Quebec. It is high time they ended. </p>
