<p data-HoCid="7285571" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7285572" data-originallang="fr">I have not received any amendments. Ms. Khalid and I had a discussion on Friday, but I have not received any amendments officially.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7285573" data-originallang="fr">Nonetheless, the motion arises out of a series of articles in the press and questions that were asked, and responded to, in the House of Commons that raised doubts concerning unauthorized surveillance by the RCMP of members of the public and parliamentarians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7285574" data-originallang="fr">Committee members and regular participants know that I am not someone who engages in witch hunts. However, I believe that privacy is a fundamental matter, and in fact, it's something that the government strongly supports. This motion is not partisan; it is in the public interest.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7285575" data-originallang="fr">Given this kind of doubt regarding such an important subject, I think it is worthwhile to get to the bottom of things and put the question directly to the people involved. Was the Pegasus software used or not, and if so, how and for what purposes?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7285576" data-originallang="fr">For context, I should point out that Pegasus is Israeli software used by a number of countries for conducting surveillance. The software has a dubious reputation in several respects.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7285577" data-originallang="fr">When the journalist asked the RCMP whether it used Pegasus, the force replied that it used a program that had device investigation tools. The expression “device investigation tools” was not a direct answer to the question. That was not the question asked. I therefore want an opportunity to put the question directly: Is that the case, and if so, what is the situation?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7285578" data-originallang="fr">However, we have to be clear on why we are doing this study. The purpose of this motion is to make sure that the RCMP is complying with best practices in this area and, if that is not the case, to provide the force with best practices, by way of policies, so that we can continue to trust our national police force.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7285579" data-originallang="fr">So that's the background to the motion.</p>
