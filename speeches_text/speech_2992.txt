<p data-HoCid="8015957" data-originallang="en">That's fair enough. Absolutely.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8015958" data-originallang="en"> I will add that we had agreed in a preliminary way to set a deadline of today for witnesses for the Israel-Gaza study. We had not specified whether that's by end of day or earlier. Now that we have more time, and until further notice, should you think of more witnesses, please don't hesitate to add them to your individual list. At some point, we'll agree on a deadline for the submission of witnesses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8015959" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8015960" data-originallang="en">This meeting is adjourned.</p>
