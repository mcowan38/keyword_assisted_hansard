<p data-HoCid="8406096" data-originallang="en"> Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8406097" data-originallang="en">First of all, thank you for coming. I think there are going to be a lot of people who look up to you from now on, and I hope that you give them the voice and the courage that you've had today to come here.</p>

There are some people who speak out of both sides of their mouth that sit in the powers of government and there are some people who do not have a seat at the table who say all of the right things in the right venuesâ€”and do not be fooled by them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8406099" data-originallang="en">Now, I want to know, with just a quick yes or no, do you feel safe on campus, Rachel?</p>
