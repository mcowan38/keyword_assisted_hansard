<p data-HoCid="8454086" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Minister.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8454087" data-originallang="en">Along with our colleague Salma Zahid, we had an opportunity to visit Palestine. We heard the stories on the ground of what the people are going through. It's from both sides. Human lives are being lost. It's a human tragedy. Here at home, Islamophobia, as you rightly said, and anti-Semitism are on the rise. Our Conservative friends are exploiting the situation rather than bringing people together. I agree with you that we should not be using this as a political issue. This is a human tragedy. We should, first of all, all come together to call for a ceasefire and try to make every effort to save lives in Gaza, Rafah and Sudan.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8454088" data-originallang="en">I want to change the topic towards the processing centre under the Indo-Pacific strategy. We announced in 2022 that funds were allocated. Three other locations are up and running, but Islamabad is still in.... We don't have updates.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8454089" data-originallang="en">If you could submit that in writing to the committee, that would be appreciated.</p>
