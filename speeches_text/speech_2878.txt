<p data-HoCid="7968692" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I have heard from many constituents about their concerns regarding the recent events in the Middle East. Canada is a nation of peace and must do everything it can to find a way to end the bombardment of Gaza and the current conflict and continue to ensure that humanitarian aid reaches those devastated by the violence. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7968693" data-originallang="en">Innocent Palestinians living in Gaza have the right to the essentials of life and the right to live in dignity. We support Israel in its drive to free hostages held by Hamas and to protect itself from further terrorist attacks within the limits of international and humanitarian law. At home, we must not entrench ourselves in positions pitted against one another. Reports of hate crimes, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia hurt us all. This is not the way to find peace and promote security, not in Israel and Palestine and certainly not here in Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7968694" data-originallang="en">Peace be with us all. <em>Shalom</em>. <em>Salaam</em>.</p>
