<p data-HoCid="6040963" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for <a data-HoCid="253108" href="/politicians/michael-levitt/" title="Michael Levitt">York Centre</a> for his advocacy on this very important issue. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6040964" data-originallang="en">Canada is, and will always be, a steadfast ally of Israel. Canada remains very concerned about any effort to single out or isolate Israel internationally. Let me be firm and clear to all Canadians: We condemn BDS. As a country, we need to urgently address the resurgence of anti-Semitism at home and abroad. We will continue to stand with the Jewish community in Canada and around the world.</p>
