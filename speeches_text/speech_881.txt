<p data-HoCid="6662632" data-originallang="en"> Good evening. It's my honour to testify before you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6662633" data-originallang="en">I am Clemente Bautista. I am the international network coordinator for the Kalikasan People's Network for the Environment. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6662634" data-originallang="en">Kalikasan is a leading network in the Philippines working on ecological protection, conservation of resources and defending the rights of people and communities. We have previously received funding from the Canadian government through its Canada fund for local initiatives.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6662635" data-originallang="en">I have been involved in advocacy regarding environmental degradation, human rights violations and environmental justice related to the operation of foreign mining corporations, such as Canadian-owned OceanaGold, TVI Pacific, Placer Dome and B2Gold.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6662636" data-originallang="en">In 2004, indigenous Subanon leaders testified before this committee about the harm they were enduring from TVI Pacific. In its 2005 report, this committee recommended that Canada should develop laws to hold Canadian companies to account for the harm they do overseas. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6662637" data-originallang="en">According to the international organization Global Witness, the Philippines was the most dangerous place for environmental defenders in 2018.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6662638" data-originallang="en">In Kalikasan's 2019 submission to the UN Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights, OHCHR, we reported that from 2001 to 2018, at least 225 environmental defenders were killed. The majority of the victims came from rural sectors; 36% were indigenous peoples and 58% were involved in campaigns against large-scale mining projects.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6662639" data-originallang="en">There are other forms of human rights violations, such as red-tagging, which is the practice of state forces classifying individuals as members of rebel groups, such as the New People's Army, NPA, and the Communist Party of the Philippines, CPP, leading to trumped-up charges, warrantless arrests, illegal detention and extrajudicial killings.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6662640" data-originallang="en">Kalikasan and its staff have been red-tagged as a front for the NPA and CPP. During meetings at the Canadian embassy in Manila, we and our partner organizations who are opposing OceanaGold and whose lives were in danger were asked if our local organizations are a front for the rebel groups. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6662641" data-originallang="en">In 2019, police officials threatened to raid our office alleging we were recruiting rebels, because we sheltered indigenous people displaced by mining projects and the militarization in their communities. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6662642" data-originallang="en">How dangerous is this? </p>
<p data-HoCid="6662643" data-originallang="en">In April 2018, human rights and environmental defender Benjamin Ramos was accused of being a CPP member. Months later he was assassinated.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6662644" data-originallang="en">News articles, UN Human Rights Council reports, statements of UN officials and findings by the Philippines Human Rights Commission validate my testimony. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6662645" data-originallang="en">On the human rights and environmental violations of OceanaGold Corporation in the Philippines, our field investigations showed worsening degradation in the mining-affected area, such as water pollution, forest denudation, along with social impacts such as community displacement, land grabbing, militarization and increasing community disputes. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6662646" data-originallang="en">In December 2009, the Philippines Human Rights Commission reported that OceanaGold committed human rights violations in Nueva Vizcaya, particularly the displacement of indigenous peoples. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6662647" data-originallang="en">In February 2017, the Philippines Department of Environment and Natural Resources ordered the suspension of OceanaGold for serious environmental violations. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6662648" data-originallang="en">In December 2018, we submitted to the UN a complaint against OceanaGold. Our concerns were formally relayed by seven UN special rapporteurs to the Philippine government and the company. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6662649" data-originallang="en">Since July 2019, OceanaGold has not had a permit to operate. There has been an ongoing people's barricade since then to oppose the mine reopening. The people are supported by different sectors. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6662650" data-originallang="en">In December 2020, in a letter to President Rodrigo Duterte, Nueva Vizcaya Governor Carlos Padilla, along with the other religious groups, reiterated their opposition to the reopening of the mine. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6662651" data-originallang="en">The call to stop the operation of OceanaGold rings clear and loudly in the Philippines. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6662652" data-originallang="en">On the ombudsperson, it is my understanding that civil society in Canada agrees that the ombudsperson should have investigatory powers to get to the bottom of the facts by being able to compel the company to provide critical documents and testimony.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6662653" data-originallang="en"> I hope that this will be immediately realized.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6662654" data-originallang="en"> <em>Maraming Salamat po</em>. </p>
