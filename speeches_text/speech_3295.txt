<p data-HoCid="8126564" data-originallang="en"> I didn't want to do this as a point of order, but I wanted to point out, in regard to Ms. Gazan's point about what I had said, that I was actually saying that the City of Peterborough has declared intimate partner violence an epidemic. That's what I was saying.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8126565" data-originallang="en">To Mr. Serré's point, why wouldn't we add “intimate partner and persons”, then? That would just be a friendly conversation I would have with you if you wanted me to put it forward as an amendment, because I hear what you're saying and I think I understand it, but why would you remove that word?</p>
