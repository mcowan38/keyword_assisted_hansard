<p data-HoCid="8107763" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8107764" data-originallang="en">I tend to be somebody like Mr. Garrison, I think, who is collegial and tries to be pragmatic. I think most of us in this committee, fortunately, are that way, so I just want to start by saying, because somebody made a comment about Jews, that Randall Garrison has been the most solid ally I have ever had in the NDP in standing up for the Jewish community in Canada. I want to put that on the record.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8107765" data-originallang="en">Second, on this issue, my understanding in committees that I've always been on is that clause-by-clause on bills supersedes other meetings. When you move to clause-by-clause on a bill, you continue clause-by-clause on a bill until you finish clause-by-clause on that bill. I personally thought that there was clearly an understanding here at the end of the last meeting that we would then continue with clause-by-clause on Thursday. I thought that was fully understood. Certainly, it was my full understanding.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8107766" data-originallang="en">The <a data-HoCid="299996" href="/politicians/arif-virani/" title="Arif Virani">minister</a>, I think.... I will answer Mr. Brock's question. The deadline for the committee's voting on the estimates passed before today. It doesn't mean that you can't ask every question you want of the minister. We often entertain ministers after the deadline for that ends. It would be no different if you had him today or next Tuesday on that question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8107767" data-originallang="en">My recommendation—since, I think, none of us wants to be here tomorrow—is that we move through the clause-by-clause on this bill, which is supposed to be on our agenda, before we finish today. There are only five amendments proposed. The Conservatives, with all the flaws in the bill that Mr. Moore mentioned, proposed only one amendment. Let's try to get through that. I think we can, if we really try. Then we will have the <a data-HoCid="299996" href="/politicians/arif-virani/" title="Arif Virani">minister</a> at the next meeting, on Tuesday, and we won't have to worry about Friday meetings that may or may not be in order.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8107768" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
