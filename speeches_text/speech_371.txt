<p data-HoCid="6277370" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I rise in the House today to join the Jewish community in my riding, across Canada and around the world in celebrating Sukkot.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6277371" data-originallang="en">Last Friday night, Canadian Jews marked the beginning of this joyous, eight-day festival. The festival commemorates the 40-year period during which the ancient Israelites wandered in the Sinai desert while living in temporary dwellings. Traditionally, during the festival, many families build temporary outdoor shelters, sukkahs, to inhabit during this important feast. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6277372" data-originallang="en">Sadly, the reality of anti-Semitism continues to threaten the peace and freedom of Jewish people. The Jewish community in Canada remains the most targeted group for hate crimes. We know from history that scapegoating and slanderous narratives against Jews incited a Holocaust that led to the murder of nearly six million Jews. Today and always, I express my solidarity with the Jewish people in standing against all acts of anti-Semitism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6277373" data-originallang="en"> On behalf of my Conservative caucus, I wish all Jewish Canadians celebrating Sukkot a <em>Chag Sameach</em>.</p>
