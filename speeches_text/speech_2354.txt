<p data-HoCid="7735874" data-originallang="en">Before we begin discussion, I'd remind committee members that if NDP-5 as moved by Ms. Gazan is adopted, BQ-3 cannot be moved, due to a line conflict.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7735875" data-originallang="en">We will proceed with discussion on the amendment moved by Ms. Gazan.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7735876" data-originallang="en">Ms. Saks, do you want the floor?</p>
