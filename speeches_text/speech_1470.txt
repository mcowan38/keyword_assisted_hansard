<p data-HoCid="6998853" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member across the way for his very logical approach to the discussion we are having today. On Monday, we had a midnight debate on supporting Ukraine. What I am hearing in the discussion is that now we are rehashing some of the things we have already agreed with. What we are putting on the table is something we have not discussed, and it would be a longer-term project.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6998854" data-originallang="en">Could the hon. member comment on the use of the House in supporting Ukraine, versus going down rabbit holes?</p>
