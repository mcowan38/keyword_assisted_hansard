<p data-HoCid="8448686" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, despite promising to do so three months ago, the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="MÃ©lanie Joly">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> has failed to issue a notice to exporters telling them that they cannot sell weapons to Netanyahu's government. As Palestinians are starving, as violence in the West Bank escalates and as UN experts are calling for the recognition of Palestine, the Liberals will not act to stop a genocide. Peace requires action. Justice requires action: two-way arms embargo, sanctions on Netanyahu's war cabinet and recognition of Palestine.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8448687" data-originallang="en">When will the minister stop speaking empty words and take action?</p>
