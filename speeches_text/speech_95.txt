<p data-HoCid="6022851" data-originallang="en"> <span class="verse"> 'Twas the last sitting week before Christmas<br> And who knew?<br> That Cuzner's Christmas poem tradition<br> Would be assumed by a Jew.<br> <br> But whether we light the menorah<br> Or a big Christmas tree,<br> Parliamentarians are asking for presents<br> On that, we agree. <br> <br> For our Conservative colleagues<br> I know today has been a shock.<br> In the spirit of the holidays<br> l will go straight to the Bloc.<br> <br> </span> <span class="verse"> And for the Bloc leader, flush with success<br> For Mr. Claus he had but one request.<br> When flying over Quebec, please remove that red suit.<br> It is a religious symbol and ugly, to boot.<br> <br> </span> <span class="verse"> For the NDP, pharmacare was on the list.<br> It is supported by the government, but they have requested a twist.<br> They asked Santa, who is known for passing out candy,<br> To put dental care on the agenda. Would that not be dandy?<br> <br> </span> <span class="verse"> And when it comes to our PM<br> We know what he wants, all being equal,<br> No more hot mikes<br> And a new <em>Star Wars</em> sequel.<br> <br> </span> <span class="verse"> I wish all members some holiday cheer.<br> Enjoy your family and friends, and maybe some beer.<br> And when we come back in January, let us see the light,<br> Let us work together for Canadians and let us get it right.<br> </span> </p>
