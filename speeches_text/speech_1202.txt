<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the member for <a data-HoCid="253019" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> for seconding this bill and for her work on this file.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">There is an affordability crisis in child care across the country. Families are struggling to find child care spaces and get on wait lists before their children are even born. Costs are unaffordable in many cities and parents are forced to make impossible choices between delaying their return to work or paying huge amounts for the child care that they need. Liberals have promised an affordable universal child care program for 28 years without action, and women, taking on much of the care work, have been disproportionately impacted by their delay.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Budget 2021 has made several promises and is finally moving forward with establishing a child care program. However, there is still a lack of critical details. I am tabling this bill today to establish the core principles of a universal child care program, one that is based on accountability, quality, universality and accessibility, and to establish the standards needed to meet these principles. </p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">I am calling on the government to work with us in moving child care forward. It is too important not to get right.</p>
