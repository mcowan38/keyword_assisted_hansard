<p data-HoCid="8519908" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8519909" data-originallang="fr">In an article on rising tensions in the Middle East published by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, you said that it was essential to note that the Iranian regime's actions did not reflect the wishes of the Iranian population as a whole, most of whom were seeking peaceful coexistence with other countries in the region.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8519910" data-originallang="fr">My question is quite simple. To what extent does the regime's propaganda towards, say, the state of Israel resonate with the Iranian population?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8519911" data-originallang="fr">From the contacts you still have in the country, how has the Iranian population reacted to Iran's attack on Israel?</p>
