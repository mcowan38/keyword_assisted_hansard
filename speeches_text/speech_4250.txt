<p data-HoCid="8435010" data-originallang="en">Thank you so much for that very important question. Let me mention a few things in the opening. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8435011" data-originallang="en">We now have the majority of provinces, through their ministers of education, committing to mandatory Holocaust education in K-to-12 schools, which is to be implemented in the fall of 2025. We have an enormous opportunity here with the attention in our environment—unfortunately—right now around the issue of anti-Semitism. We have attention on the issue. We have a commitment from provincial ministers of education. In the recent budget, the federal government committed an additional $5 million for the next five years, with $2 million ongoing for Holocaust education. We have excellent commitment and tools in front of us now to get the job done of really allowing our children in K to 12 the opportunity to learn about the Holocaust. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8435012" data-originallang="en">Additionally, for this committee, we also need to ensure this is being tied to a better understanding of modern-day anti-Semitism and how these are connected, and do so in a way that also educates—I must admit—teachers and school boards about modern-day anti-Semitism. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8435013" data-originallang="en">I think, from this committee's perspective, if we could look at making sure that, as this education curriculum rolls out, it also applies to connecting to what hate environments do and the experience we're facing right now of modern-day anti-Semitism. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8435014" data-originallang="en">Thank you. </p>
