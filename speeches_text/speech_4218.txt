<p data-HoCid="8407777" data-originallang="en"> Good morning. Thank you for having me here today. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8407778" data-originallang="en">My name is Sarah Lovegrove. I'm a registered nurse and professor for the Bachelor of Science in nursing program at Vancouver Island University, VIU. I'm grateful to be joining you today from the traditional unceded territory of the Sununeymuxw First Nation, colonially referred to as Nanaimo.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8407779" data-originallang="en">I am also an activist and a member of the Harm Reduction Nurses Association, and I am absolutely infuriated by the federal Ministry of Health's decision to support and enable B.C.'s political move to walk back decriminalization. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8407780" data-originallang="en">Drawing strength from the brave university students using their voice to stand up for justice, including the powerful students at VIU, as well as those at my alma mater, the University of Ottawa, I'll be taking this opportunity today to say what needs to be said. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8407781" data-originallang="en">Much like the genocide of Palestinians in Gaza, this worsening toxic drug crisis, killing 22 Canadians each day, is a result and perpetuation of the ongoing settler colonialism and white supremacy that makes up the fabric of our governments, policies, communities and health care system.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8407782" data-originallang="en"> Indigenous people are disproportionately impacted by this crisis, experiencing death and injury related to an unregulated drug supply at a significantly higher rate than the rest of the population. Substances like alcohol were introduced to the indigenous peoples of Turtle Island at the time of colonization, and have since been weaponized as a tool of coercion and control to uphold the settler state.</p>
