<p data-HoCid="8303047" data-originallang="en"> Obviously, there's a long-standing Russian imperial narrative and a Soviet narrative about Ukraine and Ukrainians that we're struggling against. Our institute, for instance, studies the history of Ukraine, which is a battlefield from beginning to end. We're small in number and we have limited resources, but we do what we can. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8303048" data-originallang="en">One thing we would certainly welcome is the federal government wanting to provide some financing to bring together the Ukrainian, Jewish and Polish communities that were affected, in order to undertake some kind of reconciliation process. That would be very welcome within the community. Right now, as Ihor mentioned, the Ukrainian Jewish Encounter is doing their job as best they can with their resources. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8303049" data-originallang="en">We are tasked with studying the entirety of Ukrainian history. Ukraine also has to deal with rewriting its own history or telling its own story, because these narratives have been written over Ukrainians for centuries, and they're struggling with gradually challenging and correcting this colonial legacy. It's a slow and complicated process. We should remember that World War II is just one part of it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303050" data-originallang="en">If the federal government wanted to provide a push in this direction, I think it would be welcomed by all the communities, not just the Ukrainian community.</p>
