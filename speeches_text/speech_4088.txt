<p data-HoCid="8406064" data-originallang="en"> There's a notion in Western society that Jews are white and that white people are the oppressors. But Jews are not white; we're an indigenous people who come from the land of Israel. We're demonized on campus as being the oppressors, such that people don't want to partake in conversation with us. They're able to label us as Zionists rather than as Jews, and to make that the cause of the ills of the world. We have seen this throughout history: Jews have been demonized for the ills of the world. We were communists and we were capitalists and we were vermin and we took over democratic institutions, and today we're called Zionists.</p>
