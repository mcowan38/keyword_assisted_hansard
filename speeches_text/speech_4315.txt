<p data-HoCid="8414648" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the application by the ICC chief prosecutor to arrest Israel's democratically elected leaders for protecting their country from terrorism, simply put, is outrageous.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8414649" data-originallang="en"> The false equivalency drawn between the elected leaders of a democracy and the dictatorial genocidal Hamas terrorists should be a wake-up call to all western countries as a willful distortion of history. Conservatives unequivocally reject it. What is even more appalling is that the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> opted against taking a clear stance in rejecting it. By playing both sides, he is allowing terrorism to win and is enabling the violence that is rampant in our streets and the chaos that is happening on our campuses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8414650" data-originallang="en">The arrest warrant is based on a falsehood that is trying to invert history, and the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> should, just for once, take a clear position. He should have the courage to denounce the warrant and state unequivocally what side Canada is on. I know he cannot do it, and now everyone else does too.</p>
