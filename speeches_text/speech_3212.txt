<p data-HoCid="8068715" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, more than two million innocent lives remain trapped in Israel's siege of Gaza, trying to survive amid the most horrific and inhumane conditions. Thousands of children have been killed. As a mother, my heart aches for those families.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8068716" data-originallang="en">Survivors are being deprived of clean drinking water, food, medicine, sanitation, fuel and electricity. More than 1.7 million Palestinians are displaced from their homes in their ancestral homeland. Among them are people with disabilities, women, children, seniors and beloved family members of hundreds of people in Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8068717" data-originallang="en">The Australian government has enacted special immigration measures, including a special visa program to prioritize visa assessment for those seeking to depart Gaza. Canada must do the same.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8068718" data-originallang="en">I am calling on the Liberals to immediately enact special immigration measures to facilitate the evacuation of extended family members of Canadians and permanent residents of Gaza, and I renew my call for a permanent ceasefire.</p>
