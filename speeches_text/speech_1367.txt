<p data-HoCid="6934432" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join the debate on this late Friday. It is always an honour to rise in the House, even for only two minutes. I will need to find a Yiddish proverb by the end of my two minutes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6934433" data-originallang="en">Again, I want to thank my constituents for sending me back here. I said that last year after we returned briefly for a session, but it truly is an honour. All of us should recognize, no matter how difficult it is for us outside of here with family and constituents unhappy with positions we sometimes take, what a great honour it is to serve the people of Canada and our great country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6934434" data-originallang="en">We have returned to our hours of work. I now have to wake up at about 5 a.m. in order to ensure I can get ready for question period every day. I truly recognize that fact, so I want to thank my constituents.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6934435" data-originallang="en">This is an important bill. This is one of the top issues I hear about in my riding with emails and phone calls. People are always asking what we are going to do for seniors in this country, or they are seniors themselves and they remind me they helped build this country and are looking to ensure the government meets its obligations toward them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6934436" data-originallang="en">It has become harder. Let us recognize the fact that over the last several years it has become more difficult with the cost of living going up. Seniors are typically on a fixed income and do not have the means to make up the difference. This piece of legislation would be closing a legislative hole that was created by the government.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6934437" data-originallang="en">My time is up, so the Yiddish proverb for the week is actually not Yiddish. I wish the Speaker a very good weekend. To all those who helped us during this difficult week, I thank them for contributing to this great nation of ours.</p>
