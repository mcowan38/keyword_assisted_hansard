Our Canadian institute of Ukrainian studies is in discussions, obviously, with the university administration, and they are in discussion with the Jewish community. We are working towards some kind of a series of research initiatives, discussions, on these topics. Nothing final has been decided yet, but there are signs that there is progress on that and I'm sure that things will move forward.</p>
