<p data-HoCid="8029014" data-originallang="en">As we've said to this committee before, and typically when we're talking about our audit planning and our departmental plan, the independence of the office is important. The ability we have to choose the places we're going to go to is a hallmark of our independence. In this case, this was an audit we decided to do. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8029015" data-originallang="en">We're planning so that it doesn't derail any of our audits that are already started or that are on the books. At this point in time, we don't expect anything will have to be delayed or cancelled. We're going to do this one in addition to the other work we had planned. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8029016" data-originallang="en">To be perfectly honest, we are grabbing our qualified auditors from across the office, including in our services, to be able to help us. We have very skilled people in our services, who moved from the audit practices into there, and they are going to help us out on this. </p>
