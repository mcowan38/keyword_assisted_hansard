<p data-HoCid="8576908" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, the ICJ has a ruling, not on the West Bank but on the genocide claim, that has been cited multiple times by the member for <a data-HoCid="278368" href="/politicians/heather-mcpherson/" title="Heather McPherson">Edmonton Strathcona</a>. I want to quote from a BBC article: The interpretation “that the court had concluded that the claim that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza was ‘plausible’” was disputed and discounted by “Joan Donoghue, the president of the ICJ at the time of that ruling[. She] said in a BBC interview that this was not what the court had ruled.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576909" data-originallang="en">Can I ask the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278248" href="/politicians/michelle-rempel/" title="Michelle Rempel">Calgary Nose Hill</a> if she has any knowledge of that allegation and how it is being interpreted by the NDP versus what it is in reality?</p>
