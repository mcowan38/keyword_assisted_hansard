<p data-HoCid="8281451" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, it is an extraordinary thing to say we are going to force an election that will cost $630 million. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8281452" data-originallang="en">I agree with my hon. colleague that a leader needs the guts to stand up. On Monday night, the <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">leader of the Conservative Party</a> voted nine times in a confidence motion to support the government, but he did it hiding behind the curtain. This was on the night when we had the historic vote on peace in the Middle East and Gaza. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8281453" data-originallang="en">He has a tendency to be missing in action when it is time to stand up. I could not get an answer from the member for Dairy Queen. However, tonight, if he is willing to take the government down, will he actually stand up and be in the House, or will he be off with his lobbyist chief of staff and her lobbyist friends eating canap√©s and getting backhanders?</p>
