<p data-HoCid="8703045" data-originallang="fr">Ms. Kowalski, I'd like you to tell us about the communities and movements you work with in Israel, including groups like Standing Together and Peace Now, who are protesting to demand a ceasefire and a peace agreement, as well as the release of hostages, of course.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703046" data-originallang="fr">What kind of work do you do with those groups?</p>
