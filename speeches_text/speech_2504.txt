<p data-HoCid="7865648" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, it is always a pleasure to welcome the next generation of leaders to Parliament.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7865649" data-originallang="en">Two weeks ago, the Montessori Jewish Day School came to Parliament, and it was wonderful to engage with these young change-makers and answer their terrific questions. Today, I welcome the next generation of women leaders from the Eitz Chaim Girls school to Parliament. They come to see and learn how their House and the democratic institutions we all cherish work, as well as how they can engage with them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7865650" data-originallang="en">June marks graduation season for our students from coast to coast to coast, and the resumption of grad trips, which are the milestones of youth exploring our great country. Our students visit Ottawa to learn about our democratic institutions and nurture their curiosity.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7865651" data-originallang="en">I would like to pay a special tribute to every teacher who has inspired our kids and prepared them for a bright future. I give my congratulations to all our graduates. We are proud of all they have accomplished. <em>Yasher koach</em>.</p>
