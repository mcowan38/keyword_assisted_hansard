<p data-HoCid="7513649" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I rise today on a question of privilege pursuant to Standing Order 48. I would like to speak on that matter at this time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7513650" data-originallang="en">In order for a question of privilege to be accorded precedence over the orders of the day, two conditions must be met. First, the matter must be brought at the earliest opportunity. Second, the Speaker must be convinced that a prima facie breach of privilege has occurred.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7513651" data-originallang="en">With respect to the first condition, the matter arises out of a point of order by the member for <a data-HoCid="278511" href="/politicians/karina-gould/" title="Karina Gould">Burlington</a> on Thursday, December 8, 2022. In her statement, the member for Burlington said that she heard the member for <a data-HoCid="278208" href="/politicians/leslyn-lewis/" title="Leslyn Lewis">Haldimand—Norfolk</a> call another member, a Liberal member, an anti-Semite. As the Speaker was not aware of this, the matter was left with the promise that the Hansard would be consulted and the matter would return to the House if necessary. Today, Tuesday, December 13, 2022, is the earliest opportunity for me to bring forth this matter of privilege.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7513652" data-originallang="en">The second condition is that there must be a prima facie breach of privilege. The House found that the unjust damaging of a member's good name may constitute a form of breach if it affects the performance of parliamentary duties. In 1987, Speaker Fraser found that the privileges of a member “are violated by any action which might impede him or her in the fulfilment of his or her duties and functions”. That is found at page 112 of <em>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</em>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7513653" data-originallang="en">In April 2005, Speaker Milliken ruled that the reputation of a member was unjustly damaged by misleading bulk mail that was mailed into the member's riding.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7513654" data-originallang="en">Also in 2005, a prima facie breach of privilege was found with respect to comments made by the Ethics Commissioner to a journalist about the member for Calgary East.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7513655" data-originallang="en">Most profoundly, the misleading statements of the members and ministers are taken very seriously by this House. On December 6, 1978, Speaker Jerome found that a prima facie contempt of the House existed when a government official deliberately misled the minister, which impeded the member in his performance of his duties.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7513656" data-originallang="en">Last week, on December 8, after Oral Questions, the member for <a data-HoCid="278511" href="/politicians/karina-gould/" title="Karina Gould">Burlington</a> raised an issue that impugns my reputation and hinders my credibility in this House and as a member of Parliament. The member for Burlington actually waited until I had left the chamber after Oral Questions, and I was unable to hear the point of order to defend myself against this very serious accusation made against me.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7513657" data-originallang="en">I was preparing to leave the building when I heard my constituency name and the misinformation that this member raised against me. The member accused me of calling the member for <a data-HoCid="278757" href="/politicians/jenica-atwin/" title="Jenica Atwin">Fredericton</a>, whom I do not know personally and have never met, an anti-Semite while she was asking a question to the <a data-HoCid="278909" href="/politicians/karina-gould/" title="Karina Gould">Minister of Families, Children and Social Development</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7513658" data-originallang="en">This incident shocked me greatly and has shattered my perception of the House as a place of parliamentary decorum and respect. It brings me great concern about how such a divided House can have the capacity to act in the best interests of Canadians. This is the gravity of the situation that compels me to interrupt this House's very important business to raise this question of privilege today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7513659" data-originallang="en">After the member for Burlington brought the false accusation against me, I returned to my seat and was able to rise to state unequivocally that it did not happen. I believe I was unfairly targeted and harmed by this baseless accusation. Let me explain.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7513660" data-originallang="en">On Wednesday, December 7, 2022, the night before this incident happened, I relaunched the Canadian Parliamentary Israel Allies Caucus, a caucus that was formed 15 years ago with the Hon. Stockwell Day, then leader of the Canadian Alliance party, as its founding chairman. I have been honoured to take the helm as chair of this important caucus that is focused on fighting anti-Semitism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7513661" data-originallang="en">As chair of the Canadian Parliamentary Israel Allies Caucus, I take this allegation very seriously, because it is my duty to foster respectful dialogue. Indeed, I have had very respectful and productive conversations about Israel and anti-Semitism with members of the House, such as the Green Party member for <a data-HoCid="278722" href="/politicians/elizabeth-may/" title="Elizabeth May">Saanich—Gulf Islands</a>. We do not always agree, but we have always been respectful and had productive conversations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7513662" data-originallang="en">Curiously, the next day, after the launch of this caucus, I was falsely accused of calling a Liberal member of the House an anti-Semite. I had no idea why anybody would spew that phrase against another member of the House. In fact, I was not aware of any reason until after this incident occurred. I later learned that the member for <a data-HoCid="278757" href="/politicians/jenica-atwin/" title="Jenica Atwin">Fredericton</a> had left the Green Party, which was led by a Black Jewish woman, and had joined the Liberal caucus. That is my current understanding. I was not aware of this context, who she was, or her history before this incident happened. It therefore would have been impossible for me to have called the member for Fredericton an anti-Semite.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7513663" data-originallang="en">Rather, it has been my personal conviction and value to honour and show respect to all my colleagues in the House at all times. I believe it is vital for constructive debate, for the integrity of the House and for the broader unity of this country. However, what I fear is that this incident highlights the toxic environment the Liberals have brought to this Parliament. It also highlights the level of pomposity that is inherent in their style of government.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7513664" data-originallang="en">It is a tone set from the very top. The government has made the politics of division its playbook. I remind members of the House that it was the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> who laid the foundation for this kind of unacceptable behaviour by implying that the member for <a data-HoCid="278731" href="/politicians/melissa-lantsman/" title="Melissa Lantsman">Thornhill</a>, a proud Jewish woman, was standing with Nazis during the trucker convoy protest earlier this year.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7513665" data-originallang="en">The toxic environment fuelled by the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> is in danger of bringing the House into contempt. We are all required to treat our colleagues in the House with respect, because we are all hon. members. There is nothing honourable about misleading the House and hurling false accusations against its members, and I fear that the member for <a data-HoCid="278511" href="/politicians/karina-gould/" title="Karina Gould">Burlington</a> deliberately misled this House and knowingly brought forward false information against me.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7513666" data-originallang="en">She chose her words very carefully. She said she specifically heard me say something that it was impossible to have heard, because I did not say it. In fact, I did not utter one word when the member for <a data-HoCid="278757" href="/politicians/jenica-atwin/" title="Jenica Atwin">Fredericton</a> asked her question. I was silent, yet the member for Burlington misled the House by stating that I called the member for Fredericton an anti-Semite, and that she heard me say it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7513667" data-originallang="en">Therefore, I find it very difficult to come to any other conclusion than that the member for <a data-HoCid="278511" href="/politicians/karina-gould/" title="Karina Gould">Burlington</a> misled the House deliberately, and if this action goes unpunished, any member of the House could falsely hurl an accusation at another member and say they said something they did not say. This is very serious and poses the risk of bringing the entire House into disrepute.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7513668" data-originallang="en">Consequently, I am going to ask that the member for <a data-HoCid="278511" href="/politicians/karina-gould/" title="Karina Gould">Burlington</a> be found in contempt of the House. I also ask for, and expect, an apology from the member for falsely accusing me.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7513669" data-originallang="en">If you review the statement made by the member, Mr. Speaker, you will clearly hear her say that if she was mistaken, she would apologize. The question is this. If she heard me say what she said I said, how could she have been mistaken?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7513670" data-originallang="en">It was during that same day that my colleague, the member for <a data-HoCid="278424" href="/politicians/raquel-dancho/" title="Raquel Dancho">Kildonan—St. Paul</a>, was penalized and asked to leave the House just minutes before I was accused. I expect equal treatment in the House toward the member for <a data-HoCid="278511" href="/politicians/karina-gould/" title="Karina Gould">Burlington</a>. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7513671" data-originallang="en">The House is in danger of losing the confidence of the Canadian people, one-third of whom chose not to vote in the last election. Many Canadians are choosing not to even be involved in politics because of the pettiness they see in the House. Its behaviour, as was displayed by the member for <a data-HoCid="278511" href="/politicians/karina-gould/" title="Karina Gould">Burlington</a>, has fostered the decline of confidence in our democratic institutions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7513672" data-originallang="en"> We must be accountable to the public for the falsehoods that we spread in the House as elected officials and the powerful and negative impact that our statements have not only on the reputations of our members and colleagues in the House, but with respect to the integrity of the entire House of Commons. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7513673" data-originallang="en">That is why this incident rises to the level of justifying a prima facie case of a breach of privilege. I am asking that you allow the House, Mr. Speaker, to consider further making determinations as to whether that member, the member for <a data-HoCid="278511" href="/politicians/karina-gould/" title="Karina Gould">Burlington</a>, should be held in contempt of the House.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7513674" data-originallang="en"> Should you find that there is a prima facie case, Mr. Speaker, I would be prepared to move the appropriate motion. As a member of the House, I view as my primary duty the duty to safeguard the integrity of the House by challenging acts that compromise its reputation. Misleading the House is a serious act and if it is left unpunished, it will bring the entire House and its members into disrepute.</p>
