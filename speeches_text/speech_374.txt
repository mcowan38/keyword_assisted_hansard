<p data-HoCid="6286667" data-originallang="en">Before we proceed, you've proposed, as I understand it, three amendments to the motion: the first, to reduce the amount of time for witnesses from 10 minutes to five for their remarks; the second, to afford them the opportunity to provide their opening statements 72 hours in advance; and the third, to change the speaking order in the second and subsequent rounds to move the Bloc Québécois and New Democratic Party from fifth and sixth to third and fourth.</p>
