<p data-HoCid="6672162" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, today I wish to honour one of my heroes, my niece Hannah Turner. Hannah is a leader, courageous, kind, loving, wise, and at only 18 years of age, she has continued to rise in spite of uncontrollable life circumstances, losing her father at age 11, and supporting her mother, my courageous sister Sarah Gazan, through two bouts of breast cancer.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6672163" data-originallang="en">She is a basketball star, an A-plus student, a mentor, a friend and a leader who walks on the earth in non-judgment. Hannah is so funny, a brilliant writer and such a dear friend to me. Hannah gives me hope that we will achieve a better world for all. Hannah has vision and walks through life with dignity. Hannah is graduating this year at the top of her class.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6672164" data-originallang="en">I love Hannah. She makes auntie so proud. She is my hero.</p>
