<p data-HoCid="6695918" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, this month of May marks Jewish Heritage Month. Jews throughout Canada's history have made extraordinary contributions to the fabric of our nation and have helped make it the greatest country in the world. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6695919" data-originallang="en">Whether it be the Bronfman family and their contributions in business and philanthropy; in politics and government with former minister of finance Joe Oliver; in the entertainment world with the likes of none other than Captain James T. Kirk, captain of the Starship Enterprise, William Shatner; or, for the younger crowd out there, Canada's own superstar, Grammy award-winning singer-songwriter Drake, the Canadian Jewish community has made significant contributions to the growth and prosperity of Canada while overcoming tremendous obstacles.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6695920" data-originallang="en">This month, let us remember to celebrate and educate future generations about the inspirational role that Jewish Canadians have played and continue to play in communities across the country. On behalf of our entire Conservative team, I want to wish a happy Jewish Heritage Month to my fellow Jewish Canadians across the country.</p>
