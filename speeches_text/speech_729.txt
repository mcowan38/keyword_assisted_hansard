<p data-HoCid="6566228" data-originallang="en">Thanks, Ms. Gazan, for your question. I'm going to try to answer it as quickly as I can.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6566229" data-originallang="en">There was included in the original Constitution the idea to try to negotiate additional understanding of section 35 through those constitutional round tables that were going to look at self-government, and those didn't succeed. We've had the very unfortunate situation in Canada where a broad general phrase, “aboriginal and treaty rights”, is what is protected in the Constitution, and with unsuccessful negotiations, you're right, it was left to the courts to determine. We continue to have litigation over the scope of these rights and some negotiations as well.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6566230" data-originallang="en">I do think that <a data-HoCid="11007812" href="/bills/43-2/C-15/" title="An Act respecting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">Bill C-15</a> and the UN declaration provide some useful supports, because they help flesh out that general understanding of what aboriginal treaty rights are. There's a whole list of rights that are included with the UN declaration that help us understand. I would just say, importantly, from my perspective, the inclusion of the economic, social and cultural rights as well as civil and political rights is really important, particularly when we think of indigenous women. I think the national inquiry as well as the B.C. inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women highlight the way in which economic, social and cultural rights are particularly important for indigenous women and to ensure equality. We haven't seen as much success in litigating economic, social and cultural rights in either the Constitution or the Charter, so I do think there's a lot of clarity that can be gained through Bill C-15.</p>
