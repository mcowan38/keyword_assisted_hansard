<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, finally, I would like to present e-petition 3810, initiated by David Mivasair from my riding of Hamilton Centre, which seeks to bring attention to the recruiting of Canadian citizens to serve in the armed forces of foreign countries, with a particular concern for the potential foreign recruitment being undertaken by the Israeli consulate in Toronto.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">As members may be aware, the Foreign Enlistment Act states:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en"> Any person who, within Canada, recruits or otherwise induces any person or body of persons to enlist or to accept any commission or engagement in the armed forces of [a] foreign state or other armed forces operating in that state is guilty of an offence. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">This petition has had the support of more than 1,200 people, and a similar e-petition in the previous Parliament received close to 8,000 signatures. We were unable to table it due to the dissolution of Parliament.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">This petition calls on the <a data-HoCid="245291" href="/politicians/david-lametti/" title="David Lametti">Minister of Justice</a> to undertake a thorough investigation of those who have recruited or facilitated recruitment for the Israel Defense Forces, and, if warranted, lay charges against those involved in recruitment and encouraging recruitment in the IDF.</p>
