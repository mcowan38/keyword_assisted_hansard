<p data-HoCid="8455716" data-originallang="fr">Good afternoon, everyone.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455717" data-originallang="en">Thank you for the opportunity to speak before the committee today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455718" data-originallang="en">The issue of anti-Semitism is so important, and this discussion is timely.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455719" data-originallang="en">I began my term as president of UBC on November 1, 2023, three weeks afer the tragic and horrific events of October 7. My first message to the university community five days later was on the conflict in Israel, and we have remained vigilant and engaged since.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455720" data-originallang="en">Today, I state unequivocally that anti-Semitism is completely unacceptable at UBC and anywhere, and I will speak to our commitments and actions in support of this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455721" data-originallang="en">I also refer you to my letter of January 19, 2024, to MP Housefather and others, in response to the legitimate questions they raised about anti-Semitism at universities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455722" data-originallang="en">We are facing difficult and distressing times around the world. We see individuals and communities deeply affected by the war and violence in Israel and Gaza.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455723" data-originallang="en">UBC is part of a global society with a diverse community of almost 90,000 people. Every global event affects some members of our community. They evoke trauma, loss and a wide range of complex emotions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455724" data-originallang="en">I am grateful that the overwhelming majority of our community—no, not everyone, sadly—has remained respectful and compassionate towards one another as the conflict has unfolded.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455725" data-originallang="en">Universities are also places of debate, sometimes protests, often sparked by global events. Recently, UBC students began to take part in a broader movement that started in the United States and has now spread to Canada and all around the world. It's a very challenging situation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455726" data-originallang="en">UBC supports freedom of expression and the right to demonstrate. However, we do not condone behaviours that affect the safety and security of our university community or threaten or interfere with our operations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455727" data-originallang="en">We are doing all we can. It's extremely challenging. It's a truly difficult situation, but let me assure everyone that anti-Semitism and any form of harassment and discrimination have no place at UBC.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455728" data-originallang="en">We have a responsibility and a shared obligation to create a learning and working environment where divergent and conflicting viewpoints can peacefully coexist. This is our mission.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455729" data-originallang="en">There are a number of policies and measures that UBC has put in place to support and strengthen a safe and respectful environment.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455730" data-originallang="en">First and foremost is UBC’s discrimination policy, which governs our approach to discrimination on the basis of religion, race or place of origin, and is implemented in a manner consistent with how B.C.’s courts and human rights tribunal implement B.C.’s human rights code.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455731" data-originallang="en">The university reviews all reported incidents of discrimination. Complaints of criminal hate speech can be directed to the RCMP for criminal investigation and potential prosecution. The UBC student code of conduct sets out the standards that are expected of students and holds individuals and groups responsible for the consequences of their actions. Where a breach of these codes occurs, there's a range of potential disciplinary outcomes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455732" data-originallang="en">Over the past year, we have also enhanced campus security. We conduct ongoing risk assessments and situational reports to make sure we take appropriate measures to keep everyone in our community safe.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455733" data-originallang="en">Over the months, I've met with Jewish students, faculty members and community members, as has my senior administration, to understand their concerns and consider how the university can best address them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455734" data-originallang="en">We have engaged over that time with Hillel BC, which is on campus, the Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver, the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, the special envoy on preserving Holocaust remembrance and combatting anti-Semitism, the Jewish Faculty Network, the Jewish Medical Association of BC, and the Jewish Academic Alliance of British Columbia.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455735" data-originallang="en">We also work closely with UBC student organizations to emphasize that our shared mission must include the protection of space for respectful debate and compassionate dialogue. It's not easy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455736" data-originallang="en">UBC also provides community members with a range of supports, including academic and workplace accommodations, emergency funds, safety planning and professional support services, including counselling.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455737" data-originallang="en">The university also works very closely with Hillel BC and with individual Jewish students to address concerns that are raised and through initiatives to improve the experience of Jewish students on campus. This, of course, includes responding to reported incidents of anti-Semitism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455738" data-originallang="en">We have also increased efforts to disseminate resources for faculty and staff on fostering respect, inclusion, safety and critical constructive dialogue in the classroom and workplace.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455739" data-originallang="en">Everybody, this is a challenging time globally, and we fully recognize the concerns around anti-Semitism that the committee is studying. It was important for me to be here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455740" data-originallang="en">Anti-Semitism has a long and terrible history, and we must always remain vigilant. Again, anti-Semitism has no place at UBC. It's our collective responsibility to do better and to find solutions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455741" data-originallang="fr">Thank you very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455742" data-originallang="en"> Thank you for the opportunity to speak today.</p>
