<p data-HoCid="8493839" data-originallang="en">I think committee members are correct to say that it's not up to us to determine the minister's availability. All we can do, of course, is ask. The minister will say, “No, I'm sorry. I can't come, but here's an alternate date.” I think we should really just make the ask and see what the minister comes back with. This is normal practice.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8493840" data-originallang="en">We try to get the supplementaries done as soon as we can, and we have already had to delay that timeline because of other urgent studies, such as the Gaza and Sudan situations. When the minister showed up last time, we talked about that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8493841" data-originallang="en">I think it's fair to make this request of the minister, and then they'll come back to us and tell us about his availability.</p>
