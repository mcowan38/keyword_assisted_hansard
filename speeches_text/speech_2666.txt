<p data-HoCid="7957800" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I want to start by sharing how much I appreciate that the member for <a data-HoCid="278601" href="/politicians/julie-dabrusin/" title="Julie Dabrusin">Torontoâ€”Danforth</a> spoke from her heart tonight during such a difficult time for her as a Jewish Canadian.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957801" data-originallang="en">In her comments, she spoke about empathy for Palestinian people. As she likely knows, there are hospitals, for example, in Gaza right now that are on the brink of running out of backup generator power. Can she speak to her reflections on what can be done to protect innocent lives in Palestine?</p>
