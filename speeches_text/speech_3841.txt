<p data-HoCid="8285103" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, the Liberals said last year that they were working on it. Yesterday the<a data-HoCid="300017" href="/politicians/dominic-leblanc/" title="Dominic LeBlanc"> minister</a> changed the story, citing that his agency did not even give him that advice. Today I do not understand that answer, neither will Canadians, so what answer is it, which story?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8285104" data-originallang="en">There is a minister over there who will not condemn the most vile anti-Semitism, and another minister who held hands with a literal terrorist. Is there no courage at all?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8285105" data-originallang="en">I am going to ask one more time: On what day will you list the IRGC as the terrorist organization it is in this country?</p>
