<p data-HoCid="8679254" data-originallang="en">The Oslo framework is still valid. The discussions that have been held over the 30 years to resolve the five final status issues, and those issues remain, are still valid. Unfortunately, the Oslo process was stalled. The second intifada occurred, which turned off many Israelis who were in favour of peace.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679255" data-originallang="en">I don't want to put all the blame for the failure of Oslo on Israel. I don't want to put all the blame on the Palestinians. There is plenty of blame to go around, but as I said before, it doesn't mean that we shouldn't be trying again now. On the framework and the various discussions that have taken place over 30 years with Clinton, with Carter, with Prime Minister Olmertâ€”all of those discussions and issues that were discussed and brought to the table are ready to be discussed again. </p>
