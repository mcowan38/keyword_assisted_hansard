<p data-HoCid="8784186" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8784187" data-originallang="fr">I too want to thank our witnesses for joining us today to talk about this subject, which can give rise to considerable debate. I'm delighted we have two very interesting witnesses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8784188" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Robertson, I too am going to ask you some questions, if I may. You talked about terrorist groups being glorified at rallies. Lately, I'm hearing a lot about the rise in anti-Semitism, but we're also seeing a rise in Islamophobia.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8784189" data-originallang="fr">Since October 7, 2023, do you believe there are as many anti-Israel protests as there are anti-Palestinian, Anti-Arab or Islamophobia demonstrations per se? What's your opinion as an interested observer? Do you note a rise, too, in anti-Semitism and Islamophobia in Quebec and Canada?</p>
