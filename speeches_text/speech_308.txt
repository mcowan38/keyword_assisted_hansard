<p data-HoCid="6309749" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to put this very significant question forward. I appreciated the points made yesterday by the member for <a data-HoCid="252827" href="/politicians/michael-chong/" title="Michael Chong">Wellingtonâ€”Halton Hills</a>. We are looking at a humanitarian crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh. The Armenian population is being decimated. Ceasefires fall apart before they start.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6309750" data-originallang="en">Does the Government of Canada think it is a deficiency in our ability to deal in this crisis that we have no diplomatic presence in the region? We are doing what we can, and I applaud stopping military sales, but Turkey and Israel are sending arms to Azerbaijan. Surely we should be more active and on the ground with a diplomatic presence.</p>
