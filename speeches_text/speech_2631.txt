<p data-HoCid="7957617" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Chair, I never thought that one day I would have to rise in the House to speak about such tragic events.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957618" data-originallang="fr">There is something that I have found surprising all evening: Some have tried to dehumanize what happened on October 7 by talking about an attack on Israel, forgetting that it was an attack on women and children who were subjected to unspeakable acts, on fathers who fought to the death to protect their families, on elderly people who asked for nothing more than to go on living, and on people who were going to celebrate peace nearby. The attack on Israel is first and foremost a terrorist attack on people and on civilians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957619" data-originallang="fr">Does my colleague agree with me that Hamas, which is behind this despicable, sadistic, and unspeakable attack, needs to be completely eliminated, and that Israel has the right to hunt it down to ensure the safety of Israeli civilians, whatever the cost?</p>
