<p data-HoCid="8598605" data-originallang="en"> Madam Speaker, that response was reprehensible, with more empty words and platitudes. I would say that it was a joke, but this is no laughing matter; it is an issue of safety for Canadians. How seriously does the government take something if it does literally nothing? </p>
<p data-HoCid="8598606" data-originallang="en">Canadians do not need another action plan; they need action. The Liberals are boasting about another review when this organization has talked about how they have links to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, another terror organization on Canada's designated terror list. I do not want a list of stuff that the government can do but has not done.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8598607" data-originallang="en">When will the government take action? More importantly, if something happens, will the government take responsibility for its inaction?</p>
