<p data-HoCid="7280981" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, we're acting in a slightly committee-of-the-whole fashion right now, which sometimes works, but we have not moved into that. I think it would be helpful if we knew what amendment was going to be proposed, even though that is a little unusual. I don't want to go down a rabbit hole where I don't know where I'm going.</p>
