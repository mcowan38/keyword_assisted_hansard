<p data-HoCid="8381043" data-originallang="en">Mr. Kalensk√Ω, my first question is for you. On October 7, Hamas terrorists attacked Israel, creating the biggest massacre of Jews since the Second World War and the Holocaust. Since then, there's been a great increase in anti-Semitism all across the world, including here in North America, where today college campuses are being occupied by people spreading anti-Semitic messaging. How has Russia been involved in fomenting that happening?</p>
