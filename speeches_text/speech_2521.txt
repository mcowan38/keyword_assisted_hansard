<p data-HoCid="7929495" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I was honoured to introduce the national Holocaust monument bill in the House, which received unanimous support from all parties.

<p data-HoCid="7929496" data-originallang="en">When will the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> stand up, take responsibility for this massive insult and apologize to Canadians?</p>
