<p data-HoCid="8507754" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> divides to distract. He turns groups against each other. He fans the flames. He gave funds to an anti-Semitic Holocaust denier. Even before October 7, hate crimes were up 162%. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8507755" data-originallang="en">Since, we have seen the rise of Hamas-inspired hate camps at university campuses that intimidate Jewish students and promote genocide. Will the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> finally summon the courage to join with me and call for these hate camps to be shut down and closed up so that students can safely go back to school?</p>
