<p data-HoCid="8555691" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, Khaled Barakat is a member of Samidoun and a leader of designated terrorist group Popular Front for Liberation of Palestine. Barakat was banned from entering the EU, and Germany banned Samidoun outright, yet in Canada, Barakat is free to spew hatred. At one rally, he said Canada should condemn the killing of terrorist leaders and that he hopes for Israel's destruction.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8555692" data-originallang="en"> Will the Liberal government take action to have Barakat arrested for hate propaganda and list Samidoun as a terrorist organization, or will it continue to be a doormat?</p>
