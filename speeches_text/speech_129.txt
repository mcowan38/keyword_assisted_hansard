<p data-HoCid="6150359" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, for welcoming CIJA's participation in this important conversation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6150360" data-originallang="en">The Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, known widely as CIJA, is the advocacy agent of the Jewish Federations of Canada. We're a national, non-partisan, non-profit organization representing over 150,000 Jewish Canadians affiliated through local federations from coast to coast. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6150361" data-originallang="en">Federations are in many ways the United Way of the Jewish community. They're a one-stop shop for philanthropic giving, enabling community members to support the diversity of charitable projects. Canada's Jewish federations collectively raise well over $120 million every year for services, programs and initiatives to support the most vulnerable Canadians from all walks of life. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6150362" data-originallang="en">The beneficiaries include people with disabilities, low-income families, seniors, Holocaust survivors, youth, education and cultural programs, and in the wake of this pandemic, emergency initiatives and programs to support those impacted by COVID-19. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6150363" data-originallang="en">Jewish federations are the central pillar of Jewish life in Canada, sustaining our vibrant community. The service agencies and community institutions they support have been conducting essential front-line work since this crisis began.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6150364" data-originallang="en">I'd be remiss by not beginning with a strong expression of deep appreciation to the government officials, ministers, members of Parliament and political staff who have worked countless hours to design and implement programs that we're discussing here today. The government has to be commended for the work it has done. It has saved millions of Canadians from financial ruin and worse, as we combat the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6150365" data-originallang="en">It's in that spirit that I appear here today to address constructively several shortcomings in the programs and offer our solutions to them. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6150366" data-originallang="en">As was the case during past crises, Canadians should come together during this time with the understanding the government alone cannot resolve this crisis. We all have to collectively step up to the plate and work together to help the most vulnerable among us to get through this unprecedented challenge.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6150367" data-originallang="en">The strength of the partnerships among government, civil society, the private sector and the charitable and not-for-profit sectors will determine the extent to which Canadians are able to get through this crisis and move toward recovery and renewal. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6150368" data-originallang="en">In the spirit of partnership, I would like to highlight a number of areas where government programs and the partnership between government and front-line community-led initiatives can be strengthened. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6150369" data-originallang="en">The first issue is the accessibility of the Canada emergency wage subsidy for the not-for-profit and charitable sector, which remains largely excluded from this crucial program due to eligibility requirements. The requirement to demonstrate a 30% reduction in revenue within a one-month period is causing a serious challenge within the sector. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6150370" data-originallang="en">This sector survives on seasonal fundraising campaigns, donations and grants. Fluctuating revenue streams make it exceedingly difficult to demonstrate the required 30% reduction in revenue within a one-month time frame, and seasonal businesses such as summer camps and schools are in a similarly perilous position in their ability to demonstrate this reduction in revenue. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6150371" data-originallang="en">Our recommendation is to allow organizations and seasonal businesses unable to demonstrate this reduction within one month to receive the subsidy based on a 12-month period. If after 12 months they don't meet the 30% reduction, they will pay back a prorated amount based on the differential between the 30% and their actual shortfall. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6150372" data-originallang="en">I'd like to highlight two ways in which the shortcomings of CEWS eligibility will directly impact our population, one which has been largely absent from the conversation about CEWS, and that's our children. Twice they will be affected by these shortcomings: first during the school year and then during the summer. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6150373" data-originallang="en">Many of us here today are sitting in home offices while our children sit in a virtual Zoom classroom. The school year has continued, albeit online, because public schools have retained their teaching staff. The situation with private schools, however, is different. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6150374" data-originallang="en">There are numerous reasons parents send their children to private schools. It may be that they believe in a school's educational philosophy, or the child may have unique learning needs, or the parents may seek to preserve their child's cultural and linguistic heritage as part of our multicultural mosaic. These parents are increasingly struggling to pay tuition. The reason is the high cost. Private schools, which rely on revenue from tuition to pay teachers, specialists and other core educational staff, are experiencing mounting financial pressure. Even a virtual classroom needs a teacher. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6150375" data-originallang="en">Accessing CEWS would alleviate this pressure; however, CEWS eligibility has become muddled when it comes to private schools. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6150376" data-originallang="en"> Because of a contradiction in the criteria set out by the government, private schools are being erroneously categorized as public institutions because the criteria do not differentiate between public and private schools. Private schools, however, are not public institutions nor are they funded in the same ways as public schools. Many of them are registered charities or not-for-profits, which are eligible for CEWS. It is noteworthy that the current government criteria differentiate between public and private universities. The same clarification should be made for public and private schools</p>
<p data-HoCid="6150377" data-originallang="en">Compounding this issue are instances of CRA officials giving contradictory advice directly to private schools. This is a dire issue for many parents. We cannot allow students to be denied access to quality education because their school was unable to retain its teaching staff through the pandemic period due to the ambiguity in the wage subsidy program.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6150378" data-originallang="en">The second instance of children being impacted by the shortcomings of the wage subsidy is quickly approachingâ€”summer camp and summer schools. These providers of formative experiences, environmental education and lasting memories for our children are struggling to meet the requirements necessary to access CEWS, just as not-for-profits and charities are. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6150379" data-originallang="en">As seasonal businesses, summer camps are caught in a perilous situation: They make the majority of their revenue within only a few months. This means thousands of children may be home this summer, including children from low-income families who, through financial assistance, could access the same experiences as other children, and those with physical or developmental disabilities who experience the joys of summer camp through specialized programs. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6150380" data-originallang="en">For camps to be closed due to the health risks stemming from COVID-19 is understandable; for the entire camping industry to be financially ruined because their revenue structure makes them ineligible for CEWS is not.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6150381" data-originallang="en">The wage subsidy was meant to provide necessary assistance to Canadian employers, including not-for-profits, charities and seasonal businesses. Whether they are restricted by the required one-month loss in revenue or the unclear wording in the eligibility criteria, it is vital that government rectify these issues in order to avoid an unintended negative impact on Canadian children.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6150382" data-originallang="en">The second issue is the rapidly increasing demand on the services of not-for-profits and charities. This increase is occurring alongside a reduction in resources, donations and employees. The widening gap between the demand and the resources will directly impact the most vulnerable in our communities. The needs of the not-for-profit and charitable sector must not be an afterthought. The sector is central in our ability to get through this crisis and will be a pillar in our rebuilding.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6150383" data-originallang="en">The $350 million provided by the emergency community support fund is an important step, but more must be done. We are recommending the establishment of a direct granting program of approximately $4 billion to $6 billion to ensure the critical services provided by these organizations and agencies can continue. A strategic investment in this sector would benefit all Canadians and would ease the burden on governments at all levels.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6150384" data-originallang="en">Having established the centrality of the charitable and not-for-profit sector, I offer our third and final recommendation: support for charitable giving. This reinforces the importance of the vital partnership between government and individual Canadians in getting our country back on its feet. The feeling of civic obligation and community values is strong among Canadians, and those who are able to provide assistance are asking how they can do so. Now is the time to harness this energy and generosity of spirit. The government has a crucial role to play in encouraging all Canadians to support charitable organizations, even those Canadians who, because of the crisis, have diminished capacity to give. This can be achieved by temporarily enhancing the tax credit for charitable giving, which would provide a lifeline for charities struggling to continue operations at a time when their services are needed most.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6150385" data-originallang="en">A second way is through a donor matching program whereby the government matches donations from Canadians to the charitable sector. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6150386" data-originallang="en">Both of these options would provide crucial assistance to the sector while empowering Canadians to partner with the government and support the most vulnerable among us through this unprecedented crisis and towards recovery.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6150387" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, once again I'd like to thank committee members for considering our perspective and for your dedication to ensuring that public policy effectively supports the charitable sector. I too would welcome any questions, comments or reflections.</p>
