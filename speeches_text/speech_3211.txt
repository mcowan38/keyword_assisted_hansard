<p data-HoCid="8068678" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, today is recognized by the United Nations as International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8068679" data-originallang="en">For over 70 years, Palestinians have been living under occupation, robbed of their fundamental rights, with no regard for human dignity. This is the most terrible year, with thousands of Palestinians, including thousands of children, killed in front of our eyes. Western democracies have not taken any measures to prevent this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8068680" data-originallang="en"> Today, I and millions of Canadians are angry, frustrated and feeling helpless with our unsuccessful advocacy to get Canada to change its position and do what is just and right. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8068681" data-originallang="en">I call on Canada to ask for a permanent ceasefire and take the right step forward, starting with the recognition of the sovereign state of Palestine, for a two-state solution. </p>
