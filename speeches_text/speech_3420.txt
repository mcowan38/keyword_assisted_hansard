<p data-HoCid="8178751" data-originallang="en"> <em>Uqaqtittiji</em>, as I listen to the interventions and think back to the effectiveness of the NDP in this 44th Parliament, I think about, for example, what the MP for <a data-HoCid="278710" href="/politicians/jenny-kwan/" title="Jenny Kwan">Vancouver East</a> and I have done in securing $4 billion over seven years for urban, rural and northern housing. I think about the member of Parliament for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> who got unanimous consent by all of Parliament that residential schools are a form of genocide.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8178752" data-originallang="en">Having said that, I am struck by the fact that there are 24 Liberal MPs who represent Toronto and the general area of Toronto alone. What I am asking is this: Why have they failed to take action to stop criminals from stealing cars?</p>
