<p data-HoCid="8043020" data-originallang="en">I was speaking about food, fuel and the impacts on the citizens of Gaza.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8043021" data-originallang="en">One thing I would also like to highlight is that currently the member for <a data-HoCid="278442" href="/politicians/garnett-genuis/" title="Garnett Genuis">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</a> is filibustering the natural resources committee, where we are trying to get a piece of legislation through that would help Albertans with jobs, and perhaps the energy sector would be more applicable in that particular circumstance.</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8043022" data-originallang="en"> Day by day, hundreds of innocent civilians are being killed in ongoing violence. The following organizations urge the government of Canada to take a strong and resolute stance in demanding a ceasefire in order to prevent further loss of civilian life and allow for the delivery of critical humanitarian assistance: CARE Canada, Cooperation Canada, Development and Peace, Human Concern International, Humanity &amp; Inclusion, Islamic Relief Canada, Oxfam Canada, Oxfam-Québec, Médecins du Monde Canada, Mennonite Central Committee Canada, and Save the Children. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8043023" data-originallang="en"> The lives of two million people are at stake. The healthcare system in Gaza is collapsing, hospitals are devastated and lack the capacity to treat the tens of thousands...wounded. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8043024" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, Canada should be calling for a ceasefire. I'm disappointed that both the Liberals and the Conservatives refuse to give consent for that ceasefire motion in the House of Commons.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8043025" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much.</p>
