<p data-HoCid="7741373" data-originallang="en"> <em>Uqaqtittiji</em>, I am pleased to represent Nunavut regarding Bill <a data-HoCid="12260777" href="/bills/44-1/C-318/" title="An Act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and the Canada Labour Code (adoptive and intended parents)">C-318</a>, an act to amend the Employment Insurance Act, as introduced by the hon. member of Parliament for <a data-HoCid="278203" href="/politicians/rosemarie-falk/" title="Rosemarie Falk">Battlefords—Lloydminster</a>. <em>Qujannamiik</em> to the member for introducing this bill.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7741374" data-originallang="en">New Democrats support this bill. It would create a 15-week attachment leave benefit for adoptive and intended parents, through the employment insurance system. During my speech, I will describe benefits for children, parents and overall Canadian society. I will describe troubling realities substantiating the need for Bill <a data-HoCid="12260777" href="/bills/44-1/C-318/" title="An Act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and the Canada Labour Code (adoptive and intended parents)">C-318</a> to be passed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7741375" data-originallang="en">It is unfortunate that it has reached the House as a private member’s bill, given that in 2019, and again in the last election, the Liberals promised to introduce legislation in this area. Regardless, we will continue to hold the Liberal government accountable to its promises brought by this bill. The NDP is committed to ensuring that all parents and caregivers, whether biological, adoptive, intended, customary or kinship, can spend time at home with their children in the critical first year.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7741376" data-originallang="en">Research shows that the quality of a child’s attachment impacts the overall health and development of the child. The benefits of passing this bill will be most prominent for children. Children with strong attachments are more likely to form strong relationships with peers, be better able to regulate their emotions and be less dependent on their caregivers.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7741377" data-originallang="en">I have personal experience. I strongly believe that, because of the strong bonds that were created in the early years of my life, I have been able to cope with the adversity I was forced to experience later in my life. Parents adopting and those intending to be parents need to receive the same benefits, so that adopted children can have the same sense of coping for their future. I have seen the benefits of ensuring those strong bonds early in life, through watching my grandchildren bonding with their parents in the time spent together early in their lives.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7741378" data-originallang="en">Adoption is an important practice in Nunavut, and providing this benefit will help many of my constituents. Unfortunately, Bill <a data-HoCid="12260777" href="/bills/44-1/C-318/" title="An Act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and the Canada Labour Code (adoptive and intended parents)">C-318</a> does not reflect our customary adoption practices. While the bill is an important step in the right direction, it does not include kinship and customary caregivers, which are particularly important for Métis, first nations and Inuit.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7741379" data-originallang="en">Kinship and customary care reflect indigenous culture and traditions, and are an alternative to foster care or group home placements. We want to ensure that an attachment leave benefit is inclusive of kinship and customary caregivers, as well as adoptive and intended parents.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7741380" data-originallang="en">Providing parents or caregivers with an additional attachment leave benefit so that they can develop these stronger attachments is crucial for children’s well-being. This benefit would provide adoptive and intended parents with much-needed financial security and improve outcomes for children, many of whom are over the age of 10 at the time of placement and have a history of trauma and loss.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7741381" data-originallang="en">Providing a 15-week paid attachment leave would ease the burden being placed on women who are adoptive or intended parents or kinship and customary caregivers. Providing them with the financial support they need would help ensure stronger attachments with their adopted or intended children.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7741382" data-originallang="en">The societal benefits would be seen with a healthier Canada, in children who are able to enter the school system prepared and ready to adjust to a world where they can learn to have friendships and learn to realize the importance of becoming contributing members of society. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7741383" data-originallang="en">The need to pass Bill <a data-HoCid="12260777" href="/bills/44-1/C-318/" title="An Act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and the Canada Labour Code (adoptive and intended parents)">C-318</a> is evident in the disproportionate amount of unpaid caregiving work that takes place in this country, mostly on the part of women. Indeed, more than half of women in Canada give care to children and dependent adults, and almost one-third give unpaid care to children. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7741384" data-originallang="en">New Democrats will support this bill, work to improve it so that it includes kinship and customary caregivers, and hold the Liberals accountable to deliver on their promises to ensure that adoptive and intended parents get the benefits they deserve.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7741385" data-originallang="en"> I would like to conclude by sharing what we as New Democrats have heard from important agencies across Canada. The Child and Youth Permanency Council and Adopt4Life are calling for the creation of a new, paid, 15-week attachment leave benefit to adoptive and intended parents and kinship and customary caregivers. I very much appreciate their Time to Attach campaign, which has been effective in building public support for this change.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7741386" data-originallang="en">I thank my NDP colleague, the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>, who had a petition on the 15-week attachment leave benefit. It garnered so much support by many. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7741387" data-originallang="en">Julie Despaties, from Adopt4Life, has said:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7741388" data-originallang="en"> Canada’s current parental leave program does not recognize the unique attachment needs of children and youth joining adoptive families and is creating avoidable harms. We need this change, so families are no longer disadvantaged because they are formed through adoption. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7741389" data-originallang="en">Finally, Cathy Murphy, the chairperson of the Child and Youth Permanency Council of Canada, said:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7741390" data-originallang="en"> The Child and Youth Permanency Council of Canada is pleased to see Private Member's Bill C-318 from [the member of Parliament for Battlefords—Lloydminster] brought to first reading. Equitable attachment leave for adoptive parents, customary and kinship caregivers is long overdue, and we look forward to seeing these EI revisions. </p>
