<p data-HoCid="8324528" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I cannot keep up with the multiple positions of the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> or her inability to ever talk about this issue without being naive.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8324529" data-originallang="en">I could not do that, but I do know one thing: The <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> and the government have outsourced their foreign policy to the progressive left. It has resulted in Canada, following a motion that was just passed in the House, supporting the stopping of arms sales to Israel, while they are, out of the other side of their mouths, telling the Israelis that Canada stands with them. They cannot walk and chew gum at the same time; at least the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">foreign minister</a> cannot.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8324530" data-originallang="en">It is unfortunate to see that a long-standing consensus of support for a democratic friend and ally has been left to languish on the floor of the House of Commons by the Liberals. There will be a time when we return to that long-standing consensus in this country, and that time cannot come soon enough.</p>
