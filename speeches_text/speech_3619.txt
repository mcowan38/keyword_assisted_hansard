<p data-HoCid="8276173" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, history is clear. There is no such thing as a military solution. There are only political solutions. Nowhere is that clearer than what we are seeing right now in Israel and Palestine.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8276174" data-originallang="en">This is what I want to understand: Conservatives today are going to vote against a motion that states that the House recognize a Palestinian state, like 139 countries have already done. Let us be clear. Are Conservatives saying they no longer support a two-state solution? Are the Conservatives today saying that they do not support statehood for the Palestinian people? </p>
<p data-HoCid="8276175" data-originallang="en">That is what they are saying by voting against this motion.</p>
