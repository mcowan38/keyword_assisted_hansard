<p data-HoCid="8703008" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703009" data-originallang="en">I want to thank all of the witnesses today. Your presence here shows us both the breadth of opinion and the diversity of the Jewish community in Canada and the importance to you of both Canada and Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703010" data-originallang="en">I want to start by saying very clearly that I unequivocally support the State of Israel, the defence of Israel, the people of Israel and their right to have peace and prosperity. That doesn't mean I necessarily unconditionally support the Government of Israel, nor would I ever support any government unless it protects its own citizens, the rule of law and the international rules-based order.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703011" data-originallang="en">I would say the same for the State of Palestine, recognized by 146 countries but not yet Canada. I will unequivocally support a state of Palestine. That doesn't mean that I necessarily support its government at the current time, but I separate those issues, as I do in Canada. I don't always support the governments in Canada either. There have been several I haven't supported, but it doesn't mean that I'm not loyal to Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703012" data-originallang="en">What I want to be very clear about, however, is that the question we are dealing with at this committee is Canada's recognition of the State of Palestine. The question is not if we will or whether we will or not; we will. Canada will. I am convinced of that, so the question is about when we do it. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8703013" data-originallang="en">We have talked about a negotiated recognition. I'm not a student of history, but I don't believe that recognition of states is always negotiated. Canada will unilaterally, as we have always done, recognize states. We did that with Kosovo and we've done it with a number of places.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703014" data-originallang="en">What are the pluses and minuses of recognition of the State of Palestine for Canada and for Jews in Canada? How will it help?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703015" data-originallang="en">I want to begin with Ms. Kowalski.</p>
