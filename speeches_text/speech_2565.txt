<p data-HoCid="7937314" data-originallang="en">Our field research and our connections with civil society on the ground in Sri Lanka have shown that since the sanctions were placed in January, the culture of impunity has not changed in Sri Lanka. As I mentioned, as recently as last week there was a memorialization event of an individual who died in a hunger strike 36 years ago. That memorial event was attacked with rocks. The actual member of Parliament in Sri Lanka was also attacked. The police and army officials were just standing around watching. There's continuous land grabbing that's happening. Traditional Tamil homeland and Hindu temples are being erased with Buddhist temples. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7937315" data-originallang="en">This is a structural genocide that's continuing to occur. It hasn't helped the situation, and it's continuing to grow. There is concern from civil society on the ground that this could continue to escalate further.</p>
