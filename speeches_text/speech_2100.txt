<p data-HoCid="7566643" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I am glad to speak this afternoon. I will be sharing my time with the member for <a data-HoCid="278694" href="/politicians/leah-taylor-roy/" title="Leah Taylor Roy">Aurora—Oak Ridges—Richmond Hill</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7566644" data-originallang="en">Let me acknowledge at the outset that we are gathered here on the traditional unceded lands of the Algonquin people.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7566645" data-originallang="en">Before I go into the speech, I have some important reflections on the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It is a document that has entrenched into Canadian law such fundamental rights and freedoms as I think people around the world aspire to achieve. Over the years, this has been a guiding document in my life. I think it has been a guiding document for many in this country. While it is not perfect, it has offered a very important path towards the recognition of international human rights and the universality of human rights. Of course, we can date this back to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that was signed right at the end of World War II, as well as the former Canadian Bill of Rights and other international covenants and documents Canada is party to.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7566646" data-originallang="en">On a personal level, my family came to Canada 40 years ago this year. We fled an armed conflict in Sri Lanka where the rights of minorities were suppressed, and suppressed at will, oftentimes with reinforcement by law. Around this House, this country and my riding, millions of Canadians can trace their history to difficulties because governments chose to suppress their rights because of who they are.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7566647" data-originallang="en">In fact, in Canada we can see a number of occasions of this. The member for <a data-HoCid="278615" href="/politicians/randall-garrison/" title="Randall Garrison">Esquimalt—Saanich—Sooke</a> talked about the experience of the LGBTQI community, and of course the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> has often spoken about the disparity between indigenous and non-indigenous Canadians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7566648" data-originallang="en">The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms has set a benchmark for us to follow in many ways. While it is important that we were able to get this agreement in 1982 with the provinces with the inclusion of the notwithstanding clause, this clause was always meant to be used sparingly by governments.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7566649" data-originallang="fr">Our charter is also a source of inspiration for the many countries that have built some of their constitutional documents in a similar way. In short, as a Canadian, I am proud that 40 years ago we decided, as a society, to have such an instrument.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7566650" data-originallang="en">Section 33 of the charter, which is commonly known as the notwithstanding clause, made it possible to reach a political compromise between the different entities making up Canada when the charter was adopted. This section authorizes Parliament or the legislature of a province to derogate from certain provisions of the charter, namely those protecting fundamental freedoms, legal guarantees and equality rights.</p>
