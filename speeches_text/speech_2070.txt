<p data-HoCid="7546503" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I want to start by saying I agree with and appreciate the <a data-HoCid="278909" href="/politicians/karina-gould/" title="Karina Gould">minister</a> for bringing forward this legislation so early in this session, as well as how important this legislation is. I also appreciate her comments about the importance of investing in the workforce. As we have heard from our colleague from <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>, this is an ongoing concern. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7546504" data-originallang="en">I will speak to the specifics in Ontario. The estimates are that we will need an additional 14,700 early childhood educators in Ontario by 2025-26. In the current agreement that the federal government signed with the Province of Ontario, the wage floor is $18 an hour, rising by one dollar per year until 2025. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7546505" data-originallang="en">Recognizing the talented folks in this workforce and the need to not only retain but also to recruit at these numbers, and since it is not just the Province of Ontario but also the federal government that has a responsibility, can the minister comment on what more needs to be done to ensure we are investing in the workforce and getting wages lifted higher?</p>
