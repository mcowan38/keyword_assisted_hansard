<p data-HoCid="8435232" data-originallang="en"> Sure, I can speak about that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435233" data-originallang="en">I think we have an issue right now, and in fact, we have submitted a grant request to SSHRC, actually, to look at this issue of the way that the equity, diversity and inclusion frameworks that are on our campuses are not speaking to Jewish people, are not speaking to anti-Semitism, and in fact in some cases are using an ideological framework that divides the world into black or white, victimized or victimizer, and oppressed or oppressor. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8435234" data-originallang="en">What happens is that Jews get shoehorned into this framework inappropriately. It's an inappropriate application.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435235" data-originallang="en">I would say that we need to strengthen these EDI frameworks and make sure that there's an inclusion of the Jewish experience, and also of anti-Semitism, in a way that actually will protect and recognize the Jewish experience.</p>
