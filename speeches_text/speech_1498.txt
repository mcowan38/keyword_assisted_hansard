<p data-HoCid="6967540" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, it is this <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> and this government that have been prepared to take a hard and uncomfortable look at the history of racism and exclusion in this country. Be it the firm commitment to the path of reconciliation with first nations, the apology to the Italian community for the internment of its members in World War II, or the apology to the Jewish community and to the passengers of the <em>St. Louis</em>, we must remind all Canadians that when we divide and when we say “none is too many”, the consequences are tragic.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6967541" data-originallang="en">These are our uncomfortable truths. I would invite the member and his colleagues to get uncomfortable and do the work, the collective and judicious work, of recognizing that conveniently dismissing a few bad apples or ignoring the disturbing white supremacy and racism that was in front of all Canadians and at the root of the leadership of these illegal blockades, are something that needs to be addressed and explained to all Canadians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6967542" data-originallang="en">One Nazi flag, one Confederate flag and one gun is too many.</p>
