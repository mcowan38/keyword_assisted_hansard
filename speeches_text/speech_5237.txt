<p data-HoCid="8679243" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679244" data-originallang="en">Thank you for that comment, Ambassador Allen. I think that's an important thing to note. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679245" data-originallang="en">I'd also like you to comment, if you could, on yesterday's decision to ban UNRWA and list the United Nations agency as a terrorist organization. Can you talk about the impacts this will have on the conversation about two states and Palestinian human rights?</p>
