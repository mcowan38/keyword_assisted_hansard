<p data-HoCid="6554209" data-originallang="en">I'm looking at an article that was published in The Lancet by a group of researchers from the University of Nottingham at the end of February. It's regarding your vaccine, particularly decisions related to extended dosing. This article argues that the clinical data, as well as real-life observational data based on evidence from Israel, did not support delaying the second dose of your vaccine past the recommended three-week interval.</p>
