<p data-HoCid="6644462" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, April 24 is Armenian genocide remembrance day, a time to remember and reflect on the horrible crime that led to the deaths of over one million ethnic Armenians during World War I.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6644463" data-originallang="en">During the month of April, we remember all genocides: the Holocaust, the Rwandan genocide, the Cambodian genocide and far too many others. Governments and people around the word must recognize genocides for the permanent marks of hate they leave on our history. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6644464" data-originallang="en">Tomorrow, I invite all Canadians to join in remembering with our large Armenian Canadian community through online ceremonies. Genocide must never be ignored or denied.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6644465" data-originallang="en"> As we honour those lost in the Armenian genocide, remember and proclaim “Never again”.</p>
