<p data-HoCid="8435189" data-originallang="en"> I think we just need to point something out that's really important, which is based on actual data about what we know about Jewish Canadians. This is from Robert Brym's study that just came out last month, which tells us that 91% of Canadian Jews would say that they support the State of Israel and the existence of the State of Israel as a Jewish state. We know that when people are attacking people for their core identity, which is their connection with Israel, they are attacking the Jewish community.</p>
