<p data-HoCid="6766029" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6766030" data-originallang="fr">Ladies and gentlemen members of the House, good afternoon.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6766031" data-originallang="fr">I am extremely pleased to appear before you today to represent Quebec pork producers and to speak to you about the issues related to the bill, which should be passed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6766032" data-originallang="fr">Our organization represents more than 1,700 producers, who market seven million processed hogs in Quebec per year. Quebec is the largest pork producing province, and our sector is the second largest agri-food sector in Quebec. Hog production in Quebec contributes $1.13 billion annually to GDP and generates $1.8 billion in farm gate sales. Hog farms employ some 14,000 people, and more than 30,000 families make their living from the Quebec pork industry. Quebec farmers are proud to meet 80% of the local demand for fresh meat, with Quebec's self-sufficiency rate for pork at around 400%. By comparison, the self-sufficiency rate for blueberries is about 300%, for cranberries it is 490%, and for maple syrup 1300%.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6766033" data-originallang="fr">We are therefore very proud to export most of our production to other countries, mainly to countries where natural resources cannot allow for sustainable farming like ours in Quebec. Between 2009 and 2020, the value of Quebec's pork exports rose from $975 million to $2.1 billion. This is an impressive average annual growth rate of 7.25%.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6766034" data-originallang="fr">This is in keeping with the Zero Hunger Challenge and the Responsible Consumption and Production goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda, to which Canada has signed on. All of this is to tell you that the pork industry and other agricultural industries in Canada are extremely important and must be protected by legislation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6766035" data-originallang="fr">Of course, hog producers face many risks, as we heard earlier, risks involving diseases that must be avoided at all costs. I don't know if any of you have ever visited a hog farm, but in most cases, not just anyone can enter. Before entering, you have to sign a register. You must change your boots and clothes, shower, keep to a sanitary area and respect the biosecurity rules, as well as animal welfare inside the farm. These rules are important. It took several years to put them in place with the different stakeholders who supported us in this regard.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6766036" data-originallang="fr">So the biosecurity rules are very much present and very much followed. It's mainly about the health of the animals. On the farm, the pigs' environment is calm and stress-free. Welfare standards even recommend toys and music for the animals.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6766037" data-originallang="fr">When a group of agitated people rush inside our farms, the animal is definitely experiencing stress. This does not just apply to pigs. It's the same for rabbits and other animals, which can even die instantly when people who ignore these rules enter these farms. So the consequences of breaking and entering are many. The stress on the producers is also enormous, as we saw recently on a farm. I personally know the family that operates that farm, a young family that just got into pork production in 2019.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6766038" data-originallang="fr">However, the law doesn't see it that way, not in Quebec nor in other provinces. If you look at the laws in Quebec and in some Canadian provinces, you don't find anything that deals specifically with livestock. We have to try to defend ourselves with general laws in the Criminal Code or the Civil Code, and that is extremely difficult and costly for us.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6766039" data-originallang="fr">This bill sends a clear message, from coast to coast: you don't go onto a farm without permission, period. It's not a matter of whether the farmer has put up a sign, put up a gate, or locked his doors. You don't have the right to enter a farm, it doesn't happen without permission.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6766040" data-originallang="fr">This bill is essential and is in line with the demands made by hog farmers in Quebec and Canada, and by my colleagues in all other agricultural sectors over the years.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6766041" data-originallang="fr">We also need to think about the threat posed by African swine fever. This is a disease that has decimated half of China's livestock industry in recent years. In Quebec, it would be devastating, as it would be throughout Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6766042" data-originallang="fr">It was mostly international travellers who contaminated farms in the rest of the world, whether in Germany, Belgium or elsewhere.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6766043" data-originallang="fr">We need to be extremely careful. A single case detected in Canada would jeopardize the survival of Canada's 7,000 pork producers. Quebec and Canada would lose an important economic sector, and achieving various objectives would become very difficult.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6766044" data-originallang="fr">This disease is just one example of why unauthorized entries into a farm should be regulated in the manner proposed by Bill <a data-HoCid="10866025" href="/bills/43-2/C-205/" title="An Act to amend the Health of Animals Act">C-205</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6766045" data-originallang="fr">This legislative proposal is essential to the survival of a strong and economically important agricultural sector.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6766046" data-originallang="fr">Thank you for your attention.</p>
