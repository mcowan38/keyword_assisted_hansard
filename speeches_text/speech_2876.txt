<p data-HoCid="7994061" data-originallang="en">The point I was making before Mr. Julian raised his point of order was that the reason this subamendment is so important is that it would be irresponsible for us as a committee to hear from Mr. Achi and the CBC ombudsman but not hear from the CBC's CEO or executive. It is incumbent upon us, and I believe it is very important, to hear from Ms. Tait, as the head of the organization and therefore the individual who is responsible for answering for its decisions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7994062" data-originallang="en">Again, I would draw attention to the fact that this subamendment, to answer my own question, has to do with Ms. Tait's coming in regard to the CBC's coverage of the conflict in Gaza. That is the purpose of this subamendment. It is not to be confused with Ms. Tait's general mandate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7994063" data-originallang="en">With thatâ€”</p>
