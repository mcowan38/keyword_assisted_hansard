<p data-HoCid="8220262" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8220263" data-originallang="en">I thank Ms. Kwan and Salma Zahid for this very important motion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8220264" data-originallang="en">I might have an amendment to the motion. I'd like to see if we can circulate it in writing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8220265" data-originallang="en">The situation in Gaza is devastating. I met with one of my constituents a couple of weeks ago, who has about eight family members with numbers, but they're still waiting. They don't know what's going to happen. I was with Ms. Salma Zahid in a town hall, and one Canadian who came said his son was stuck there. There are so many stories, and we need to ask questions about the cap and why Canadians are not able to get out of there.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8220266" data-originallang="en">In my opinion, even three hours is not enough, but if we can circulate the motion as amended, I might be able to bring forward an amendment to it.</p>
