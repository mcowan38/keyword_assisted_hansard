<p data-HoCid="7447151" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7447152" data-originallang="en">Can the clerk...? Again, we're going to get into a bit of a rabbit hole here if we debate this too much, and we do have witnesses for a few more minutes here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7447153" data-originallang="en">I'm wondering if the clerk might be able to share where we're at with this study and the number of meetings we have left. I know we had some discussions about the number of meetings and what kind of timeline we have and when we would potentially fit this in. I know we're losing a meeting on Thursday, so I'm wondering what could be in the realm of possibility for this.</p>
