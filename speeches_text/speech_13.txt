<p data-HoCid="6042155" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, as I was just saying, going back to Bill <a data-HoCid="10613928" href="/bills/43-1/C-3/" title="An Act to amend the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act and the Canada Border Services Agency Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts">C-3</a> and the oversight propositions in the bill, and back to the Yiddish proverb, “for example” is not proof that this legislation needs to be before us at this very moment. It could have been cobbled and combined with other matters that the Government of Canada considered needed to be done to the Canada Border Services Agency.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6042156" data-originallang="en">Again, we have seen a predilection of the government to institute and include all types of things in omnibus budget bills that do not belong there. I should remind the House that in the last Parliament, the Speaker decided to exclude certain portions of previous omnibus budget bills.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6042157" data-originallang="en">When I talk to my constituents, when I ask them what is critical to their day to day, what are the most important issues to them and what touches their daily life, none of them have told me it is Bill <a data-HoCid="10613928" href="/bills/43-1/C-3/" title="An Act to amend the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act and the Canada Border Services Agency Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts">C-3</a>. None of them have told me it is the oversight of the CBSA. It is their jobs, their livelihoods and the prosperity of Alberta families.</p>
