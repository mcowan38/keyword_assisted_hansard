<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, I look forward to that clarification and I hope the Canadian government will follow suit and also declare the UAWC a terrorist organization.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">I want to ask about UNRWA. Canada gives tens of millions of dollars to UNRWA. In January, IMPACT-se issued a report confirming that UNRWA was providing anti-Semitic school materials to young Palestinian students. The minister said at the time that she asked her officials to investigate how this happened.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">What was the outcome of this investigation, and will a report be tabled?</p>
