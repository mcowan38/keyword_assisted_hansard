<p data-HoCid="7654080" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I am rising on a point of order this morning respecting the government's Motion No. 2 concerning the Senate amendments to Bill <a data-HoCid="11528728" href="/bills/44-1/C-11/" title="An Act to amend the Broadcasting Act and to make related and consequential amendments to other Acts">C-11</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7654081" data-originallang="en">In my view, the notice of motion engages the rule of anticipation and cannot be proposed to the House later today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7654082" data-originallang="en">Normally such a point of order should be raised when the motion is actually proposed to the House, but given that it is listed on the Projected Order of Business for consideration in an hour's time, the complexity of the issues involved and as a courtesy to you to find some time to prepare a ruling, Mr. Speaker, I wanted to rise as soon as the House opened this morning.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7654083" data-originallang="en">On March 8 and March 9, the House considered a government motion concerning the Senate's amendments, a motion which is now referred to as Motion No. 1 on the Notice Paper, to which my colleague, the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278459" href="/politicians/rachael-harder/" title="Rachael Thomas">Lethbridge</a>, has moved an amendment.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7654084" data-originallang="en">Flash forward to Friday evening, when today's Notice Paper was published, we see this new motion, Motion No. 2, from the Liberal government. They are both very long motions, so I will spare the Speaker and the House from hearing them each read out loud. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7654085" data-originallang="en">Suffice it to say, I studied them very closely to see what might be different between them. Lo and behold, the English versions of the motions are absolutely identical. When one refers to the French versions, one spots the difference, which is a single instance of a “1” and a “2”, in Roman numerals, being transposed. That is it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7654086" data-originallang="en">Let me explain for the House briefly what that means. The Liberal government made a drafting mistake; it got its motion wrong. Now it wants a do-over. If one is a golfer, one might call it a mulligan. All this is on a policy Liberals are mistakenly pursuing on a bill they keep botching and on amendments they keep flubbing, and now a motion they cannot even get right, and those people want to control the Internet.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7654087" data-originallang="en">Setting that aside, I will get back to the procedural concern. The substantive effect of these two motions is identical. Indeed, the text in one official language is identical. The words used in the other official language are all the same. It is just two numbers that are transposed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7654088" data-originallang="en">Having established these motions are, for all intents and purposes, identical, let me refer to page 568 of <em>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</em>, which explains the rule of anticipation. It reads:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7654089" data-originallang="en"> According to this rule, which applied to other proceedings as well as to motions, a motion could not anticipate a matter which was standing on the <em>Order Paper</em> for further discussion, whether as a bill or a motion, and which was contained in a more effective form of proceeding (for example, a bill or any other Order of the Day is more effective than a motion, which in turn has priority over an amendment, which in turn is more effective than a written or oral question). If such a motion were allowed, it could indeed forestall or block a decision from being taken on the matter already on the <em>Order Paper</em>. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7654090" data-originallang="en">It goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7654091" data-originallang="en"> The rule is dependent on the principle which forbids the same question from being decided twice within the same session. It does not apply, however, to similar or identical motions or bills which appear on the <em>Notice Paper</em> prior to debate. The rule of anticipation becomes operative only when one of two similar motions on the <em>Order Paper</em> is actually proceeded with. For example, two bills similar in substance will be allowed to stand on the <em>Order Paper</em> but only one may be moved and disposed of. If the first bill is withdrawn (by unanimous consent, often after debate has started), the second may be proceeded with.... A point of order regarding anticipation may be raised when the second motion is proposed from the Chair, if the first has already been proposed to the House and has become an Order of the Day. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7654092" data-originallang="en">Though the government House leader might argue that questions about this rule do not come up often, there are a series of precedents through the years that are relevant to the issue before the Chair today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7654093" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker Michener, on March 13, 1959, at page 238 of the Journals, held, in relation to the rule of anticipation concerning nearly identical pieces of legislation:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7654094" data-originallang="en"> ...I first considered whether the motion should be accepted to stand on the Order Paper at the same time. I am satisfied that this was quite in order, but I came to the conclusion that it would be quite improper to permit a second debate on identically the same subject matter as the subject matter of a debate which was already proceeding. In other words, the House is not going to occupy itself on two separate occasions under two separate headings with exactly the same business. That would not be reasonable, and I can find no support or authority for following such a course. Thus I have come to the conclusion that this bill must stand, as well as the other bill in the same terms, or at least in terms for exactly the same purpose, until the bill which was first moved has been disposed of either by being withdrawn, which would open the door for one of these other bills to proceed, or by way of being approved, which would automatically dispose of these bills because the House would not vote twice on the same subject matter any more than it would debate the same subject matter twice. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7654095" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker Lamoureux, on July 7, 1969, said, in a ruling found at page 1317 of the Journals, concerning a government motion to amend the Standing Orders, anticipating a motion to concur in a report of the former standing committee on procedure and organization:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7654096" data-originallang="en"> I might say, having taken into account the arguments advanced by members of the opposition, that if the honourable Member for Grenville-Carleton had moved his [concurrence] motion I would have recognized that the rule of anticipation would have given his motion precedence...to the motion that is now before the House in the name of the President of the Privy Council. I would have so ruled... </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7654097" data-originallang="en">A much more recent predecessor of yours, Mr. Speaker, considered the matter of two committee instruction motions that varied by a difference of just five words. The Chair ruled, on June 11, 2014, at page 6649 of the Debates:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7654098" data-originallang="en"> Upon examination of the section of O'Brien and Bosc, upon which both House leaders have relied extensively for their arguments, it seems to the Chair that the key concept is the question of whether or not the motions are substantially the same. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7654099" data-originallang="en"> Upon examination of both motions on the notice paper, it does seem that the motions are substantially the same and that the principles cited by the government House leader as to the practice of the House are persuasive to the Chair. Accordingly, we will not be proceeding with the motion at this time. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7654100" data-originallang="en">The rule of anticipation is a concept which is not unheard of in the current Parliament, or to you, Mr. Speaker, for that matter.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7654101" data-originallang="en">On May 11, 2022, the Deputy Speaker, at page 5123 of the Debates, ruled that Bill <a data-HoCid="11535416" href="/bills/44-1/C-250/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (prohibition — promotion of antisemitism)">C-250</a>, the private member's bill proposed by my colleague, the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278477" href="/politicians/kevin-waugh/" title="Kevin Waugh">Saskatoon—Grasswood</a>, could not be debated and would be rendered pending, following the second reading of Bill <a data-HoCid="11719486" href="/bills/44-1/C-19/" title="An Act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on April 7, 2022 and other measures">C-19</a>, a budget implementation bill that contained clauses similar to my friend's bill, because:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7654102" data-originallang="en"> The House should not face a situation where the same question can be cited twice within the same session, unless the House's intention is to rescind or revoke the decision. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7654103" data-originallang="en">After Bill <a data-HoCid="11719486" href="/bills/44-1/C-19/" title="An Act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on April 7, 2022 and other measures">C-19</a> had received royal assent, you made a further ruling, Mr. Speaker, on September 20, 2022, at page 7341 of the Debates, to discharge Bill <a data-HoCid="11535416" href="/bills/44-1/C-250/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (prohibition — promotion of antisemitism)">C-250</a>. In doing so, you said:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7654104" data-originallang="en"> ...there is a long-standing principle to keep or avoid having the same question from being decided twice within the same session </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7654105" data-originallang="en">A similar case can be found in your June 6, 2021 ruling, at page 6142 of the Debates, whereby Bill <a data-HoCid="11541330" href="/bills/44-1/C-243/" title="An Act respecting the elimination of the use of forced labour and child labour in supply chains">C-243</a>, sponsored by the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278656" href="/politicians/marcus-powlowski/" title="Marcus Powlowski">Thunder Bay—Rainy River</a>, could not be proceeded with following the second reading of a Senate public bill, Bill <a data-HoCid="11474494" href="/bills/44-1/S-211/" title="An Act to enact the Fighting Against Forced Labour and Child Labour in Supply Chains Act and to amend the Customs Tariff">S-211</a>. Bill C-243 has been listed on the Order Paper every sitting day since, under the heading “Pending Business”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7654106" data-originallang="en">To recap the current case, the government's Motion No. 1 concerning the Senate amendments to Bill <a data-HoCid="11528728" href="/bills/44-1/C-11/" title="An Act to amend the Broadcasting Act and to make related and consequential amendments to other Acts">C-11</a> was moved, as I mentioned, on March 8, and then became an Order of the Day. Therefore, Motion No. 2 may only be proceeded with if Motion No.1 has been withdrawn, as the various authorities would observe. Otherwise, proceeding with Motion No. 2 would offend the rule of anticipation and cannot be proposed to the House, as forecasted, at noon today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7654107" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker Casgrain's ruling on February 24, 1936, at pages 67 and 68 of the Journals, explains a possible way forward for the government concerning its Motion No. 1: </p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7654108" data-originallang="en"> The adjournment of the debate, last Thursday on the second reading of Bill No. 2...meant that the question shall again be considered at a future sitting when the order for Public Bills will be reached. This is what is called, in parliamentary procedure, appointing a matter for consideration by the House. [Erskine] May...gives many precedents showing that the discussion of an appointed matter cannot be anticipated by a motion...There is sufficient similarity in the Bill and the Motion to confine them to one debate...The difference in details between the two propositions may be dealt with by moving amendments... but it is not sufficient to justify a duplication of the debate. It is a well known principle that the same question cannot be raised twice in the same session. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7654109" data-originallang="en">The difference between the government's Motion No.1 and Motion No. 2 could be addressed by an amendment to Motion No. 1. It is that simple, really.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7654110" data-originallang="en">All the Liberal government needs to do is allow the debate to continue on the amendment moved by the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278459" href="/politicians/rachael-harder/" title="Rachael Thomas">Lethbridge</a>. Once that debate has eventually concluded and the vote taken, the government could, in the event that my colleague's thoughtful amendment is not adopted by the House, of course, once debate resumes on the main motion, move its own amendment to achieve the change Motion No. 2 contains, which would be up to the House to discuss and decide.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7654111" data-originallang="en">If you were to find my point of order to be well taken, Mr. Speaker, it would not be the first major procedural error the government has made in pursuing its flawed policy to control the Internet. On June 15, 2021, you ruled out of order many committee amendments made to Bill <a data-HoCid="11528728" href="/bills/44-1/C-11/" title="An Act to amend the Broadcasting Act and to make related and consequential amendments to other Acts">C-11</a>'s predecessor in the previous Parliament because the Liberals on the Canadian heritage committee had run roughshod over the rules and broke several of them in trying to rush the bill through Parliament before the opportunistic and unnecessary early election the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> called that August.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7654112" data-originallang="en">Now it seems that the Liberals are equally hasty in ramming their Internet control bill through the House once again. It is almost as if the government is in a rush to clear the decks for something to come.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7654113" data-originallang="en">I hope you will find in favour of my point of order, Mr. Speaker, and I look forward to your response.</p>
