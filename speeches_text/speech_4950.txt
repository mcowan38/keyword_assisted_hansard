<p data-HoCid="8604040" data-originallang="en">Yes, but in terms of the UAE, we know the evidence is a lot more solid, and it's supporting a side that is committing mass killing, massacring non-Arab groups and committing mass rape and sexual and gender-based violence against members of these communities based on their identity. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8604041" data-originallang="en">The House can also pass a motion outlining and calling for ceasing the transfer of arms per this legislation, in the same way that the House passed motion No. 658, ending the arms exports to Israel and Hamas. I understand that's not binding, but at least that is something that might get the ball rolling on this initiative to end arms transfers to the UAE until they end their support for the RSF.</p>
