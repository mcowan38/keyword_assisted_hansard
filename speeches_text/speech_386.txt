<p data-HoCid="6326715" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Clerk, I have two questions. As Ms. Kwan substituted in for Ms. Gazan, does she therefore have the right to do this? That's my first question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6326716" data-originallang="en">If her motion is in order, then I seek your advice on how we procedurally work through it.</p>
