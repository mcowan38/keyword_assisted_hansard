<p data-HoCid="7035010" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I often enjoy the remarks from the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278408" href="/politicians/michael-chong/" title="Michael Chong">Wellingtonâ€”Halton Hills</a>. I do not always agree with him, but I appreciate his perspective.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7035011" data-originallang="en">What I heard from his remarks moments ago was the notion of not compartmentalizing our compassion, the notion that we have an immigration system that is wholly unprepared for the scale and the scope of the atrocities that are being committed around the world, in particular in Ukraine. He referenced Afghanistan, but of course atrocities are also happening in Syria, Palestine, Yemen and all around the world, not just as wars being fought but also from a climate disaster perspective. I would argue that prior to this war in Ukraine, our immigration system was vastly outdated and completely inadequate to meet global needs.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7035012" data-originallang="en"> Through you, Madam Speaker, to the hon. member, given what is before us today, what lessons can we learn and what systems can we improve to ensure that our immigration system is prepared not just for what is happening in Ukraine but for the atrocities that are happening around the world?</p>
