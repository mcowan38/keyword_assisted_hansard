<p data-HoCid="8396730" data-originallang="en">As you noted, the previous Middle East strategy, which had been in place since 2016, was built very much on a different problem set and a different platform.

At that point, when we see what the situation is, whether it be the political situation on the ground, the humanitarian assistance situation on the ground, the development needs of the region or, finally, as you have noted in previous questions, the reconstruction needs in Gaza, it will require the Government of Canada, obviously, to reflect on and review our current footprint in the region.
