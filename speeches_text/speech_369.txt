<p data-HoCid="6390656" data-originallang="en">General Fortin, you were the commanding officer for Operation Impact, and I believe you were the general in command at the time of the COVID restrictions coming into play and the drawdown of forces there. Can you speak to how that played out on the ground in Kuwait and Iraq, as well as Lebanon and Palestine, with our forces in those locations?</p>
