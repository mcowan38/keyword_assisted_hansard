<p data-HoCid="7002287" data-originallang="en"> That is absolutely the case. There was a law professor from McGill who had written on this phenomenon, where certain individuals were chosen, not despite their prejudicial statements and their bias but precisely because of it. He was referring to someone who was appointed at the time of the Goldstone report, but sadly this is becoming systematic.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002288" data-originallang="en">At the Human Rights Council, the most significant mechanism to target Israel is the commission of inquiry that was created in May, which was put forward by Pakistan and the Palestinian delegation. The person who was appointed was Navi Pillay, who is a former UN rights chief but also someone who in the past two years has actively lobbied governments to “sanction Israeli apartheid”. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7002289" data-originallang="en">She signed this statement in 2020 to lobby governments. She signed another manifesto in June 2021 that condemned Israel for committing crimes during the last war. She, absurdly, has been appointed to head an inquiry into whether Israel is racist and whether it committed crimes, when she's already lobbied governments on precisely that point. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7002290" data-originallang="en">I used to be an attorney, and if you go before a judge and ask that judge to recuse himself or herself, you would immediately achieve that result. We submitted a 30-page recusal request. We hope that Navi Pillay will recuse herself. We also hope that all other civil society groups that are committed to the principles of impartiality, that oblige commissioners to have that impartiality, will speak out in this regard.</p>
