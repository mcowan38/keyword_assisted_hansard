<p data-HoCid="6949184" data-originallang="en">I want to just explain to the committee why I think this study is important. First of all, all of us, on all sides in the House, condemn these symbols. This is not a partisan study or partisan issue. It's one where I believe we need to educate Canadians on what these symbols actually mean.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6949185" data-originallang="en">Over the last little while, my office has received numbers of emails from people arguing that the swastika and the Confederate flag are not hate symbols. What we need to have, I believe, is a historian come in and explain in front of us and to Canadians what these symbols have historically meant. Then I'd like to also suggest that organizations representing the Black community and the Jewish community be invited to also give their take on the meaning of these symbols and how they harm the community.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6949186" data-originallang="en">This is not the long study that will be done when the great legislation that Mr. Julian is proposing comes before the House. Then there'll be a lot of discussion about whether freedom of expression in section 2 is breached and whether section 1 saves it. I'm looking at this as being an, as we say in French, <em>étude préalable</em>, a small study to just basically educate and inform Canadians in a non-partisan way what these symbols mean. It will then set it up for the House to have a larger debate on what actions it can take, including legislation, to potentially deal with the symbols of hate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6949187" data-originallang="en">I want to assure everybody, again—because there have been a lot of people making comments—that this is not related to the convoy. This is not related to allegations that any member of any party supports these horrible symbols. It's something that I'm hoping we all across party lines can work together on to determine the best way of handling this and educating Canadians through just one meeting on this issue.</p>
