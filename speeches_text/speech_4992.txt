<p data-HoCid="8639887" data-originallang="en"> I'll bring the meeting back to order. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8639888" data-originallang="en">If I could have everyone's attention, including the official opposition's, first I'm going to highlight the safety aspect. When everyone is talking at once, it is putting the interpreters in a very difficult position. We've made many changes here to ensure their health is protected.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8639889" data-originallang="en">I also want to highlight that Mr. Bains is here for about an hour, because of a conflict, which I understand, and I appreciate his being here. He has agreed to come back. If we continue to go down this rabbit hole and these debates that are happening while it's a member's turn to speak, and when those items will be brought up by an opposing side in a later round, we're not going to get anywhere, and we'll be back.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8639890" data-originallang="en">Now, further, I had committed not to sit next week, but if this devolves the way it is going to devolve, I might reconsider that. </p>
