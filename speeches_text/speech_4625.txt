<p data-HoCid="8517790" data-originallang="fr"> I think I understand the reasoning behind his assertion, which is highly conjectural. He believes that, today, in the context of the war in Gaza and the situation there, including the IRGC on that list would de facto place us in the camp of pro-Israeli countries, which could damage our credibility in the eyes of a certain segment of international public opinion. I imagine that that is what led him to make that assertion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8517791" data-originallang="fr">My answer is that there's no good time to put an organization, which is indeed comparable to a fascist organization, on such a list. It's true that there might be a price to pay in diplomatic terms and in terms of our international image.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8517792" data-originallang="fr">However, it's time for Canada to stop playing it safe, being risk avoidant and cautious. There comes a time when courageous action is needed.</p>
