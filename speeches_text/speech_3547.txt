<p data-HoCid="8265398" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Thank you to the minister and the officials for coming back to the committee again.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8265399" data-originallang="en">I must first begin by saying that while I appreciate the minister coming—I really do, since this is a motion I moved—I am disappointed. I need to put this on the record: The motion calling for the minister to come and speak about Gaza and Sudan is, in my mind, perhaps the most urgent situation. I had hoped the minister would come and speak to the committee on that issue first. That is not the case. I understand the minister will be returning in March to deal with this issue. Today we're dealing with international students. However, because of the urgency of the situation in Gaza, I had hoped to get some questions to the minister and officials with respect to that situation. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8265400" data-originallang="en">That said, regarding international students, I also have to put this on the record: Minister, when you made the announcement on the cap—this is in the backdrop of the media and others saying newcomers are to blame for the housing crisis—I think it did a disservice to international students in the way this announcement was cast in that context. I don't think that is the right message. I hope that is not your intention, but that is how it is perceived: that somehow newcomers—in this instance, international students—are to blame for the housing crisis.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8265401" data-originallang="en">I can talk all day long about where the housing crisis came from, which is, of course, 30 years of successive Liberal and Conservative governments relying on the private sector to deliver the housing Canadians need and can afford. That's a conversation for another day.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8265402" data-originallang="en">I want to touch on international students, in particular unintended consequences. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8265403" data-originallang="en">In the announcement that came about with the cap—which I do not agree with—was the notion that applicants need to demonstrate financial resources of $20,000 per year. That's a shift. There are unintended consequences, because there are students who come in on a scholarship, for example. The way this is calculated or dealt with means they may not be able to meet this new requirement now. Many of those who come on a scholarship obviously may well have some financial constraints. Those scholarships enable them to come and enhance their education and have those opportunities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8265404" data-originallang="en">In fact, my colleague <a data-HoCid="278615" href="/politicians/randall-garrison/" title="Randall Garrison">Randall Garrison, the member for Esquimalt—Saanich—Sooke</a>, wrote to the minister about Pearson College with respect to scholarships for students. He has not received a response yet from the minister on this letter. That was dated January 17, 2024. It asked whether or not IRCC officials would consider the total value of the scholarship, room and board provided by Pearson College to the students as a consideration towards that $25,000 requirement.</p>
