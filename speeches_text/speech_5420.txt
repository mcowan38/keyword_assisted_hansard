<p data-HoCid="8703083" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Chair, and thank you, colleagues.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703084" data-originallang="en">We had multiple academics at the committee last week who shared, from their perspectives, that there's no pathway to a two-state solution unless we recognize that there are two states. Today I heard that from Ms. Kowalski, and I heard from you, Mr. Fogel and Mr. Topas, some conditions you suggest Canada should apply before recognizing two states.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703085" data-originallang="en">My question to you, Mr. Fogel, is this: You mentioned democracy, so should we no longer recognize other states if they're not democratic enough? For example, is Eritrea not a state? </p>
<p data-HoCid="8703086" data-originallang="en">I will ask the same question of Mr. Topas as well, who put forward that we must first establish structures for effective governance before we recognize the Palestinian state.</p>
