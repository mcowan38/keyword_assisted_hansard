<p data-HoCid="7571886" data-originallang="fr">We are used to talking about diplomacy of a more political or cultural nature, but science knows no borders. We work in teams all over the world. For example, the Palestinians worked alongside the Israelis on CERN's particle accelerator in Geneva. So science diplomacy consists of using science and researchers to open doors all over the world, the francophone world in this case. Science diplomacy is now part of the vocabulary of my authorities in Quebec, and I am very proud of that.</p>
