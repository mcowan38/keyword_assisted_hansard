<p data-HoCid="8289995" data-originallang="en"> Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8289996" data-originallang="en">I remember your testimony back in 2019 at justice committee. At the time, we had been doing Bill <a data-HoCid="9710291" href="/bills/42-1/C-71/" title="An Act to amend certain Acts and Regulations in relation to firearms">C-71</a> at the public safety committee. As someone who's advocated quite vocally for gun control, I became the target, and have been for a number of years, of the gun lobby, which has included threats, memes and all kinds of things on what I think you called “the vomitorium of social media”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8289997" data-originallang="en">I still remember that testimony, and thinking how accurate it was. Since that time it's only gotten worse—quite a bit worse, actually. Recently Mr. Barrett posted a video on social media with all of our email addresses, inviting people to contact us about trying to shut down an investigation of the RCMP. As a result, my staff had to open a subfolder in my inbox and labelled it "misogyny", because of the horrific emails and messages I was getting on social media.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8289998" data-originallang="en">Do you have any thoughts on the direction in which our country has gone in the last few years? I've been called a traitor; I've been told that the government is corrupt. I often say to people to take a look at Afghanistan, take a look at what's going on in the Middle East right now if you actually want to see countries where there are terrorists running a country, as in Gaza. You have Afghanistan, where women and girls have no rights at all. It really troubles me when people are making comparisons with other countries around the world like Russia—comparing Canada with that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8289999" data-originallang="en">Your comments then have been proven correct, Mr. Wernick. Unfortunately, I've been a target of all of those kinds of comments. Do you have any comment as to how we can try to get back to a more civilized discussion on issues?</p>
