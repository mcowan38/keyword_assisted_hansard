It is one of those tools, whether on campus or in municipal governments, that allows anti-Semitism to be identified, and when we can identify it, we can seek strategies for dealing with it.</p>

We've seen it implemented on campuses in the U.S., Europe and the U.K., and its use is something that we continue to advocate. The IHRA definition of anti-Semitism being adopted is a key part in being able to combat anti-Semitism like BDS.</p>
