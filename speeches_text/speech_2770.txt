<p data-HoCid="7961476" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, on day 13 of the war between Israel and Hamas, humanitarian needs are more urgent than ever. The United States announced $100 million in humanitarian aid, while Canada announced too little. Even more important than money is assurance that the aid will reach the civilians who so desperately need it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7961477" data-originallang="fr">As we speak, only 20 trucks have been permitted to enter Gaza. According to the UN, 100 trucks a day is the minimum required. The current number does not even come close. Has the Prime Minister spoken with Israel and with Egypt to urge better access for the delivery of humanitarian assistance?</p>
