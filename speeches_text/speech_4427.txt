<p data-HoCid="8455673" data-originallang="en"> Madam Chair and members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to speak on behalf of Concordia University.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455674" data-originallang="en">Concordia has 50,000 students and staff, and our downtown campus is on two of the busiest streets in Montreal.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455675" data-originallang="fr">We welcome students from all over the world. This diversity is an asset for us. We are proud of our Jewish community, which has shaped Concordia's identity and achievements throughout its history. We are also proud of our Palestinian, Arab and Muslim communities. They also contribute to Concordia's character and its many successes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455676" data-originallang="en"> The horrific attacks by Hamas on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza have exposed divisions in Canadian society, which are also reflected at Concordia. Many members of our community have suffered profound anguish, trauma and loss. In circumstances like these, our first responsibility is to show empathy and support for all, but given the level of fear and anger the conflict is causing, empathy and compassion can only accomplish so much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455677" data-originallang="en">I don't pretend to have perfect answers or actions to share with you. Everyone is struggling with the polarized environment and the complexity of the challenges we face. What I can say categorically is that there's no place for hate at Concordia. We're all disgusted by the rise of anti-Semitism, the spread of Islamophobia and the proliferation of identity-based hatred and violence.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455678" data-originallang="en">Canadian universities embody academic freedom, freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. They should be places of civil and evidence-informed reflection and debate. They also need to be places where people—above all, our students—feel safe and where everyone can participate in campus life without fear of intimidation and harassment.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455679" data-originallang="en"> Sadly, the lived experience of some members of our community has been tarnished by real and perceived acts of contempt, intolerance and hate. A stark example occurred on November 8, when there was an altercation between students and external individuals in one of our buildings downtown. Campus safety personnel tried to defuse the situation, but ultimately had to call the police. Two individuals were arrested. Disciplinary processes followed and continue even now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455680" data-originallang="en">That incident gave Concordia a black eye. It raised legitimate questions about how we both uphold our values and ensure a safe environment for everyone.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455681" data-originallang="fr">Since then, we have adapted and expanded our approach to dialogue and conflict resolution. We work with student groups on a regular basis. We have met with our union leaders. We have refused or cancelled certain events that we considered likely to lead to a climate of intimidation. These events were planned by both pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli organizations. I have also spoken directly to the community on several occasions and, each time, I have emphasized our collective role in finding solutions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455682" data-originallang="en"> Have our responses to every situation been perfect? No, but our actions have been rooted in careful consideration and an attempt to balance the different rights at play, and our community has largely responded in kind.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455683" data-originallang="en">Following the November incident, both pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian groups regularly held information tables and events throughout the remainder of the academic year. On one occasion in January, those tables were next to each other. Were we nervous about that event? Yes, but we had all learned from the bad experience in November. The mood was civil. There were no incidents.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455684" data-originallang="en"> However, in March, there was a disgraceful attack by a small number of individuals on the Hillel club. Campus safety intervened quickly, but it was another painful event for our community.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455685" data-originallang="en">I share these examples, both positive and negative, to be transparent. Yes, tensions exist at Concordia, but there has also been a remarkable calm. This does not mean all is well. That's why our commitment to combatting anti-Semitism and all forms of hate is ongoing. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8455686" data-originallang="en">In April, we launched a task force against racism and identity-based violence, involving faculty, staff, students and alumni. Our goal is to develop actionable recommendations to improve policies, training and complaint processes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455687" data-originallang="en"> At Concordia, we will continue to make every effort to ensure everyone can participate fully, openly and, yes, proudly in our campus life.</p>
