<p data-HoCid="8693813" data-originallang="en">I think we're really at a pivot point in terms of U.S. policy. If there is a Trump administration, I think it's quite clear that a Trump administration would give Prime Minister Netanyahu and his far-right government a green light to do whatever they want. He's already talking about wrapping up the war in Gaza very quickly, but I think that might well be followed by support for Israeli annexation measures in the West Bank, as well as potentially annexing parts of the Gaza Strip. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693814" data-originallang="en">Again, that underlines the need for making it very clear where the international community stands and making it very clear that Israeli annexation of the West Bank would be illegal and unacceptable. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693815" data-originallang="en">Conversely, I think a Harris administration is likely to shift or depart somewhat. I don't think there's going to be a radical shift from the Biden administration's approach, but clearly there is a recognition that the approach that the Biden administration has taken, however well-meaning, has failed. For many months now, the Biden administration has put its hopes in achieving a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, followed by a resumption of negotiations and tying that to the possibility of a normalization agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia and a broader agreement between the United States and the Saudis. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693816" data-originallang="en">Were that possible and were that in the cards, I would be less forceful in advocating a recognition of a Palestinian state. However, I don't think that's going to happen. It's very clear that this government in Israel is not interested in a Palestinian state and is certainly not interested in a resumption of peace talks. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693817" data-originallang="en">It's really important, given the fact that the U.S. policy is currently very much in flux, not to wait for U.S. leadership and certainly not to wait for the Trump administration, because they've made it very clear that they have no regard for international law. I think they would support the kind of far-right ambitions of the Israeli government. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693818" data-originallang="en">I think it is important to signal to the Harris administration, were that to come into office, where the international community stands and where the United States' allies stand. The Europeans are doing the same, and at the moment, I think the United States could actually take heed from its allies, particularly from Canada.</p>
