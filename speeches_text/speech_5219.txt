<p data-HoCid="8679162" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much for the question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679163" data-originallang="en">I think you're absolutely correct that Spain, Sweden and, of course, the Norway of the Oslo accords have recognized Palestine, yet have zero interest in recognizing terrorist activity or supporting Hamas. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679164" data-originallang="en">Again, I think the question, in part, goes back to what Ambassador Allen was saying, which is that Hamas doesn't want a two-state solution. That's very important to recognize. Neither government—Israel or Hamas—wants a two-state solution. It is my opinion, having thought about this and worked on this issue for a long time, that it is the civilians who want a two-state solution. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679165" data-originallang="en">Recognition is not in favour of the current Israeli government or any particular entity in Palestine. It is the right thing to do. It is the right of the Palestinian people, and it is the right of the Israeli people. </p>
