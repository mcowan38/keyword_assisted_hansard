<p data-HoCid="8733766" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733767" data-originallang="en">I'll comment in the context of social media, which is where I do a lot of my work. I've done quite a bit of work on this recently.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733768" data-originallang="en">Our freedom of thought and opinion is being essentially hacked by the algorithms and ads on social media. They structure the spaces in a particular way. The algorithms push certain information at you. It might be repetitive information. It's the idea that you end up down a rabbit hole. It undermines your own agency to freely develop your thoughts. We're seeing that to the extent that everyone ends up in their silos when it comes to the political information they're consuming.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733769" data-originallang="en"> In the context of children, I look at the wider gamut of these issues. We're seeing it pushing eating disorders and self-harm content at children, etc.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733770" data-originallang="en"> From a broader perspective, I thought it was interesting that you asked a question about what harm freedom of expression has caused. I want to bring us back to that legal threshold, because freedom of expression causes all kinds of harm. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8733771" data-originallang="en">We believe in the importance of freedom of expression. It's so key that we're willing to put up with that. Legally, there is a threshold in all kinds of circumstances where that harm is too great and the law intervenes. The law is used to defend reputations, but there is quite a high threshold in defamation law when it comes to finding that reputational harm is actually a legal issue, and where the law will intervene in some way to shut that down. We see this in criminal law, whether it's hate propaganda or fraud.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733772" data-originallang="en">We're in a complex space now. This is always highly contextual. In social media, we have this massive volume. We can't deal with it at scale.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733773" data-originallang="en"> This will be my last comment: “From the river to the sea” has been a point of controversy. Meta's oversight board did an entire investigation of that and made a determination on whether it fell afoul of their terms and conditions of service, looking at it through international human rights. These issues are being decided in all kinds of corners. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8733774" data-originallang="en">I'll leave it there for now.</p>
