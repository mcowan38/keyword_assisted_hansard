<p data-HoCid="6063816" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, our positions are consistent. We stand up for human rights everywhere around the world, whether it be in Sri Lanka or in Iran.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6063817" data-originallang="en"> Indeed, in asking about Iran, that is why Canada led a resolution at the United Nations in November 2019, calling on Iran to comply with its international human rights obligations. We deeply oppose Iran's support for terrorist organizations, its threats toward Israel, its ballistic missile program and its support for the murderous Assad regime.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6063818" data-originallang="en"> We will continue to defend human rights and hold Iran to account for its actions, as we do all around the world, including in Sri Lanka.</p>
