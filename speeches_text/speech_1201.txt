<p data-HoCid="6832736" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6832737" data-originallang="en">Hello, colleagues. <em>Bonjour</em>. <em>Aaniin</em>. <em>Assalamu alaikum</em>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6832738" data-originallang="en">I join you from my home in Peterborough—Kawartha on Michi Saagiig and Anishinabek territory.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6832739" data-originallang="en"> I am so grateful to all of you for your work. Truly, your work has never been more important. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6832740" data-originallang="en">I would like to acknowledge my wonderful parliamentary secretary, Gudie Hutchings, who consistently reminds us to look out for the most rural and the most isolated. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6832741" data-originallang="en">I would also like to wish the public service a happy National Public Service Week. This has been a difficult 16 months for all of us, but you have been there for Canadians in their time of need. If we're number one in the G7 and G20 for vaccine administration with the first dose and if Canada is going to be okay on the other side of this pandemic, it's truly because of public servants like you. We appreciate you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6832742" data-originallang="en">I'd also like to acknowledge that it is Pride Month. Happy Pride. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6832743" data-originallang="en">Happy Filipino Heritage Month. Many thanks to Salma Zahid for bringing that bill forward.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6832744" data-originallang="en">Of course, it's also National Indigenous History Month, which is a time for all of us to reflect collectively and to learn more. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6832745" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, I am so grateful to be here today as we reflect on the upcoming Canada Day, which will be better than the last one we had. There is more to be optimistic about and more to be hopeful about. With 75% of the population here in Peterborough—Kawartha having received their first dose, we are close to putting the pandemic behind us. Even as we do that, we recognize there is work to do. We all have to survey the damage that the pandemic caused, roll up our sleeves, build back better systems and institutions, and create a million jobs by the end of this year.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6832746" data-originallang="en">There are also many reckonings happening. There is climate change, the horrendous experiences of our elders in long-term care, Black Lives Matter, #MeToo, who is an essential worker and pay equity. The rate of femicide continues to increase. Anti-Asian rhetoric and anti-Asian hate is increasing, as is anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. The bodies of 215 children being discovered—and many more each and every day—offers an opportunity to us as Canadians to have courageous conversations and to move forward in a better way.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6832747" data-originallang="en">I was in London this weekend and was grateful to see MP Mathyssen and her mom, as well as Salma Zahid, <a data-HoCid="271245" href="/politicians/omar-alghabra/" title="Omar Alghabra">Minister Alghabra</a>, <a data-HoCid="252899" href="/politicians/peter-fragiskatos/" title="Peter Fragiskatos">Peter Fragiskatos</a> and <a data-HoCid="252826" href="/politicians/kate-young/" title="Kate Young">Kate Young</a>. We witnessed the burial of four bodies—three women and a man. These were four lives that ended too soon. These folks were targeted because of how they worship in a country like Canada. The accused for this terrorist act is a 20-year-old and I reflect on the fact that it has been 20 years since 9/11. The rhetoric, policies, politics and decisions made since 9/11, I have to accept, has all fuelled hate. We must work together to address and to stop those seeds of hate. There is clearly a need to have a conversation about Islamophobia and all forms of hate. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6832748" data-originallang="en">I want to thank the chair of our justice committee and the chair of the Liberal women's caucus, <a data-HoCid="252733" href="/politicians/iqra-khalid/" title="Iqra Khalid">Iqra Khalid</a>, for bravely standing up in the House of Commons in 2017 and asking us to study Islamophobia. Because of her, we have the tools, the lexicon and the partnerships to fight Islamophobia. That fight, for her, was not an easy one to fight. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6832749" data-originallang="en">Our oppressions are connected, whether it is sexism, misogyny, racism, ableism, homophobia, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia or other forms of hate. It is only truly together that we can put an end to the hate and violence and build back better communities, stronger advocacy networks and programs that put an end to violence and ensure that every Canadian is safe. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6832750" data-originallang="en">I am hopeful and optimistic, because despite COVID, we are moving forward. We are protecting progress. I truly hope that we all support budget 2021 because it includes historic investments that those who have come before us have fought for.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6832751" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair. </p>
