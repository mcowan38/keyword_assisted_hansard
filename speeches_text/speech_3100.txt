<p data-HoCid="8052304" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, Canada's leading humanitarian aid agencies have united together to call for a ceasefire in Gaza. People in Nanaimoâ€”Ladysmith are demanding action from the federal government.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8052305" data-originallang="en"> All hostages need to be released and a ceasefire declared so that no more children are killed, but the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> does not seem to recognize the killing of over 13,000 innocent civilians and more than 1.7 million displaced is an atrocity and it must end now.</p>
