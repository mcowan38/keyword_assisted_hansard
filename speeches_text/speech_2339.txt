<p data-HoCid="7733290" data-originallang="fr">Madam Chair, I thank the member for her speech and all the work she is doing to end gender-based violence. We need the government to provide immediate investments for a red dress alert system to notify the public when an indigenous woman, girl or two-spirit person is reported missing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7733291" data-originallang="fr">Budget 2023 recognized the need for an alert system. However, the Liberals refuse to fund and set a deadline for its implementation. The member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>, the member for <a data-HoCid="278704" href="/politicians/lori-idlout/" title="Lori Idlout">Nunavut</a> and the member for <a data-HoCid="278619" href="/politicians/blake-desjarlais/" title="Blake Desjarlais">Edmonton Griesbach</a> have been fighting hard for far too long. The families and victims have been bearing the burden of change for far too long.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7733292" data-originallang="fr">Can the member tell us how urgent it is for the government to take action right away? </p>
