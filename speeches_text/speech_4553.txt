<p data-HoCid="8479611" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you very much to all the witnesses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479612" data-originallang="en"> The testimony you have provided has been very powerful. I know it wasn't easy, but I think you have all established that Islamophobia, regrettably, is alive and well and that as a country, we should be doing much better to combat Islamophobia, much as we do with other hate crimes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479613" data-originallang="en"> I will start off with Dr. Islam.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479614" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Fortin started off with a question about whether there are commonalities between Islamophobia and anti-Semitism. The reason is that he was wondering whether we could use the same tools for combatting Islamophobia. Obviously, both of them are disconcerting.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479615" data-originallang="en">You had the opportunity to say that in certain respects, there were overlaps between the two. However, I suspect you also wanted to elaborate on what the particularities of Islamophobia are and why that's significant. Am I correct in my assessment, and would you care to elaborate on that point?</p>
