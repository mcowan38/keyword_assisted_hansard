<p data-HoCid="6403263" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Minister, for coming and speaking with us today and talking about the importance of multilateralism. It's been good to hear about all the work you're doing. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6403264" data-originallang="en">One of the things I want to talk with you about today is something that has been coming up in question period a lot, and that is our recent vote on Israel and actually on Palestine. I'm raising it because I'm Jewish and have been to Israel a couple of times myself. I am a strong supporter of Israel, and yet I am concerned that there has been a bit of a perspective put out there that says there is a unilateral Jewish point of view on this, instead of the fact that it's a community that in fact has many different points of view on things.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6403265" data-originallang="en"> While our community might support Israel wholeheartedly, stand as an ally to Israel and believe very much in the importance of Israel's peace and security, it's not true that everyone would oppose the position that Canada has taken on that vote.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6403266" data-originallang="en">I just wanted to ask you some questions. My first one is pretty basic. Is this the same resolution, essentially, that our country supported in 2019?</p>
