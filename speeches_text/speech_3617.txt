<p data-HoCid="8276164" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I listened to the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="MÃ©lanie Joly">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> deliver what I thought was a very thoughtful articulation of what is actually taking place. I thought she articulated a reflection of what true Canadian values are. This is not an easy topic; it is a heart-wrenching discussion among families throughout Canada. It is a disservice by the member across the way to try to imply that the Government of Canada is off track. Whether with the war in Ukraine or what is happening today in Israel, I think this is a government that very much reflects the values of Canadians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8276165" data-originallang="en">I wonder whether the member could indicate whether she really believes that everything she says is a true reflection of Canadians as a whole and what our values are.</p>
