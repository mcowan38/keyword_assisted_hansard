<p data-HoCid="6081229" data-originallang="en">I can support the amendment. It's important, though, that we recognize that we want to investigate ways that we as a federal government can make more money for housing available.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6081230" data-originallang="en">To MP Vaughan's point, you can go province to province. You can say the government in New Brunswick isn't spending enough money on affordable housing, but maybe the government in New Brunswick ran on a platform of more austerity.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6081231" data-originallang="en">I'm good with the amendment. I certainly will support it. I thank MP Kusie for bringing the whole thing forward. I caution, though, that we don't want to go down a rabbit hole of going province by province and looking at each government. Every government has a different platform and a different strategy on housing, which, obviously, we may not agree with. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6081232" data-originallang="en">Anyway, I will just throw that out there.</p>
