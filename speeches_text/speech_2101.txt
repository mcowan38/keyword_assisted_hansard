<p data-HoCid="7598982" data-originallang="en"> I worked at the Jewish General Hospital in Montreal, running a group at their day care program of 10-year-old boys using drama therapy. Definitely, the ongoing improvements that were seen by their teachers were clear.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7598983" data-originallang="en">I've also done drama therapy online, with young adults who were depressed during the pandemic. We did MRI scans through the University of Toronto. Those MRI scans proved that the work we were doing online, just the connection, was in fact effective. That's really great to hear. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7598984" data-originallang="en"> I do somatic work as well. A lot of the somatic work that I do is actually getting people into their bodies so that that anxiety comes down.</p>
