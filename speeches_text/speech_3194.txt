<p data-HoCid="8124678" data-originallang="en">Pursuant to Standing Order 108(2), the committee will proceed to a briefing on the situation in Israel and Gaza.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8124679" data-originallang="en">I'd like to welcome our two witnesses from Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development. We are fortunate to have with us today Mr. Alexandre Lévêque, assistant deputy minister for Europe, Arctic, Middle East and Maghreb. We also have Mr. Sébastien Beaulieu, director general and chief security officer in security and emergency management. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8124680" data-originallang="en">I understand that there's only one opening remark. Is that correct, Mr. Lévêque?</p>
