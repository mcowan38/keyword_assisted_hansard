<p data-HoCid="6692033" data-originallang="en"> Thank you for the important question, Mr. Diotte.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6692034" data-originallang="en">As you know, UNRWA provides education to over 500,000 vulnerable Palestinian children in five different areas. Canada has been a long-standing partner of UNRWA. I also want to recognize and welcome that the U.S. government has made a commitment to re-engaging with and re-supporting UNRWA.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6692035" data-originallang="en">As soon as I learned of this issue, I contacted my officials. I had a conversation with the commissioner-general of UNRWA. We have been engaged very thoroughly in what happened and in understanding what happened. We are working with UNRWA to ensure that they have the policies in place to ensure that something like this doesn't happen again. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6692036" data-originallang="en">It was an oversight, but UNRWA recognizes this and they are very committed to ensuring that the materials they provide do align with UN values.</p>
