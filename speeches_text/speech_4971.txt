<p data-HoCid="8594789" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, last week, I learned that the member likes to sing as much as our Bloc colleague from <a data-HoCid="278345" href="/politicians/caroline-desbiens/" title="Caroline Desbiens">Charlevoix</a> does.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8594790" data-originallang="fr">It is rather impressive to take part in international forums and to see the issues that are discussed there. Those are fundamentally important issues. Take, for example, the situation in Gaza, the situation in Ukraine and the conflicts that are happening around the world.</p>
