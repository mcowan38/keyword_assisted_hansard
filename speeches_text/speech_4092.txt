<p data-HoCid="8406075" data-originallang="en">One thing I wanted to tell you about is something that happened to me. The other day I went to the McGill encampment to watch it, and when I came back home, I found out there was a video, a full three-minute video about me, and pictures of me and videos of me on Instagram with more than 100,000 views, which had been posted by the pro-Palestinian, pro-Hamas students saying that I'm dangerous, that I'm an ex-IDF soldier and that if you see me on the street to call the police. I'm an international student, so they told people to file complaints against me with the immigration system so it would not renew my study permit or my student visa. My friend Anastasia—she's here too—and I had to hire private security to protect ourselves. I will never forget the moment in November 2023, after the November 8 incident, when I got a phone call from my mother, and she said to come back to Israel because it was safer there than in Canada. That's all I have to say. </p>
