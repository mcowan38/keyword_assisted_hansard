<p data-HoCid="8417181" data-originallang="en"> Madam Chair, there is nothing precluding the <a data-HoCid="299996" href="/politicians/arif-virani/" title="Arif Virani">minister</a> from setting out certain expectations. I think that is very well and good to be established, and still keeping an organization within the Justice Department at arm's length.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8417182" data-originallang="en">I want to move on. Today I subbed in at the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, which is currently looking at the issues of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. It is quite obvious that Jews across Canada are reporting a terrifying increase of hate directed toward them as an identifiable group.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8417183" data-originallang="en">One of the recommendations that emerged at today's meeting was to ban symbols of hate. My colleague, the NDP member for <a data-HoCid="278709" href="/politicians/peter-julian/" title="Peter Julian">New Westminsterâ€”Burnaby</a>, has introduced Bill <a data-HoCid="11471425" href="/bills/44-1/C-229/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (banning symbols of hate)">C-229</a>, which would amend the Criminal Code to broaden the provisions related to hate propaganda by making it an offence to publicly display visual representations that promote or incite hatred or violence against an identifiable group. Can the minister comment on this particular initiative and whether the Government of Canada will support it?</p>
