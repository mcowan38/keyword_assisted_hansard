<p data-HoCid="8435127" data-originallang="fr">My name is Cary Kogan and I am a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Ottawa.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435128" data-originallang="en"> We are the co-founders of the Network of Engaged Canadian Academics, or NECA. NECA is a non-partisan group of Jewish and non-Jewish academics who are united in our shared concerns about rising anti-Semitism on Canadian campuses. We are a Canadian network of more than 300 academics from 40 universities and colleges across all disciplines. We advocate for academic freedom, diverse perspectives and an expansive understanding of inclusion. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8435129" data-originallang="en">Anti-Semitism is flourishing on campuses. It has reached crisis levels and represents a serious threat to Canadian democracy. It should trouble us all. </p>
