<p data-HoCid="6644298" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Ms. Gazan. That concludes the time we have.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6644299" data-originallang="en">Ms. Pohlmann, I want to thank you for your patience, first and foremost. Although it appears that you've been shortchanged in terms of your time before the committee, we got you all to ourselves, so you probably faced twice as many questions in the last half hour as you would have if you had to share the stage. We certainly appreciate the advice that the CFIB gives to successive governments, and it has been doing so for 50 years.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6644300" data-originallang="en">I would be remiss if, before we adjourn, I didn't point out to you some of the excellent work that has been done in my province of Prince Edward Island by Erin McGrath-Gaudet over the years. She has been an extremely articulate advocate for small business, to the point where the last time the government changed she was hired as the deputy minister of economic growth. The credibility that she has with the business community is serving her and the new government here in Prince Edward Island very well. If that's an indicator of the calibre of talent you have, you have another 50 years in you.</p>
