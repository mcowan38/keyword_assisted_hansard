<p data-HoCid="8396522" data-originallang="fr"> Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8396523" data-originallang="fr">Minister Hussen, I would like to welcome you to our committee. We appreciate having you here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8396524" data-originallang="fr">I'll keep talking about the situation in Gaza. Cindy McCain, the director of the World Food Programme, said that northern Gaza is in fullâ€‘blown famine. It's unbelievable that the situation has reached this point. I find it appalling that my Conservative colleagues are saying that we should stop funding the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, or UNRWA. If we did that, hundreds of thousands of people would die.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8396525" data-originallang="fr">What more can be done to help? How can this organization's funding provide immediate assistance and help prevent this humanitarian disaster?</p>
