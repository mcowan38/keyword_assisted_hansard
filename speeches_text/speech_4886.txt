<p data-HoCid="8576538" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, this is a question that I find a bit troubling because, in the same question, my colleague says that there is a group that is tired of being instrumentalized and wants to confront Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which I support wholeheartedly. These are people who have the courage to say things and who do not want to be instrumentalized.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576539" data-originallang="fr">Now, this evening, we are engaged in an emergency debate that calls on us to have an impact on peace in Lebanon and to do something about populations in danger, especially Canadian citizens in Lebanon. How can we help them get out of there?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576540" data-originallang="fr">What I have just heard is my colleague instrumentalizing a group for partisan purposes in a debate that has nothing to do with the question that I was asked.</p>
