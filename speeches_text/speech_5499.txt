<p data-HoCid="8703178" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8703179" data-originallang="en">I want to thank the witnesses for being here this afternoon to offer their important opinions. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8703180" data-originallang="en">Dr. Awad, I have a couple of questions for you. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8703181" data-originallang="en">Some of the questions that are being asked are about the timing of the recognition. Why change the traditional Canadian policy over the last two decades of waiting until everything is finally negotiated before the recognition of the State of Palestine? Why do you think we should recognize the State of Palestine as quickly as possible?</p>
