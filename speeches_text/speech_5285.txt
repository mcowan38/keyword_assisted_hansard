<p data-HoCid="8693709" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693710" data-originallang="en">Thank you to the standing committee for the opportunity to talk with you today about Canada's advancement of a two-state solution.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693711" data-originallang="en">Let me begin by saying that I continue to believe that a two-state solution remains the best means for bringing peace to both Israelis and Palestinians. The terrible bloodshed and tragedy over the past year I think underscores the urgent need to bring peace to both peoples. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693712" data-originallang="en">I think we also have to recognize that the two-state solution is more endangered today, more at risk today, than it has ever been before. The possibility of a two-state solution is diminishing day by day. I think unless significant action is taken, it will soon disappear altogether. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693713" data-originallang="en">I believe that the most important action Canada could take to save a two-state solution would be to recognize the State of Palestine, as Spain, Norway, and Ireland, of course, already did earlier this year, and as just over 75% of the UN members have done. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693714" data-originallang="en">Now, some argue that recognition of Palestinian statehood would be an empty gesture. On the contrary; I think if Canada were to recognize the Palestinian state, it would make Canada's recognition of the Palestinian right to self-determination and Canada's support for a two-state solution not merely empty rhetoric. Recognition would be a tangible step that Canada could take to help Palestinians achieve their long-standing quest for national self-determination. Recognition of a Palestinian state at this point in time would help keep the possibility of a two-state solution alive. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693715" data-originallang="en">I think there is a real danger that this possibility will soon disappear. If Palestinians don't achieve statehood soon, they will likely, as I think surveys show, give up on support for a Palestinian state and increasingly demand equal rights in a one-state framework, as younger Palestinians are already doing. If that becomes the Palestinian norm, then rather than the pursuit of statehood, there will be a very long—I think decades-long—struggle for equal rights within a single state. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693716" data-originallang="en">Recognition of a Palestinian state would also boost Palestinian support for a two-state solution and save the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority, of course, was established under the Oslo accords as an interim step toward the establishment of the Palestinian state. It has essentially lost its legitimacy among the Palestinian public. I think it could well collapse in the next few years, forcing Israel to take over complete responsibility for the West Bank. Recognizing a Palestinian state I think would really help boost the legitimacy of a reformed Palestinian Authority—I want to emphasize that—in the eyes of the Palestinian public. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693717" data-originallang="en">It would also, of course, increase diplomatic pressure on Israel to end its illegal occupation of Palestinian territories and its ongoing settlement activity there. The stationing of international diplomats in the West Bank could also increase scrutiny of Israel's actions in the West Bank. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693718" data-originallang="en">I want to emphasize that recognizing a Palestinian state is not an alternative to peace talks. On the contrary; I think it's a means to help peace talks succeed. Ultimately, the only solution to the conflict lies in a negotiated solution, but in order to reach such a solution, I think we need to ensure that the prospects for a negotiation are more likely to succeed. Recognizing Palestinian statehood would help do that. It would help to put it on equal par with Israel so that it would be negotiations between two states, the state of Israel and the State of Palestine. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693719" data-originallang="en">You've already heard earlier today the claim that recognition of Palestinian statehood would be a reward for Hamas's terrorism, but this completely ignores the fact that Hamas does not support a two-state solution. Hamas does not want a Palestinian state alongside Israel; they want a Palestinian state instead of Israel. On the contrary—to the speakers earlier today—recognizing Palestinian statehood would actually undermine and weaken support for Hamas by showing Palestinians that there is an alternative path—a non-violent path, a diplomatic path—to help them achieve their legitimate rights. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693720" data-originallang="en">Finally, contrary to the claim that some may make that now is not the time to recognize Palestinian statehood and that we should wait, I think waiting will in fact only make the situation worse. Support for a two-state solution is declining day by day. Conditions on the ground, in particular in the West Bank, are continuing to deteriorate. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693721" data-originallang="en">After what we witnessed over the past year, and particularly what we saw on October 7, it is very clear that managing this conflict and going along with the usual means is not working. It's not bringing safety to Israelis and it's not bringing rights or security to Palestinians. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693722" data-originallang="en"> I think what's urgently needed is bold action to save a two-state solution, and this is the best action Canada can take in the near term to help achieve and create the conditions for a successful two-state solution.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693723" data-originallang="en"> Thank you for your time. I welcome any questions.</p>
