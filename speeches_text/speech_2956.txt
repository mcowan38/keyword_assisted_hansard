<p data-HoCid="8017965" data-originallang="en">On your comment about <em>Groundhog Day</em>, I was thinking something similar earlier. We've had so many meetings at this committee where the rail companies have come to talk in glowing terms about their safety record. Then we hear from the watchdogs, the Auditor General and the Transportation Safety Board. They share a very different story. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8017966" data-originallang="en">The message that I hear, particularly from Kathy Fox and the Transportation Safety Board, is that Canadians should continue to be very concerned because the progress has been far too slow in addressing the identified shortcomings of the rail safety system. The companies are not willing to make the investments they need to make. The government—I think this is the larger issue—and Transport Canada are not willing to stand up to them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8017967" data-originallang="en"> I was speaking with a bureaucrat who's now in a different department, and it was interesting. He described the regulatory approach in different sectors. He said that when it comes to the air sector the federal government has a pretty hands-on approach. They have a good line of sight of what's going on. When it comes to the marine sector they have a pretty strong regulatory approach. But when it comes to railroads, it does seem like these companies are bigger than the government. The government doesn't have what it takes to actually regulate them in a way that protects the public from the things like we've seen at Lac-Mégantic, Saskatchewan, and of course across the border in East Palestine.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8017968" data-originallang="en">To what degree should Canadians still be concerned about the inadequacies and lack of effective regulation in the rail sector?</p>
