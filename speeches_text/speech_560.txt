<p data-HoCid="6474144" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for <a data-HoCid="253019" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> for her question. I recognize her passion for the less fortunate and underprivileged in the world, and certainly her community in the heart of Winnipeg is no exception.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6474145" data-originallang="en">I also want to acknowledge an organization in the member's riding, Adult &amp; Teen Challenge, and its former executive director, Steve Paulson, as well as Daniel, who is now in charge. It does a tremendous amount of work. I talked to some organization members recently, and they indicated that they were running at capacity. Adult &amp; Teen Challenge is an organization that offers hope to people struggling with addiction and substance abuse. It has a very effective program that reaches people in the area, which is right in the member's riding, and I know that she is connected with them, and that is tremendous. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6474146" data-originallang="en">I think we need to give people the opportunity to succeed financially and to earn a living. The best way to lift people out of poverty is to provide jobs for them so that they can look after themselves. We also need to keep our eye focused, as I said, on part 7 of the bill before us, because it would increase our national debt level to the point that we would have to increase taxation, and we would reduce the wiggle room we have to provide adequate social services for folks who really need it, such as folks in her riding. </p>
