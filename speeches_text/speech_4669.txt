<p data-HoCid="8520277" data-originallang="en">That leads me, then, to a question that Mr. Mendicino brought up and that Monsieur Fortin then brought up, which is how we're dealing with anti-Semitic hate in this country, and other forms of hate such as Islamophobia.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8520278" data-originallang="en"> I want to refer you to recent statements made by Adil Charkaoui. Mr. Charkaoui, in Montreal, on October 28 of last year, made a speech in Arabic, in which he said, “Allah, take care of these Zionist aggressors. Allah, take care of the enemies of the people of Gaza. Allah, identify them all, then exterminate them. Don't spare any of them.” The Quebec prosecution service, the DPCP, determined that there wasn't sufficient evidence to reveal the commission of a criminal offence under, I presume, sections 318 and 319 of the Criminal Code.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8520279" data-originallang="en">Mr. Dolhai, would your office in any way have been involved in offering advice on an issue like that, or will this be an issue in terms of the way we prosecute section 318 and 319 offences that you would undertake to make part of the next discussions with the provinces when you have future rounds of meetings?</p>
