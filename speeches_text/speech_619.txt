<p data-HoCid="6486969" data-originallang="en">Brooks is the “City of 100 Hellos”, and we do have a large number of different ethnic groups from all over the world.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6486970" data-originallang="en">It is a very big challenge when it comes to a lot of messaging. That has been proven during the COVID-19 pandemic, a public health nightmare. As well there's the difficulty of racial conflict, anti-Semitism, racism and Islamophobia.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6486971" data-originallang="en">The messaging, as John just mentioned, the way that we broadcast through the podcast, we reach out to every community through their own language, through their own culture. That reaching out helps the communities to stay in the rural area with their families, and to work and be part of the community they are in.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6486972" data-originallang="en">It is very critical to have that voice from newcomers, and the value added to the economic development of Canada in general, and all rural areas of Canada. It's very critical to have the voice of small services. It's very important to have the voice of every Canadian added to the value. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6486973" data-originallang="en"> I would encourage the committee to look into community radio, or any other means so that every voice from the Canadian perspective can be heard in a very effective manner.</p>
