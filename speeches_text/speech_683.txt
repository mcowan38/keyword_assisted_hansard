<p data-HoCid="6525720" data-originallang="en">Yes, and thanks, MP Gazan, for that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6525721" data-originallang="en">That's one of the key aspects of this bill. Not losing sight of the caregiver is the one thing I really want to make sure we're focused on, but also what comes next. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6525722" data-originallang="en">As you know, and in the conversations I've had with your colleague <a data-HoCid="252759" href="/politicians/daniel-blaikie/" title="Daniel Blaikie">MP Blaikie</a>, there is the need for EI to follow this bill. As private members, again, we can't change EI. We can't tell the government that it needs to spend more money, even though I know you and I both would probably want to do so at some point in our days. However, we want to make sure that, outside the scope of our private member's bill, that's what follows next.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6525723" data-originallang="en">I've had very encouraging conversations with the <a data-HoCid="253379" href="/politicians/filomena-tassi/" title="Filomena Tassi">minister</a>, parliamentary secretary and others as to those next steps.</p>
