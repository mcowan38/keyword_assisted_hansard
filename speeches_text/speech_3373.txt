<p data-HoCid="8172988" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8172989" data-originallang="en">I want to begin by thanking the committee for bringing this debate forward on Bill <a data-HoCid="12260777" href="/bills/44-1/C-318/" title="An Act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and the Canada Labour Code (adoptive and intended parents)">C-318</a>. I specifically want to thank the MP for Battlefords—Lloydminster for her work in bringing this study forward. I also want to say thank you to all the witnesses who testified and to all the parents and the adoptive parents for the incredible love and commitment they demonstrate. I believe the discussion we're having here....</p>
<p data-HoCid="8172990" data-originallang="en">The government bill that will be coming forward as well, which has already been tabled under Bill <a data-HoCid="12739107" href="/bills/44-1/C-59/" title="An Act to implement certain provisions of the fall economic statement tabled in Parliament on November 21, 2023 and certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on March 28, 2023">C-59</a>, also recognizes that selflessness, commitment and love of adoptive parents.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8172991" data-originallang="en">I also want to thank my colleague Ms. Gazan for bringing this very thoughtful amendment forward. We want to do everything possible to make sure not only that the federal laws and policies that we bring forward align with and are consistent with UNDRIP and our responsibilities under UNDRIP, but that our policies, programs and laws also reflect the priorities of first nations, Inuit and Métis people in our country. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8172992" data-originallang="en">This is an important amendment that has been brought forward, and I believe it's an amendment that ought to be studied further. I believe it requires additional research and thoughtful conversation, and above all careful and considerate consultation with first nations, Inuit and Métis across Canada. This is important. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8172993" data-originallang="en">Obviously, children are at the very centre and heart of the work of this government, and so for that reason I do believe there are questions about this amendment that need to be answered. There is information that needs to be brought forward. I believe that there ought to be a process in place whereby that information can come forward to members of this committee as well as to members of government in designing these policies. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8172994" data-originallang="en"> I do believe we are skipping an important step of consultation here, first and foremost, as well as deliberation and information, and so for that reason I will be abstaining from voting on this amendment.</p>
