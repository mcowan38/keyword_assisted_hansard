<p data-HoCid="8244471" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8244472" data-originallang="en">I'd like to ask my question of Ms. Paradkar.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8244473" data-originallang="en">In your presentation, you talked about the loss of critical voices in the media and about the harassment received by journalists who ask tough questions and seek to hold power to account, journalists like you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8244474" data-originallang="en">We referenced in the previous question the attacks on journalists who have been willing to speak about what is happening in Gaza and Palestine at this time. Do you think journalists are less willing to talk about important issues that exist, whether they be Palestine or others, because they think harassment and potential job loss simply aren't worth it?</p>
