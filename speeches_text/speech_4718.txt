<p data-HoCid="8510419" data-originallang="fr">Ms. Macfarlane, I haven't had a chance to ask you any questions yet.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8510420" data-originallang="fr">In your opinion, should we not put an end once and for all to discrimination, violence against the Muslim and Jewish communities, and all other forms of discrimination based on race, skin colour, gender or any other form? Have we not reached the point where we must ban all expressions of hatred from the public space? In short, shouldn't the promotion of hatred in Canada be prohibited, regardless of the reason given, including a religious text or an editorial?</p>
