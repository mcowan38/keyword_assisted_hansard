<p data-HoCid="8246397" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, we share an immense grief, and our hearts break for the tragic loss of civilian life. All of those impacted are at the forefront of our mind, including all families and communities affected by the violence. Children, in particular, have been disproportionately affected by the ongoing hostilities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8246398" data-originallang="en">The horrific attacks by Hamas against Israeli civilians still shock us all. I surely do remember, because October 7 was my 40th birthday. We are unequivocal in our condemnation of Hamas's terrorist attack against Israel, the appalling loss of life and the heinous acts of violence perpetrated in those attacks.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8246399" data-originallang="en">I want to thank the member for <a data-HoCid="278307" href="/politicians/bardish-chagger/" title="Bardish Chagger">Waterloo</a>, the member for <a data-HoCid="278775" href="/politicians/tim-louis/" title="Tim Louis">Kitchener—Conestoga</a>, the member for <a data-HoCid="278723" href="/politicians/valerie-bradford/" title="Valerie Bradford">Kitchener South—Hespeler</a> and the member for <a data-HoCid="278642" href="/politicians/bryan-may/" title="Bryan May">Cambridge</a> for advocating for solutions that respect both the Jewish community and the Palestinian community.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8246400" data-originallang="en">Canada condemns Hamas's unacceptable treatment of hostages and calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all remaining hostages.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8246401" data-originallang="en">What has been happening in Gaza is catastrophic. With the humanitarian situation already dire, the impacts of an expanded military operation in Rafah would be devastating for Palestinian civilians as well as for foreign nationals who are seeking refuge. They have nowhere else to go, and as the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">minister</a> has said, asking them to move again is simply unacceptable. The price of defeating Hamas cannot be the continued suffering of all Palestinian civilians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8246402" data-originallang="en">The violence must stop. That is why we have been calling for an immediate and sustainable ceasefire. This cannot be one-sided; Hamas must release all hostages and lay down its arms, and humanitarian aid must urgently be increased and sustained. The need for humanitarian assistance in Gaza has never been greater. Rapid, safe and unimpeded humanitarian relief must be provided to civilians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8246403" data-originallang="en">Canada will continue to work with its partners toward ensuring the sustained access of humanitarian assistance for civilians, including food, water, medical care, fuel, shelter and access to humanitarian workers. To date, Canada has announced $100 million in humanitarian assistance to address the urgent needs of vulnerable civilians in this crisis. We are clear that a sustainable ceasefire is necessary to finding a path toward securing lasting peace for Israelis and Palestinians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8246404" data-originallang="en">We have been calling for a ceasefire for two months, and we expect every party to join us if they have not done so already. Canada remains steadfast in our commitment to a two-state solution. This means the creation of a Palestinian state alongside an Israeli state, where Palestinians and Israelis live side by side in peace, security and dignity, just like they do in Canada.</p>
