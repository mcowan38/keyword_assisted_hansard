<p data-HoCid="7265199" data-originallang="en">Mr. Israel, you had referenced the WEF's known travel digital identity program. I've certainly heard from many constituents who are concerned about the idea of a very powerful type of digital ID. The government is participating in a pilot program in that regard. Do you have any concerns with the KTDI pilot program that you could outline to the committee, in particular if there's any concern about how a program like this may disproportionately affect certain elements of the population, whether they be people of colour, racial minorities, young, old, etc.?</p>
