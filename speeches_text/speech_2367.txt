<p data-HoCid="7732808" data-originallang="fr">Madam Chair, there are factors that make some communities more vulnerable, more at risk. That is the case for indigenous women and girls. Various studies have shown this to be true. Today I became aware of various documents indicating, based on evidence, that indigenous women and girls are vulnerable and at risk. We need to take care of them. It is important to recognize that. We also have to tell it like it is and take care of these women and girls.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7732809" data-originallang="fr">Today, under the leadership of our colleague from <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>, the House passed a very important, very interesting motion. She came up with an appropriate name for a tool similar to an Amber Alert, an alert that we could create here in Canada. It is indeed a very promising and interesting idea. We were very pleased to support it.</p>
