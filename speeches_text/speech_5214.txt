<p data-HoCid="8679143" data-originallang="en">Mr. Allen, my question is for you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679144" data-originallang="en">There appears to be confusion between a political recognition of the state of Palestine and a final status resolution or end to the conflict. Can you help us differentiate between a political recognition of the state of Palestine and the fact of the matter that, yes, there still need to be negotiations to resolve the final status?</p>
