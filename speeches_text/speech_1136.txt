<p data-HoCid="6791751" data-originallang="en">I noted that the government, during the recent conflict, highlighted the rocket attacks on Israel that were coming from the Gaza Strip. I also noted that the government's statement called on foreign entities that support Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad to end their material and financial support for these groups. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6791752" data-originallang="en">I'm assuming that the foreign entity that the government is referring to is the Islamic Republic of Iran. Is that correct?</p>
