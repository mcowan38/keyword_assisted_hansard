<p data-HoCid="8278237" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, today, the <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">leader of the official opposition</a> brings up the idea that he is interested in Canadians and he is interested in making life more affordable for Canadians, but we know that he voted against a national school program. We know he voted against our motion to take GST off of home heating. He voted against dental care. He voted against child care. Even yesterday, shockingly, he voted against getting humanitarian aid to Palestinians who are starving to death.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8278238" data-originallang="en">He does not care about Canadians. He does not care about people around the world. He has already said he would cut foreign aid. He has already said that he would cut all of these programs that make life more affordable for people. He is a one-trick pony with nothing to offer Canadians and Canadians know that.</p>
