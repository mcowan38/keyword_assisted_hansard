<p data-HoCid="8794007" data-originallang="en">We have heard that a commitment has been made by the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> to define anti-Palestinian racism, but again, it's weird that they've made the commitment to define it when they haven't actually officially recognized it. We're looking for them to recognize it. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8794008" data-originallang="en">In terms of defining it, we've done global consultations in Canada, the U.S., Palestine and Europe around the definition we have put together. There is a broad consensus over the paragraph we came up with. Each one of those terms in there came out of those consultations. It is important that we recognize the manifestation of anti-Palestinian racism, including Nakba denial and the smearing of advocates as being anti-Semitic or as terrorist supporters.</p>
