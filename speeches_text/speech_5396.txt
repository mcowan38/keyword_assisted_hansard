<p data-HoCid="8703302" data-originallang="en">Thank you so much for your question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703303" data-originallang="en"> I think, as we've stated here, that we are all looking for a two-state solution and for lasting peace. The main problem here is that we have an occupation that is going on. If you have a Palestinian people who are living under occupation, who cannot go from their homes to their work freely, and then you expect them to build a governance, to build a political system.... Yet the Palestinian people have done that, and we have institutions established. I'll give you the numbers.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703304" data-originallang="en"> Before 1992 and the Oslo accords, from 1967 to 1992, when Palestinians in the West Bank were under the occupation, the number of hospital beds increased by zero under the military rule of Israel. From 1992 until now—30 years—the number of hospital beds has quadrupled. It is the same thing with school chairs. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8703305" data-originallang="en">When Palestinians were given that sort of autonomy, they built an economy; they built ministries; they built institutions. There is the Palestine National Council, which has existed for 60 years now. There is the Palestinian Legislative Council. There are grounds that the Palestinian people have built and established toward establishing a Palestinian state, yet with the occupation, since 1996 the number of settlements has tripled. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8703306" data-originallang="en">Even since last July, Israel has, according to The Associated Press, seized the largest amount of land in the Jordan Valley—five square miles of land. They gave permits for 5,295 housing units to be built. When Canada and the international community recognize Palestine, that is going to tell the Israeli government that this is Palestine and that settlements have to stop.</p>
