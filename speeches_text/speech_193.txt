<p data-HoCid="6165669" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6165670" data-originallang="en">It's a privilege to hear your stories. I want to thank the four strong indigenous women witnesses today for their contributions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6165671" data-originallang="en">I want to acknowledge the intersectionalities of the impact and also say that I know I speak for everybody on this committee when I say that we are eager to help. We want to try to make things better, and your feedback and perspective and insight, and the feedback and perspective from the two indigenous women who serve on this community, <a data-HoCid="253019" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Ms. Gazan</a> and <a data-HoCid="255219" href="/politicians/mumilaaq-qaqqaq/" title="Mumilaaq Qaqqaq">Ms. Qaqqaq</a>, are super valuable in that pursuit.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6165672" data-originallang="en">The purpose of these forums is to provide feedback and criticism and recommendations, and I thank you for that so far. I don't want to talk for the duration of my five minutes. I want to hear from you and if I could, I'd just ask for some feedback on youth mental health. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6165673" data-originallang="en">I am the parliamentary secretary for youth, and I would love to hear from you on what we can be doing better to serve this very vulnerable section of the population in Canada, because youth mental health is something that comes up on every one of my youth calls.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6165674" data-originallang="en">Thank you so much for your feedback today, and I thank you in advance for your answers. </p>
