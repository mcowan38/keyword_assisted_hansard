<p data-HoCid="8396732" data-originallang="en"> My final question for you is with regard to sanctions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8396733" data-originallang="en"> In December we sent a letter asking that there be sanctions on extremist settlers in the West Bank. This was violence that was supported by extremist ministers in the Israeli government.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8396734" data-originallang="en"> We asked in February. It's now May, five months after we asked for this. Why is it taking the government so long, when other countries have already figured out how to put those sanctions in place? Is the delay, from your perspective, political or administrative?</p>
