<p data-HoCid="6447136" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6447137" data-originallang="en">I thank all the witnesses for appearing today. It's not very often that we have witnesses with the stature of Cardinal Collins and Rabbi Whitman before the committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6447138" data-originallang="en">Given that Cardinal Collins has had a fair degree of time, I want to focus my questions with Rabbi Whitman. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6447139" data-originallang="en">I think you are in a unique position as a witness here, because you've come to us as both a legal scholar and a biblical scholar. Therefore, my question for you, first, would be, do you see anything in this bill generally or specifically that you feel would limit you in the carrying out of your professional duties and responsibilities, or spiritual duties and responsibilities, as a rabbi?</p>
