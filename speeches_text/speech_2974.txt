<p data-HoCid="8027970" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Julian, your time is up.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8027971" data-originallang="fr">Ms. Tait, I would like to ask you a few questions on a topic that many people are talking about this morning, i.e., comments made by Ms. Thomas in committee. Last week, she said that if CBC/Radio-Canada did not directly associate Hamas with terrorism, it was because the CBC was siding with the terrorists.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8027972" data-originallang="fr">Shortly thereafter, people on the ground in Israel reported that a Radio-Canada journalist, Jean-François Bélanger, had his camera literally ripped off him. The camera's memory cards were taken out. That's pretty aggressive.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8027973" data-originallang="fr">If this kind of narrative is kept up and not eliminated, do you fear that journalists on the ground will be faced with increasingly hostile conditions?</p>
