<p data-HoCid="7957826" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I always appreciate my colleague's speeches, which are both passionate and, above all, intelligent, even if we do not always agree.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957827" data-originallang="fr">However, tonight we agree on one point. I think the whole House of Commons and every party agrees that it is absolutely necessary, and urgent, to establish a humanitarian corridor. Everyone here tonight agrees on that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957828" data-originallang="fr">That said, no one is able to give me an answer. How is it that Israel has not yet set up this humanitarian corridor? I have had only one answer: It is because of Hamas.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957829" data-originallang="fr">With international pressure, with the parties that are all in agreement here tonight, with the 338 parliamentarians who agree with establishing such a humanitarian corridor, I think we can agree that Israel must absolutely take action and quickly.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957830" data-originallang="fr">What does my colleague think?</p>
