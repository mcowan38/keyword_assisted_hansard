<p data-HoCid="8776393" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8776394" data-originallang="en">I wish to move the following motion:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8776395" data-originallang="en"> Pursuant to Standing Order 108(2), given that Canadians continue to be affected by the geopolitical impacts of the October 7, 2023 attack by Hamas on Israel, and given that recent court filings have revealed disturbing details about a thwarted ISIS-linked bomb plot targeting Jewish Canadians on Parliament Hill, and given that an antisemitic riot occurred in Montreal on November 22, 2024, the committee immediately prioritize a study to run concurrently with the study on border security agreed to on Thursday, November 21, 2024, to investigate the dramatic rise in terrorist plots and acts of violence targeting Canada's Jewish community, including the thwarted terror attack on Parliament Hill; that the study be comprised of no fewer than eight meetings; and that the committee invite </p>
<p data-HoCid="8776396" data-originallang="en"> 1. the Minister of Public Safety and the Minister of Immigration on the matter of the motion passed on Thursday, September 19, 2024; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8776397" data-originallang="en"> 2. the special adviser to the Prime Minister on Jewish community relations and antisemitism; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8776398" data-originallang="en"> 3. the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, or RCMP, commissioner; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8776399" data-originallang="en"> 4. Brigitte Gauvin, the RCMP deputy commissioner for national security; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8776400" data-originallang="en"> 5. representatives of the RCMP's federal policing integrated national security enforcement team; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8776401" data-originallang="en"> 6. Robert Burley, executive director of the Canada Centre for Community Engagement and Prevention of Violence; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8776402" data-originallang="en"> 7. the director of Canadian Security and Intelligence Service and other law enforcement officials; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8776403" data-originallang="en"> 8. the director of the Parliamentary Protective Service; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8776404" data-originallang="en"> 9. recognized experts in national security; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8776405" data-originallang="en"> 10. representatives from TikTok, X, Snapchat, Discord, Reddit, Facebook, Telegram, Minecraft and Roblox; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8776406" data-originallang="en"> 11. civil society and academic organizations, including the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs and B'nai Brith, </p>
<p data-HoCid="8776407" data-originallang="en"> to discuss the foiled terrorist plot, the rise of violent antisemitism and recent measures the federal government has undertaken to address it, and the role that social media and gaming platforms play in radicalizing youth and mobilizing violence; that the committee report its findings and recommendations to the House; and, pursuant to Standing Order 109, that the government table a comprehensive response to the report. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8776408" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, as you know, Conservatives have made multiple attempts to bring forward a motion. We want to bring forward this one in this format. It considers what Ms. Damoff put forward and includes a number of witnesses we know are important to Liberal members. It seems there is an interest among all parties to study this, although I want to make the point that anti-Semitism has to be the focus of this study. If we look at what the Jewish community has faced over the past 13 months, I'm sure the committee would agree. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8776409" data-originallang="en">Certainly, there was a 109% increase in anti-Semitic incidents in 2023 compared with the previous year. In the most recent data available, there were nearly 6,000 documented acts of violence, harassment and vandalism aimed at Jews in Canada in 2023. In 2024, 66% of hate crimes with religion as a motivation were targeted at Jewish Canadians. Again, Jewish Canadians make up only 1% of all of Canada's population. It's incredibly significant. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8776410" data-originallang="en">There were 16 anti-Semitic incidents occurring every single day for the data available in 2023. As we know, in November 2023, two Jewish institutions in Montreal were firebombed exactly one month after the October 7 attacks in Israel. Also in November 2023, two Jewish schools were shot up with gunfire. Notably, these were an elementary and a kindergarten school. Then, twice in 2024, a Jewish girls' school in North York was subjected to gunfire. In May 2024, there was an arson attack on a synagogue. We know that synagogues have, by and large, across the country, experienced an increase in vandalism. In August 2024, across Canada, 100 Jewish institutions received bomb threats. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8776411" data-originallang="en">We know at this committee, certainly, that there have been multiple thwarted terrorist plots to massacre Jewish people, notably on Parliament Hill. We recently found out that, in December 2023, two teens were plotting to bomb Parliament Hill. Again, it's the heart of our democracy. There were a number of people from the Jewish community there, and a number of members of Parliament from all parties. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8776412" data-originallang="en">We also heard at this committee about the individual with a student visa who was en route to Brooklyn, New York earlier this fall to commit a massacre against Jewish people. We also heard reports and concerns about the father-son duo planning to make an attack in Toronto this past summer. They may have been targeting the Jewish community. There were multiple thwarted terrorist attacks on the Jewish community. Of course, we have all seen the protests targeting Jewish businesses and elderly care homes. Most recently, there were riots in Montreal at which someone called for the final solution for the Jewish people. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8776413" data-originallang="en">I want to conclude my remarks, Mr. Chair, with this: We are considering a lot of important matters at this committee. There are a lot of competing interests, but I think it's very evident that the Jewish community has faced something in the past 13 months that few of us can understand unless we're Jewish.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8776414" data-originallang="en"> The trauma from October 7 is felt continuously, particularly by women in the Jewish community in Canada. Ultimately, I do feel that the Jewish community feels that they've been abandoned both by their government and by others. I think it's an important signal for the committee of public safety and national security to send to the Jewish community that we have their backs, that we're going to take this seriously and that we're going to study this and really send a signal that we care about this and are taking it seriously as a committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8776415" data-originallang="en"> I'll just conclude by saying that I believe we have four more meetings on India. I know we're starting Ms. Michaud's study as well, so, as I mentioned, I would ask, Mr. Chair, that we concurrently look at that with this study and that we at least have one meeting on this before the holidays. I think that would send the right signal to the Jewish community and those who wish to harm them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8776416" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair. </p>
