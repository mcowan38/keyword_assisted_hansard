<p data-HoCid="8451237" data-originallang="en"> I simply want to add that we've been waiting for quite some time for the anti-racism strategy to be presented. That has not been the case. I think it's pretty clear that this is problematic, especially given the rise of hate in our country in terms of anti-Palestinian racism, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. I don't think it's acceptable to wait until this strategy that we've been waiting for for quite some time to come out. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8451238" data-originallang="en">As I've indicated, I'm very concerned that a number of advocates and stakeholders, including Palestinian Canadians, have concerns that anti-Palestinian racism is not being considered as part of the strategy. We want to get to the bottom of that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8451239" data-originallang="en">Obviously, we're now dealing with a truncated motion that doesn't mention anti-Palestinian racism or anti-Semitism. Certainly my intent in presenting this motion was to have a vote and hear from the minister, and, frankly, for us as a committee to share thoughts on our end. If Liberals and Conservatives don't want to support that, or the Bloc—whoever—then I say let's put it to a vote as it is now. </p>
