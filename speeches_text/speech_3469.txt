<p data-HoCid="8196851" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, let us recap the situation with the Canada emergency business account.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8196852" data-originallang="fr">According to current numbers from the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, nearly 150,000 businesses were unable to pay back their loan and nearly 200,000 others had to go into debt to do so. In addition to all that, roughly 50,000 business owners are still looking for refinancing. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8196853" data-originallang="fr">The federal government has the means to properly assess the situation and ensure the fewest bankruptcies possible. Specifically, it should look at the SME files on a case-by-case basis and show some flexibility. That is what we have been calling for from day one.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8196854" data-originallang="fr">Why is it still refusing to do so?</p>
