<p data-HoCid="6618135" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, it is my privilege today to rise virtually in the House of Commons to speak to Bill <a data-HoCid="11003629" href="/bills/43-2/C-14/" title="An Act to implement certain provisions of the economic statement tabled in Parliament on November 30, 2020 and other measures">C-14</a>, which enacts certain fiscal components of the fall fiscal update.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6618136" data-originallang="en">I want to begin by speaking about some of the advantages of the bill. Steps like raising the Canada child benefit are essential to maintaining gender equality during this pandemic. When lockdowns happened, it has been very difficult for women to find child care for their children. It is clear that the pandemic has disproportionately affected women.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6618137" data-originallang="en">There is no doubt the relief for student loans will help students. As our students graduate and struggle to find jobs, it is clear that they, too, have been deeply affected by the pandemic and by the high employment rates that have come with it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6618138" data-originallang="en">We have also continued to call for changes to the rent subsidy program, some of which has been included in Bill <a data-HoCid="11003629" href="/bills/43-2/C-14/" title="An Act to implement certain provisions of the economic statement tabled in Parliament on November 30, 2020 and other measures">C-14</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6618139" data-originallang="en">While the legislation does make some important changes, in many ways it also misses the mark. While a certain amount of spending and investment can be expected, and actually encouraged during these times, Bill <a data-HoCid="11003629" href="/bills/43-2/C-14/" title="An Act to implement certain provisions of the economic statement tabled in Parliament on November 30, 2020 and other measures">C-14</a> would give the government unfettered power to put Canada in a precarious situation. It would give the government the power of borrowing without the appropriate accountability and oversight.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6618140" data-originallang="en">The fact of the matter is that the COVID pandemic is far from over. In fact, Canada just reached an ominous milestone. For the first time in the global pandemic, Canada has reported more new COVID-19 cases per capita than the United States of America. How is this possible? How is it that many countries across the world are beginning to reopen their economies, beginning a new normal, while we hit a third wave that seems to be even worse than the ones that preceded it?</p>
<p data-HoCid="6618141" data-originallang="en">The answer is simple. We do not have enough vaccines. The procurement efforts have been botched and have been a failure. It has come with a deadly cost to Canadians. Whereas our counterparts in the U.S., UK and Israel are beginning to reopen, across Canada, we are re-entering devastating lockdowns.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6618142" data-originallang="en">It is with great sadness that I speak about the devastating impact this has had on our people. Many Canadians, including those in my riding of Northumberland—Peterborough South, have been forced to shut down for the better part of a year. According to Stats Canada, 60% of businesses reported a drop in revenue between 2020 and 2019, with certain industries being affected harder than others.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6618143" data-originallang="en">My riding of Northumberland—Peterborough South is home to some of the most beautiful landscapes and some of the most charming small towns in all of Ontario. Because of this, many of my constituents rely heavily on the tourism sector to survive and thrive. The hospitality, tourism sector, unfortunately, has been one of the hardest hit in Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6618144" data-originallang="en"> New statistics are now suggesting that 50% of Canadians are on the brink of insolvency. As we face more lockdowns, many Canadians are barely holding on and are continuing to rely on federal stimulus, like the CERB and CRB. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6618145" data-originallang="en">Mark Rosen, chair of the Canadian Association of Insolvency and Restructuring Professionals, recently had this to say.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6618146" data-originallang="en">I am having trouble speaking, Madam Speaker, due to a member not having his mute on.</p>
