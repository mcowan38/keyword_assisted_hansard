<p data-HoCid="7987560" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, last week, I asked the <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">Minister of Immigration</a> if he would expedite existing immigration applications to help get families out of Gaza. He said he had instructed his officials to be as flexible as possible, yet Global Affairs is telling people outright that only immediate family members are eligible and that parents and siblings are excluded. Clearly, the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing. Will the Minister of Immigration officially commit to expediting existing immigration applications and including extended family members?</p>
