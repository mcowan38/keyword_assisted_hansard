They're putting a lot of money behind solving those with specific targets that they want to hit. For all the U.S. energy, it's going to be geothermal and solar and wind.</p>

There are a lot of different things that we're excelling on. Looking at your idea from Israel and Finland, are they doing some of that? Is that a direction you think we should be taking for more of that commercialization?</p>
