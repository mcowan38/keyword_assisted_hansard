<p data-HoCid="6791775" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6791776" data-originallang="en">Thank you to our officials for being here. Thank you for the hard work you do on behalf of Canadians and for making yourselves available to the committee today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791777" data-originallang="en">Let me start with this. I am an Israeli Canadian citizen. I lived in Israel during the second intifada. I have been witness to, and unfortunately present at, terrorist bombings. It's an indescribable and awful experience. It's hard for Canadians to relate to it from here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791778" data-originallang="en">During the recent conflict, I had family huddling in bomb shelters. I know the stress of worrying for their safety. Is everyone from Canada's mission staff in Israel all right? Is their mental health okay? Is support available to them during this time?</p>
