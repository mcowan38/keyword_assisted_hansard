<p data-HoCid="8692001" data-originallang="en"> Look for an opportunity to pretend to Canadians that they give a damn about victims and are moving the needle when it comes to victim rights and ensuring the safety of victims generally. In particular, in this case, it's children, the most vulnerable members of our society, who often fall prey to individuals who would harm them in the most vile and disgusting ways. That should be the focus. That should have been the substance of Mr. Maloney's tweet, but, no, Mr. Maloney's true inner voice came out. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8692002" data-originallang="en">Because I have such respect for Mr. Maloney, I don't think that was an original thought, and I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt, because I have no doubt in my mind that Justin Trudeau and his cabal at the PMO directed Mr. Maloney as the lead at justice. My friend Mr. Mendicino is smiling. I have no doubt that the cabal at the PMO directed and telegraphed the content of that tweet to somehow weave in that little wedge issue that comes back time after time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8692003" data-originallang="en">This is notwithstanding the fact that the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada yesterday in question period talked about the Conservative position as being the same Conservative position that has been on the table for the last two decades. It goes in one ear and out the other with respect to this Liberal government, because, “In case of emergency, break glass.” </p>
<p data-HoCid="8692004" data-originallang="en"> I too want to get to the point where we're studying this, but I'm also deeply, deeply disappointed in Ms. Dabrusin, Mr. Mendicino and Mr. Housefather, all three of whom, again, I have a great deal of respect for. These individuals, Madam Chair, were hand-picked by Justin Trudeau and the PMO to sit on this anti-Semitism study. </p>
