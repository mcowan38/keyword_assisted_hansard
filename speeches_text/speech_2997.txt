<p data-HoCid="8019348" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8019349" data-originallang="fr">I would like to ask a question that is more or less related to today's topic, but that has been bothering me for a while now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8019350" data-originallang="fr">A year ago, at the beginning of the war in Ukraine, the subcommittee received a visit from Mr. Grandi, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Mr. Grandi came to tell us that, in his opinion, the war in Ukraine was having a major impact on all refugee crises around the world. He said that all the governments and media outlets were concentrating solely on Ukraine, and that this had repercussions on other crises and other needs that might exist around the world.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8019351" data-originallang="fr">My question is for Ms. Aivazovska and Mr. Mikheiev. Are the events in Israel and Palestine over the past three weeks having an impact on your conflict, because the world lens is less focused on Ukraine right now and is turned towards Palestine? Does this have an impact on the ground and on the involvement of governments in the war, in one way or another? Can any of you answer that question?</p>
