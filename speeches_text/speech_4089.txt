<p data-HoCid="8406066" data-originallang="fr">Ms. Nashen, in your opinion, do we need to make a distinction among the Canadian Jewish community, the Jewish community in Israel, the Jewish community around the world and the Israeli government, which a number of us are criticizing? Is there a distinction, or should everyone be lumped together, in your opinion?</p>
