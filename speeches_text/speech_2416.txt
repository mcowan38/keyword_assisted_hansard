<p data-HoCid="7846164" data-originallang="en"> Good afternoon.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7846165" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair, for the opportunity to speak today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7846166" data-originallang="en">My comments are informed by an investigation into Paper Excellence, which Greenpeace Canada and our partners released in October and which is available online.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7846167" data-originallang="en">Our investigation into Paper Excellence's corporate structure uncovered a network of holding companies registered in offshore jurisdictions characterized by high levels of secrecy. Other than its Domtar holdings, its Canadian mills are primarily owned by Paper Excellence Canada Holdings Corporation, incorporated in Canada in 2010. The corporation is itself owned by Paper Excellence B.V., registered in the Netherlands. The owner of Paper Excellence B.V. is Fortune Everrich, registered in Malaysia. Fortune Everrich is owned by yet another Malaysian company, Capital Assets Holdings, registered in an offshore financial centre. At the end of this rabbit hole is Elite Shine Investments Limited, registered in the British Virgin Islands, which is Paper Excellence Canada Holdings Corporation's ultimate owner. Domtar is now owned by holding companies in the Netherlands and Hong Kong.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7846168" data-originallang="en">Paper Excellence represents itself as a Canadian company and denies being a subsidiary of Asia Pulp &amp; Paper or Sinar Mas. However, our investigation revealed family ties, overlapping management and lobbyist filings, indicating that Sinar Mas, in fact, controls Paper Excellence. APP and Paper Excellence can thus be considered sister companies under Sinar Mas. In B.C., lobbyist Moe Sihota registered for Paper Excellence in 2020. In his public filing, he disclosed Sinar Mas as an affiliate with “a direct interest in the outcome of the lobbying”. After Paper Excellence bought the Meadow Lake mill in Saskatchewan, it wrote at least six letters to the province on letterhead stating it was “A Division of Sinarmas Group”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7846169" data-originallang="en">Most significantly, Paper Excellence maintains it is solely owned by Jackson Wijaya, the son of Sinar Mas and APP boss Teguh Wijaya. Who exactly is Jackson Wijaya? Is he an owner we never see who lives in Shanghai or Jakarta, or is “Jackson” a code word for the financial interests of a family that owns a global logging empire? Paper Excellence's own SEC filings suggest it's the latter:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7846170" data-originallang="en"> “Jackson Wijaya” means (a) Jackson Wijaya, (b) family members of Jackson Wijaya, (c) trusts, partnerships or limited liability companies for the benefit of any of the individuals identified in the foregoing clause (a) or (b)— </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7846171" data-originallang="en">It continues.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7846172" data-originallang="en">What exactly is Asia Pulp &amp; Paper's track record?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7846173" data-originallang="en">In Indonesia, APP and its suppliers have deforested over two million hectares of rainforest, including Sumatran tiger and orangutan habitat. Many of its suppliers have conflicts with indigenous communities over land use. Its plantations, which drain carbon-rich peatlands, have been linked to catastrophic fires and massive greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7846174" data-originallang="en">In Canada, the government says Paper Excellence will comply with federal and provincial laws. However, in Ontario, the logging industry is exempt from the Endangered Species Act, so that won't do much good. British Columbia still hasn't passed endangered species legislation, while Quebec drags its heels on protections for woodland caribou. A recent peer-reviewed study of shortcomings in federal law to protect biodiversity concluded that “biodiversity loss within Canada...suggest[s]...transformative change is needed.” Thanks to these weak laws, which the government says Paper Excellence will comply with, forests are already in crisis across the country, with collapsing caribou populations, growing emissions and historic protests. Paper Excellence might market itself as a saviour, but I see a vulture picking struggling forests clean to feed a global empire for the benefit of very few.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7846175" data-originallang="en">The corporate firewalls between Paper Excellence entities present an enormous obstacle to the Canadian public in holding it accountable for its actions, environmental impacts and social commitments. Instead of meekly accepting Paper Excellence's assurances, this calls for coordinated action led by the federal government, focusing on two key areas: first, much greater transparency in the logging industry so we all know exactly who is logging, how it's being done and who is profiting; and, second, much more effective forest regulations to ensure wildlife is being protected, indigenous rights are respected and local communities are benefiting. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7846176" data-originallang="en">With Paper Excellence in town, these measures are more urgent than ever.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7846177" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
