<p data-HoCid="6169393" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, of course, and I said so during my speech. I do not think that you can pick and choose when it comes to human rights. You cannot defend the rights of the people of Hong Kong and then deny fundamental rights to Palestinians, as is currently being done by Israel. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6169394" data-originallang="fr">It is particularly concerning that we are now talking about a bill brought in by the People's Republic of China on domestic security that will also have an impact on Hong Kong. However, at nearly the same time, the Government of Israel has a plan to annex settlements in the Jordan Valley and areas north of the Dead Sea.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6169395" data-originallang="fr">Earlier a Conservative colleague said that it was the Palestinians' fault that they were under Israeli occupation. Comments like that are completely unacceptable. Human rights are being violated, and we must protect human rights everywhere.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6169396" data-originallang="fr">I hear some people saying that the Bloc Québécois foreign affairs critic has taken an anti-Israel stance. That is not at all the case. We completely agree with a solution that would preserve peace and security in the region. However, we know that, if Israel annexes new territories, the possibility of lasting peace and security for Israel and Palestine will be even more remote. We therefore need to work to promote peace, and that goal will not be achieved through Israel's annexation of territories that do not belong to it. </p>
