<p data-HoCid="7993688" data-originallang="fr">It's a request for clarification, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7993689" data-originallang="fr">My colleague Mr. Waugh says that his subamendment begins at the fourth point. However, when I read the third point, which talks about the conflict between Israel and Hamas, Mr. Julian's amendment referred to Meta platforms. I'm wondering if Mr. Waugh is keeping the words “on Meta platforms” in his subamendment.</p>
