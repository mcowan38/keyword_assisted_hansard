<p data-HoCid="7958985" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, before I begin my remarks, I want to turn my attention to the people of Gaza and Israel. I think we have to set both organizations aside and focus on the people themselves. My thoughts are with them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7958986" data-originallang="fr">I want to thank my colleague from Battlefords—Lloydminster, who gave an excellent speech.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7958987" data-originallang="fr">I rise this afternoon to speak to an official opposition motion. I believe it is the role of the official opposition to call on the government to be more diligent and responsible and to deliver concrete results for Canadians. I will quote the different parts of the motion because that is what we are debating, and I think people who are watching at home on the House of Commons network deserve to know what we are talking about.</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7958988" data-originallang="fr"> (i) after eight years of this Liberal government, this prime minister has added more to the national debt than all previous prime minister's combined, </p>
<p data-HoCid="7958989" data-originallang="fr"> (ii) a half-trillion dollars of inflationary deficits has directly led to 40-year inflation highs, </p>
<p data-HoCid="7958990" data-originallang="fr"> (iii) prior to budget 2023, the Minister of Finance said, “What Canadians want right now is for inflation to come down and for interest rates to fall […] </p>

<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7958992" data-originallang="fr"> …and that is one of our primary goals in this year's budget: not to pour fuel on the fire of inflation,” and then proceed to usher in $60 billion in new spending, </p>
<p data-HoCid="7958993" data-originallang="fr"> (iv) in order to combat inflation, the Bank of Canada has been forced to increase interest rates 10 times in just 19 months, </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7958994" data-originallang="fr">There is a problem somewhere, but the Liberals do not seem to want to acknowledge it.</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7958995" data-originallang="fr"> (v) interest rate increases have increased mortgage payments, and since this prime minister took office, monthly mortgage payments have increased 150% and now cost $3,500 on a typical family home... </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7958996" data-originallang="fr">Then it mentions the Liberal-NDP government, because it is important to understand that this is a minority government and that, if this government is kept in power, it is because there is a coalition. The NDP and the Liberal Party are committed to keeping this government in office, despite the fact that it is not delivering results and Canadians are paying the price. Therefore:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7958997" data-originallang="fr"> (vi) the Liberal-NDP government must exercise fiscal discipline, end their inflation driving deficits so that interest rates can be lowered, </p>
