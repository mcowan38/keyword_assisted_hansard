<p data-HoCid="8453740" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8453741" data-originallang="en">I would like to start by acknowledging that we are meeting on the traditional and unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinabe people here in Ottawa.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8453742" data-originallang="en">Thank you for inviting me back to discuss the immigration measures my department has introduced in response to the humanitarian crises in both Gaza and Sudan.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8453743" data-originallang="en">Let me start by speaking on the devastating situation in Gaza. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8453744" data-originallang="en">As you're aware, conditions there are changing drastically day by day, making our efforts both more urgent and more challenging. The biggest challenge continues to be what Canada does not control, which is in particular who can exit the Gaza Strip and when. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8453745" data-originallang="en">Under the special immigration measures we implemented in January for extended family in Gaza, once an applicant exits Gaza, they will complete their biometrics screening in Egypt before being issued a temporary resident visa.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8453746" data-originallang="en">There is no questioning the anguish and frustration that Palestinians in Canada and indeed around the world are feeling as they wait tirelessly for their family members and families to be safe. I want to make it clear to family members that Canada continues to put in every effort on every level to facilitate the safe exit of their loved ones. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8453747" data-originallang="en">While we have been limited in our success, it is certainly not for lack of trying. We won't give up on bringing family members to safety.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8453748" data-originallang="fr">Canada continues to put forward the names of applicants who passed our preliminary screening to local authorities. Israel and Egypt are both important partners in implementing these temporary humanitarian measures. We are working closely with both governments to facilitate the exit of extended family members and advocate for their safety. We are also continuing to process applications from those who were able to leave without our assistance.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8453749" data-originallang="fr">Given the many Canadians and permanent residents seeking to help their extended family in Gaza, I would like to announce that we have increased the number of temporary resident visa applications that will be accepted into processing—from 1,000 to 5,000.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8453750" data-originallang="en"> The work has been done and continues to be done, but has been done over the past few weeks to that end. We've been issuing more client codes in anticipation of this so that people can apply for those temporary resident visas.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8453751" data-originallang="en"> As the border is currently closed, movement out of Gaza is not possible. However, the situation may change at any time, and with this cap increase we'll be ready to help more people.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8453752" data-originallang="en">We have also confirmed that those in Gaza who already possess a valid temporary resident or super visa can identify themselves to us through our crisis web form if they need our help to exit. This process can also be used by those outside Gaza to get our help in finalizing their applications to come to Canada, whether it's part of our special measures or on a regular visa. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8453753" data-originallang="en">Regarding Sudan, we've been working to welcome those impacted by the conflict when it first broke out a year ago. These efforts include Sudanese and non-Sudanese nationals alike in all immigration categories.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8453754" data-originallang="fr">Over the past year, we’ve welcomed more than 4,000 people from Sudan as permanent residents and 1,500 as temporary residents.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8453755" data-originallang="fr">In February, we introduced a new, temporary family-based humanitarian pathway to permanent residence for those who fled the conflict and may now come to Canada to be with their extended family. This program will enable Canada to help even more people from Sudan. We may well have filled the spaces currently available.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8453756" data-originallang="en"> For those already in Canada, we are waiving fees and extending certain exemptions to support them in applying for new study or work permits, extending their existing temporary status or becoming a permanent resident under the family class. These measures are available until October 27, 2024 to align with the expiry of similar measures for Sudanese nationals in Canada as temporary residents.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8453757" data-originallang="fr">In keeping with our long-standing tradition, Canada is also welcoming people from Sudan as government-assisted and privately sponsored refugees. Almost one thousand refugees were approved to come to Canada in the past year. We’re working with our partners to expedite all arrivals to Canada under our special measures.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8453758" data-originallang="en">We will continue to focus on keeping families together and bringing them to safety as quickly as we can.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8453759" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8453760" data-originallang="en">I'm happy to take any and all questions.</p>
