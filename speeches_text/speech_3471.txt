<p data-HoCid="8196948" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, it is an important question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8196949" data-originallang="en">What is happening in Gaza is a complete tragedy. Netanyahu's military operation in Rafah is devastating Palestinians and others who are seeking shelter. Gazans have nowhere else to go, and as the minister said, asking them to move again is totally unacceptable.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8196950" data-originallang="en">This violence must stop. We must have a sustainable peace. Hostages must be returned, and we must find a way forward to get humanitarian assistance to the people who need it the most.</p>
