<p data-HoCid="7971381" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, we unequivocally condemn Hamas's terrorist attack against Israel. We support Israel's right to defend itself in accordance with international law.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7971382" data-originallang="en">We are deeply concerned about the situation in Gaza. As I said, there are ongoing diplomatic conversations about the consideration of humanitarian pauses, and that is something Canada supports.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7971383" data-originallang="en">Desperately needed humanitarian aid must reach vulnerable Palestinian civilians in Gaza, and Canada is working closely with partners to build a humanitarian corridor. Hamas must immediately release all hostages, and Canadians and foreign nationals who wish to leave Gaza must be allowed to do so.</p>
