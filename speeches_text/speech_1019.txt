<p data-HoCid="6784485" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6784486" data-originallang="en">Again, I'd like to thank both of the witnesses for coming today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6784487" data-originallang="en">Mr. Gurski, what would your expert opinion be on the threshold for determining if something rises to being terrorism? It appears that there's a great deal of overlap between what could be religious extremism, in motivated attacks, for example, against the Jewish community, but those could also be xenophobic IMVE, by this study's definition. Similarly, anarchy is a political system defined by the absence of a government. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6784488" data-originallang="en">How do you differentiate from political extremism when it comes to anti-authority violence, and is there any differentiation between these groups?</p>
