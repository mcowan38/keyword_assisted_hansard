<p data-HoCid="8391515" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8391516" data-originallang="en">I just want to be clear. What I am suggesting is that instead of firing amendments back and forth, instead of playing the game of battling motions, let's sit down properly as a group, all of us. This is my request. It is my offer.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8391517" data-originallang="en"> I would ask Mrs. Thomas to withdraw her motion in its current form, and I would say, “Why don't we sit together, all of us?” It isn't just a question of York University. This is a question of people in my community and others, people who are walking down the street, who are worried about sending their kids to the Jewish day school in my riding. This is a serious issue. If we are serious about doing this and about not having a partisan game, let's go in camera, all of us. Let's come up with a motion that can be supported unanimously. Please, let us take this seriously. I don't want this to be a political game for any community in this country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8391518" data-originallang="en">We have serious issues related to hate, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism and anti-Black racism. These are all issues that we should rightly be working together to fight.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8391519" data-originallang="en">In the case of this conversation about anti-Semitism, Mr. Chair, my sincere request is that we actually do the right thing here—and I have a track record that I am proud to stand on in working with the Jewish community in my riding and others. Let's sit together without cameras, without the show of theatre, and come up with something together that would send an unequivocal message to the Jewish community in this country and to all communities that none of us have daylight between us when it comes to the fight against anti-Semitism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8391520" data-originallang="en">There are too many things in this world that people in this country are being held to account for. There is nothing reasonable about holding Jews in Canada responsible for what is happening in Israel and in Gaza any more than it was right for people to look at me as a Muslim and tell me that my people are responsible for 9/11. I grew up in an era, Mr. Chair, when Muslims were looked at because of 9/11 and were told that they were responsible for what happened.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8391521" data-originallang="en"> To this day, the number of comments that I get on my Twitter about <em>taqiyya</em> Tuesday, about people saying that I was a member of al Qaeda, that I was a member of this, that I am the Hamas troop and brigade.... These are things that are serious, and they were in response, Mr. Chair, to the tweet that Mrs. Thomas put up the other day.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8391522" data-originallang="en"> So I get it. I know what it means when communities are vilified by what happens a world away. I get it. I have lived it. I live it. My family has lived it. It is not okay. It is not okay for Jews in this country to pay the price for what happened or what is happening in Gaza. It is not okay for people to assume that all Muslims somehow support Hamas. These are things that are fundamentally wrong, so my plea, sincerely, to every member of this committee is that we sit down together. Let's start with a blank piece of paper, all of us, if we truly care about this issue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8391523" data-originallang="en"> Mrs. Thomas spends a lot of time saying that she cares about the Jewish community. That's wonderful. That's important, and she should. We all should, but then let's take this seriously. I am reaching my hand out to ask every member of this committee that we sit down in a room together. Let us craft language that is unequivocal in its condemnation of anti-Semitism. Let's do that. Let's send a message that protest is fine, that anti-Semitism is not. Let's send a message that says that fighting for things that we care about is right but that glorifying violence is not. Let's send a message out there that says that no innocent life should be lost in vain, that there should be condemnation of all loss of innocent life. These are things that we all should be able to do.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8391524" data-originallang="en"> My question is this: Is every member of this committee willing to sit down and turn off the cameras, turn off the social media; to sit together and work like grown-ups, like the people that we are, like the grown-ups that I believe our constituents elected, to come together and actually get something done?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8391525" data-originallang="en"> If that is the will of this committee, if that is the commitment that we are prepared to make—for once to put partisanship aside, to put the cheap political points aside, to say, “Let's start with a blank piece of paper”, and we—</p>
