<p data-HoCid="8350223" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair. Those were three excellent testimonies. There is so much here to unpack.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8350224" data-originallang="en">Mr. Black, I will start with you and the big picture. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8350225" data-originallang="en">The U.S. is Canada's most strategic partner across a whole host of things. The statement that came out from the recent G7 meeting in November actually talked about Africa being in seventh place after Ukraine, and I won't take the time to list them all.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8350226" data-originallang="en">Is that where Africa should be, from Canada's position? Given the Indo-Pacific, given the south Caucasus, given Ukraine, given Gaza, where should Africa be in Canada's priority?</p>
