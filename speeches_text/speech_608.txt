<p data-HoCid="6502918" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the most difficult medication to buy is the one that is not available in Canada. It is the one someone finds out about after going to their doctor and being told that it is in the United States, and if they were an American citizen, they could get access to it. However, since they are a Canadian, they cannot. That is the news that too often happens to patients with rare diseases and to their families. My family is one of those families. The families dealing with cystic fibrosis, with SMA and with cystinosis are other ones. The list goes on and on.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6502919" data-originallang="en">Bill <a data-HoCid="10866059" href="/bills/43-2/C-213/" title="An Act to enact the Canada Pharmacare Act">C-213</a> is a solution looking to address the wrong problem. The problem is access, and access is what I want to talk about this evening. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6502920" data-originallang="en">I have gone through the speech by the member for <a data-HoCid="252953" href="/politicians/peter-julian/" title="Peter Julian">New Westminster—Burnaby</a>. My colleagues from <a data-HoCid="252813" href="/politicians/michelle-rempel/" title="Michelle Rempel">Calgary Nose Hill</a> and <a data-HoCid="252595" href="/politicians/marilyn-gladu/" title="Marilyn Gladu">Sarnia—Lambton</a> went over a lot of territory in pointing out what is wrong with this particular piece of legislation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6502921" data-originallang="en">The legislation is trying to address the wrong problem. I want to demonstrate that by sharing some of the issues I have with what the member for <a data-HoCid="252953" href="/politicians/peter-julian/" title="Peter Julian">New Westminster—Burnaby</a> said and address them piece by piece to demonstrate why this is the wrong bill.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6502922" data-originallang="en">It does not achieve any goals. The goal should be to provide access to patients in Canada through greater choice in drugs, drugs that will actually ensure they get over their condition or that will provide a therapy that reduces their symptoms, instead of looking at their American counterparts, citizens of America. Some of them are dual citizens, and they, for example, can have access to that medication when they go to the United States, but they cannot access it here in Canada unless they are one of the very few who have a special access program for it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6502923" data-originallang="en">One of the NDP members mentioned that currently in Canada we have a patchwork of provincial systems. We know that in Canada, 90% to 98% of Canadians have access to some type of either private or public insurance. In fact, nearly all the provinces have a public insurer. In Alberta, it is the Alberta Blue Cross that people can get access to.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6502924" data-originallang="en">Two provinces that I am aware of have already said they will not participate in national pharmacare. In November of 2019, Alberta finance minister Travis Toews sent a letter to the federal government indicating that the provincial government, the Government of Alberta, would not participate in national pharmacare. It will want an opt-out. Members for the Bloc have said that their provincial government will not participate either. What will happen? We will have a patchwork system again. Again, because this bill does not consult with anybody or ask the provinces what they are thinking or recognize that it is in the jurisdiction of provinces, it does not achieve any of the goals.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6502925" data-originallang="en">Speaking of access, the Ontario government, the previous government, took a bunch of people and put them onto OHIP+. It transferred 2.1 million Ontarians who already had private plans onto a public plan at a higher cost, a plan that provided worse coverage than what they had before. I had many people explain their particular situation. They liked their private plan.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6502926" data-originallang="en">When a survey is done to ask people if they like the private plan they are on or the public plan they are on, most Canadians, by a wide majority, say that they do like the plan they are on. I agree that there are people who have difficulty paying for some of the copayments, but this bill does not address that. This bill proposes to centralize everything in Ottawa and then figure it out later. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6502927" data-originallang="en">I have come to believe, after five and a half years here in Ottawa, that when someone says they will figure it out later, it usually will cause harm to Canadians in the long term, especially if they are one of those one in 12 Canadians dealing with a rare disease. Many people have someone in their life who has a rare disease. I have three children with a rare disease. I had a daughter pass away from a different rare disease three years ago.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6502928" data-originallang="en">The problem in Canada, as I said, is being made worse by federal government action through the PMPRB. This problem will not be addressed through anything in this particular piece of legislation. This measure is coming forward because of a false belief that it could somehow artificially reduce the price of medication coming into the market in Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6502929" data-originallang="en">There is a PBO estimate that has been provided and repeated now by several members that the total spent on public health care will be reduced by $4 billion to $4.5 billion. They call it the universal discount. Actually, if we look at the data in the PBO report, 25% is completely random. This is one of the rare times when I disagree with the methodology used by the PBO. This 25% discount is already happening through the pCPA, the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance, which is used by the provinces to negotiate with manufacturers. They are basically assuming an extra 25% discount “just because”. I do not think that is the way statistics should be done and I disagree with the analysis.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6502930" data-originallang="en">In fact, one of the members on the NDP side then went on to quote New Zealand as a good example of how it had been able to reduce drug costs. What people in New Zealand do not want to have is a rare disease. There is very little access to rare disease medication or the latest and greatest most innovative drugs to address their condition. There are countless examples online of New Zealand citizens fleeing to other countries to obtain access to medication. New Zealand is the worst example anywhere in the world if people have a rare disease.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6502931" data-originallang="en">There is a Yiddish saying, “He who runs away from fire, falls into the water” and that is what is happening here. There is a problem and the solution that is being called upon is a centralization of all the plans in Canada to wipe out the architecture, the jobs, the system that many Canadians rely on and generally like. It is not perfect; there are issues with it. We are running into a system, we are going to fall into the water and drown. Things would be made worse by the changes being proposed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6502932" data-originallang="en">On the issue of PMPRB's costing, for example, we often talk about rare disease drug costs and how it puts a huge dent in provincial budgets. If we look at non-oncology drugs, 70% of what the PMPRB says is for rare disease medication is actually being used for secondary uses. Therefore, if people have a rare disease and there is a drug for, it is given by a doctor and it is used, but then there has to be a second, third or fourth usage. The medical system says that it can be used for those other purposes. That is being included in the final statistics. It is wrong to say that rare disease patients will cost the system more when in fact different types of medication are also used for other purposes or uses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6502933" data-originallang="en">According to the annual report of the PMPRB, the changes in the cost is 2.5% to 2.6%. I will credit the Canadian Forum for Rare Disease Innovators for these statistics and these points. It is very compelling evidence that the costs for rare diseases are not caused by rare disease patients. In fact, it is other uses for the same innovative medicine that is coming to Canada. To reiterate my point, the hardest medication to purchase in Canada is that which is not available in Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6502934" data-originallang="en">I want to take a moment to credit and thank Alberta Minister of Health, Tyler Shandro, for his January 17 interim agreement for Zolgensma, which is a groundbreaking, innovative medication for children with SMA type 1 spinal muscular atrophy, one of the most dangerous conditions that will kill children if they do not get access to a type of medication. This is the same minister who compassionately approved and ensured there was access in Alberta quickly for Spinraza, three weeks after he was named minister. I told him I would hound him until he made it happen. To his credit, he did, and compassionately years later he ensured there was access to Zolgensma for children under age 18 in Alberta. I do not believe a national pharmacare minister like that could act as quickly as a provincial minister could acct when he feels the pressure from constituents, residents and elected officials.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6502935" data-originallang="en">We have Cystinosis, examples of cystic fibrosis, and Trikafta and Orkambi. There is groundbreaking medication out there being made available to people living in other countries that is not available here. The bill would not fix any of those issues. There are other solutions to fill the gaps in place and I would love to discuss those solutions and look for ways to improve the system in different matters.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6502936" data-originallang="en">The member for <a data-HoCid="252813" href="/politicians/michelle-rempel/" title="Michelle Rempel">Calgary Nose Hill</a> brought up a few of them, so I will reiterate them. Common drugs are classified in different countries as over the counter. Australia does an amazing job of this as does the United Kingdom. We can look at what the public health spends on certain medications and maybe find a lower dose that could be available over the counter. Some antibiotics come to mind. Some estimates suggest that just three of those drugs could save $1 billion a year on drug spending.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6502937" data-originallang="en"> There are other things we could do to reduce the bureaucracy in the system. Too many Canadians are trapped between the CADTH approval and the pCPA reimbursement agreement.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6502938" data-originallang="en">What I care most about is access for patients with rare diseases. Bill <a data-HoCid="10866059" href="/bills/43-2/C-213/" title="An Act to enact the Canada Pharmacare Act">C-213</a> does not achieve any of those goals. I cannot support it.</p>
