<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Minister, for joining us today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">For me, spring means the start of the fishing season in my region. I see the crab and lobster fishing boats going by in Caraquet Bay in front of my house as they head offshore to get the season under way. For the past five years, we have been dealing with the challenge of protecting right whales, and I think that we did extremely well in that regard. We also need to acknowledge the amazing work done by the fishers themselves to modernize their fishing methods.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">Every year, we do our utmost to break up the ice in my region's ports, which is a bit problematic because as you know, the ice has been staying around a little longer. We experienced a few minor challenges this year in terms of the equipment we had been promised, but that's now been dealt with. I am even happy when I see the <em>Judy LaMarsh</em> icebreaker entering Caraquet Bay for the first time every year. </p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">Will we, once again this year, have a simultaneous fishing season, meaning when the crabbing season begins at the same time for everyone in all the provinces?</p>
