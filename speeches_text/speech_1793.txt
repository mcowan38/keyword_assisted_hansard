<p data-HoCid="7201781" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7201782" data-originallang="en">My question is to both ministers.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7201783" data-originallang="en">Here we are talking about violence against indigenous women and indigenous communities. We know that climate change is currently having a disproportionate and devastating impact on a number of indigenous communities, and that impact is felt most strongly by women as well across the board.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7201784" data-originallang="en">With that reality in mind, I have put forward a private member's Bill <a data-HoCid="11541161" href="/bills/44-1/C-245/" title="An Act to amend the Canada Infrastructure Bank Act">C-245</a>, seconded by my colleague, <a data-HoCid="281018" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Leah Gazan</a>, that shifts the foundations of the Canada Infrastructure Bank to focus on the desperate need for mitigation and adaptation infrastructure with a particular focus on indigenous and northern communities to deal with everything from devastating flooding and forest fires to melting ice roads. The reality of the climate emergency is already with us, and we need solution-based ways of dealing with this crisis.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7201785" data-originallang="en">My question to both of you is this. Given your responsibilities as ministers and your interest, both in terms of gender equality and putting an end to violence against women and lifting up indigenous communities, will you be supporting my Bill <a data-HoCid="11541161" href="/bills/44-1/C-245/" title="An Act to amend the Canada Infrastructure Bank Act">C-245</a>?</p>
