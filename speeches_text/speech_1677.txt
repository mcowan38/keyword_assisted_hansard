<p data-HoCid="7150131" data-originallang="en"> Thank you for having me.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7150132" data-originallang="en">My name is Tony McAleer. I'm the author of <em>The Cure for Hate: A Former White Supremacist's Journey from Violent Extremism to Radical Compassion</em>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7150133" data-originallang="en">I spent 15 years in the violent far right in Canada and the U.S. as a follower, a recruiter and a leader. I left that movement in 1998 and began a journey of transformation and healing that involved over 1,000 hours of individual and group counselling with a coach and mentor who, ironically, was Jewish.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7150134" data-originallang="en">In 2010, I decided to help others who were where I once was and co-founded the U.S.-based, non-profit called Life After Hate, which has helped over 700 people leave violent, far right extremist groups behind.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7150135" data-originallang="en">My experience of getting into and out of these organizations and ideologies has led me to consult and advise governments of all levels over three continents, including two prime ministers in Austria and New Zealand. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7150136" data-originallang="en">Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7150137" data-originallang="en">While the challenge of the rising tide of ideologically motivated violent extremism is nothing new, the speed at which ideas are spread and the recent trend of mass murders make this a dangerous global terrorist threat. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7150138" data-originallang="en">We remember Anders Breivik, murderer of 76 people in Norway; the Christchurch mosque massacre in New Zealand; the AME church in Charleston; the Oak Creek Sikh temple in Wisconsin; and the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7150139" data-originallang="en">Closer to home, the mosque shooting in Quebec City, the mass vehicular homicides in London and Toronto, the rise of anti-Asian attacks and assorted hate crimes against indigenous, Black and LGBTQ2S communities create a climate of fear that tears at the fabric of our society.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7150140" data-originallang="en">This is a complex problem that requires a thoughtful and nuanced response. Often well-meaning but expedient solutions can cause unintended consequences and be counterproductive. The responses fall into three main categories: technological, law enforcement and public health.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7150141" data-originallang="en">Technology is the arena in which these ideologies are spread, the Internet and social media. Again, this is a complex area, and great care must be exercised to set healthy limits to freedom of expression.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7150142" data-originallang="en">In the 1990s, I operated the Canadian Liberty Net, a computer-operated messaging system that contained anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant and Holocaust-denial messages that was subject to a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, an injunction and ultimately a trip to the Supreme Court of Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7150143" data-originallang="en">The more the hate line was suppressed, the more callers dialled in and were drawn into the world of intolerance. At its peak, it received 300 calls per day. The court proceedings became a powerful recruiting tool, an example of unintended consequences that has become known as the Streisand effect. Banning something makes it more popular.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7150144" data-originallang="en">Policy to tackle online hate should be carefully considered to avoid overreach and the appearance of politicization to avoid this effect.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7150145" data-originallang="en">On the Internet, content does not necessarily go away; it goes somewhere else. Content from large platforms gets pushed onto smaller platforms that often don't have the capacity to moderate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7150146" data-originallang="en">Of the two other main responses, law enforcement and public health, the latter has the greatest gaps and opportunities, and I will focus there.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7150147" data-originallang="en">By the time a person gets involved in violent extremism and appears on the radar of law enforcement, several opportunities have already been missed. While there's a growing network of providers, social workers, counsellors and psychologists, for example, for interventions, a more robust effort can be made to engage and train existing resources in the community to utilize their skill set in a way they hadn't considered by creating the opportunities to intervene further upstream, long before law enforcement becomes involved. Training school counsellors would be an example of this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7150148" data-originallang="en">Currently based on the number of conversations I've had with several municipalities, there seems to be almost no primary prevention. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7150149" data-originallang="en">Believe it or not, ideology is not the primary drive as to why people join these movements. Yes, it is a factor, but identity, belonging and a sense of meaning and purpose are far greater draws, according to research. The lack of these are the result of vulnerabilities that these movements exploit. The ideology is the pill one swallows to obtain these important drivers.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7150150" data-originallang="en">Research has shown that 15% of the general population has had two or more adverse childhood events: trauma, abandonment or neglect, for example. But of those in ideologically motivated violent extremism, 66% had four or more. Although trauma often creates the vulnerabilities, it's important to note that trauma is not a predictor. There is a whole host of anti-social outcomes, addiction, for example, that are possible from these vulnerabilities, of which violent extremism is but a small sliver and a very dangerous and harmful sliver, nonetheless. </p>
