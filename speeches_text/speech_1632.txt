<p data-HoCid="7105559" data-originallang="fr">Madam Speaker, let me begin by reading the text of a motion unanimously adopted by the National Assembly of Quebec on May 26, 2021, nearly a year ago: </p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7105560" data-originallang="fr"> That the National Assembly strongly condemn the threats, violence and aggression against Jewish Quebecers, which have increased in recent weeks; </p>
<p data-HoCid="7105561" data-originallang="fr"> That it reaffirm that in a free and democratic society, all people may protest or express their opinions in a context of respect, safety and dignity; </p>
<p data-HoCid="7105562" data-originallang="fr"> That it reiterate the need to continue to hold a healthy and democratic debate on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; </p>
<p data-HoCid="7105563" data-originallang="fr"> That, lastly, it recall that violence toward anyone is never acceptable. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7105564" data-originallang="fr">Those are the words of the National Assembly of Quebec. As far as I am concerned, it is the supreme authority in Quebec. The Bloc Québécois is committed to defending these unanimous motions and will continue to defend them against all attacks. I read that out to illustrate that Bill <a data-HoCid="11535416" href="/bills/44-1/C-250/">C-250</a> is part of that process. Bill C‑250 is not perfect, but it is part of that process. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7105565" data-originallang="fr">Hatred is a venom in the veins of society. Inciting and promoting hatred is akin to injecting this poison into the veins of our society.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7105566" data-originallang="fr">Quebec adopted a secularism law specifically to allow each and every religious faith to be practised voluntarily and freely, without the appearance of government criticism, favour or disapproval. We want the government to be secular, and we want people to be free to practise the religion of their choice. To us, in Quebec, this principle is sacred.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7105567" data-originallang="fr">Over the past few years, we have seen an increase in the number of anti-Semitic crimes. I saw that anti-Semitic crimes increased considerably in 2021, in the Montreal area in particular, but elsewhere as well, including the Vancouver area, as my colleague across the way mentioned, as well as in various parts of Canada and in the U.S. too, and probably throughout the western hemisphere. We have to work on not only reducing this disturbing trend, but stopping it in its tracks.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7105568" data-originallang="fr">Obviously, it is not just hatred against the Jewish community that we must combat, but all hatred. Nonetheless, we have to start somewhere, and I think that the current situation deserves our attention.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7105569" data-originallang="fr">There are different ways to promote hatred, and promoting Holocaust denial is one of them. There are no words to describe the Holocaust. I too visited some sites in Poland. I was speechless. The idea that a human being could do such things is unfathomable. I cannot even claim to be better than those who committed these horrific crimes. I think that, no matter how much we try to avoid it, these kinds of things can happen to anyone in any society. I understand that, in certain circumstances, any society can be faced with these types of dilemmas. I would almost say that I feel as sorry for those who perpetrated these atrocities as I do for their victims. It is unbelievable.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7105570" data-originallang="fr">I feel a strong sense of solidarity with the Jewish community, and I sympathize with what it has to live with. It is unacceptable for anyone to deny the impact of the Holocaust, or sometimes the fact that it even happened, or to trivialize it. We must make sure that the Holocaust is never forgotten and that its importance is never diminished.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7105571" data-originallang="fr">As I was saying, Bill <a data-HoCid="11535416" href="/bills/44-1/C-250/">C-250</a> is not perfect. It proposes a definition of the Holocaust. As I mentioned, I visited sites in Poland. I saw what it was like. Even so, I find it somewhat difficult to explain what it is. It is something so inhuman and senseless that it is hard to imagine. Therefore, I want to hear from experts in committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7105572" data-originallang="fr">Perhaps the definition being proposed by my colleague from <a data-HoCid="278477" href="/politicians/kevin-waugh/" title="Kevin Waugh">Saskatoon—Grasswood</a> is fine, or perhaps it can be improved. I would like to hear from experts on how to define the Holocaust accurately enough so as not to diminish other genocides, yet highlight what happened at the time and ensure that it never happens again.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7105573" data-originallang="fr">The committee also needs to hear explanations of the different potential definitions of the Holocaust as well as their negative effects. It is not that hard to guess, but I still want to hear from the experts.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7105574" data-originallang="fr">My colleague across the way was talking earlier about someone in his riding who was wondering whether he should take down the mezuzah from his door and stop his children from wearing a kippah to the park. That is unacceptable. We certainly do not want that. These are the harmful effects of Holocaust denial and hatred of others. I want people to come talk to us in committee, people who might help us better understand the situation so we can respond to the problem more effectively.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7105575" data-originallang="fr">We need to do all this while making absolutely sure that we do not fall into the trap of adopting provisions that conflict with the freedom of expression provisions in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. As my colleague said, freedom of expression is in the charter. It is also in the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. It is a principle we all hold dear, in Quebec as well as in Canada, and even throughout the western world. It is one of our most precious freedoms.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7105576" data-originallang="fr">We have to be careful though. If I can put it this way, we will have to “handle” Bill C‑250 prudently and sensitively. This has to be dealt with. We have to address the situation, act on our responsibility and make sure we are responding to the concerns of the Jewish community. This community's concerns are shared by society as a whole in different ways and for different reasons. We all need to care about this. We cannot ignore what is happening in these situations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7105577" data-originallang="fr">We will have to be careful, but this is something that must be done. We also have to ensure that we do not duplicate what already exists in section 319 of the Criminal Code, which is quite clear. The provisions in Bill C‑250 may not have as broad a scope and may already be covered by section 319. If so, we will have to find a way to harmonize it all. We do not want to simply duplicate what is already in the Criminal Code; we want to supplement it, or to ensure that we have a text that the courts can interpret in such a way as to achieve the objective set out in Bill C‑250.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7105578" data-originallang="fr">For all these reasons, the Bloc Québécois will be voting to send Bill C‑250 to committee so that we can work on it and so that, while we may never fully comprehend, we can strive for a better understanding of the tragedies that members of the Jewish community may endure, as well as the inhuman events that took place in the 1940s, particularly in the concentration camps in Poland.</p>
