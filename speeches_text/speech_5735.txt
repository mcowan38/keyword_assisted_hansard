<p data-HoCid="8794004" data-originallang="en"> We were informed that there were consultations done with the Palestinian and Arab communities. However, we don't know who was consulted as part of the consultations around the Canadian anti-racism strategy. I am not aware of which groups or which individuals they spoke to. No one has come forward to say that they have actually met with the ministry. I have had discussions with the ministry to reinforce the importance of recognizing anti-Palestinian racism and to express what was happening to our community and our allies in our community, but that was not part of the formal consultation process. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8794005" data-originallang="en">What we find really puzzling, however, is that the anti-racism strategy recognizes in three instances that Palestinians have experienced an unprecedented level of hate in Canada. However, the strategy then does not go forward into recognizing anti-Palestinian racism as a distinct form of racism. </p>
