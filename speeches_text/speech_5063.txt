<p data-HoCid="8642320" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8642321" data-originallang="en">Thank you to the witnesses for being here. I appreciate your excellent testimony. It certainly is clear that Canada faces very serious public safety and national security threats as a result of foreign interference.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8642322" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Chair, as a result of that, I'd like to give verbal notice of the following motion: </p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8642323" data-originallang="en"> Given that: </p>
<p data-HoCid="8642324" data-originallang="en"> Samidoun is a proxy for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a listed terrorist organization in Canada since 2003, to raise funds to finance PFLP's violent attacks on Jewish people; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8642325" data-originallang="en"> On the first-year anniversary of the horrific October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attack in Israel, Samidoun hosted a protest in Vancouver in which a speaker told the crowd, “We are Hezbollah, and we are Hamas,” and chanted “Death to Canada! Death to the United States! And death to Israel!”; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8642326" data-originallang="en"> Samidoun openly supports Hezbollah and Hamas, which are both listed terrorist organizations in Canada; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8642327" data-originallang="en"> Samidoun is banned in Germany, with the German government saying they serve as an “international network which disseminates anti-Israel and anti-Jewish propaganda” and “supported and glorified various foreign terrorist organizations, including Hamas”; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8642328" data-originallang="en"> Samidoun's leadership was deported from Germany in 2019 and denied entry to the European Union in 2022; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8642329" data-originallang="en"> Samidoun demonstrations promote Jew hatred and pro-terrorism messages that encourage anti-Semitic threats and violence in Canada. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8642330" data-originallang="en"> And given that: </p>
<p data-HoCid="8642331" data-originallang="en"> Ansar Allah, also known as the Houthis, is a Yemen-based terror proxy of Iran that, since the October 7 terror attacks, has disregarded international law by launching attacks on innocent civilians and merchant vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8642332" data-originallang="en"> That our closest allies, the United States, Australia, and Israel, have already designated the Houthis as a terrorist group; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8642333" data-originallang="en"> Canada has provided logistical support to the armed forces of the U.S. and the U.K. that have conducted air strikes against the Houthis. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8642334" data-originallang="en"> The committee report to the House that it recognizes that Samidoun and the Houthis are a threat to public safety and recommends that they both be listed as terrorist entities under section 83.05 of the Anti-terrorism Act. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8642335" data-originallang="en">In fact, Chair, I would like to seek unanimous consent from all parties to adopt this motion now, at this meeting.</p>
