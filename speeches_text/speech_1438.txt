<p data-HoCid="7040339" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7040340" data-originallang="en">I want to thank both of our witnesses today. This has been extremely enlightening and very interesting. It is very worrying, as well, as we're hearing about backsliding in protections for human rights around the world. It is deeply disturbing to hear this. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7040341" data-originallang="en">One of the things I picked up on a number of times, Ms. Deif, was when you spoke about turning a blind eye and the need for Canada—as the country that we all want Canada to be—to continually call out these abuses when they happen. What happens when we don't do that? What happens when Canada turns a blind eye, as it has done in Israel and Palestine, and in other countries? </p>
<p data-HoCid="7040342" data-originallang="en">We had a witness from the Philippines come to this committee and testify on the impacts that Canadian companies working in her country have had. Her life was in danger. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7040343" data-originallang="en">What obligations do we have, as Canadians, to call this out? What happens when we don't meet that obligation?</p>
