<p data-HoCid="6692626" data-originallang="en">My point was this. Just listening to Madam Chabot and Madam Gazan, I think the study that was already proposed, amended and unanimously agreed to by this committee to study seniors in COVID, given as we well know that they're the hardest-hit group in Canada.... They are worthy of a study and priority, which may be difficult for the Liberal government to recognize, but I do think that seniors are worthy of being a priority at this committee. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6692627" data-originallang="en">I think that what the Bloc and the NDP have said would suit well in that study and would encompass the things we're looking to do. Just to reiterate, seniors have suffered more than any other demographic in this country in the last year, so for the HUMA committee not to study seniors in the worst year on record for seniors, I think would be a huge oversight and quite disappointing. I would just like the committee to consider that in the vote. </p>
