<p data-HoCid="7735908" data-originallang="en">There has been some discussion, as Mr. Godin, Ms. Gazan and Madame Bérubé know. It is always my fervent effort to make sure we find more common ground rather than disagreement here. I'm not sure procedurally how we do it, but perhaps we can do it on unanimous consent.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7735909" data-originallang="en">I'd like to suggest that we put words back in section (b). It should read, “quality, availability, affordability and accessibility” so that those values and principles are part of that paragraph. If we could do it by UC, that would be great, so we can move on with the work of the day.</p>
