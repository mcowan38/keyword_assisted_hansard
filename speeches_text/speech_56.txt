<p data-HoCid="6081100" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, I was just wondering if the committee would consider hearing what Mr. Vaughan is working on. It looks like an amendment to Ms. Young's motion that would adopt the spirit of Ms. Gazan's motion or amendment.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6081101" data-originallang="en">My understanding, when I heard it, was that it was a little longer than a normal amendment but that it was an amendment. It was not presented in the formal way of a motion. It came out during the discussion on the current motion moved by Ms. Young.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6081102" data-originallang="en">I would ask the committee to listen to Mr. Vaughan's proposed amendment.</p>
