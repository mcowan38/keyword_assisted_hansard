<p data-HoCid="7345515" data-originallang="en"> I said this from the very beginning, and I will repeat that. Absolutely, we will make sure that the enhanced training on anti-Semitism, anti-racism, anti-discrimination and anti-hate for all program officers includes sensitivity and fighting against hatred towards francophone community members.
