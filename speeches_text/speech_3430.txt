<p data-HoCid="8172454" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Chair, again, I'll see if any of my colleagues want to jump in here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8172455" data-originallang="en">We have non-combatant evacuation operation contingency plans for all kinds of regions throughout the world. We did it recently in the Sudan, and we did it recently and prepared for it in Lebanon and Israel. We're prepared and can do those types of things.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8172456" data-originallang="en">That being said, how can we set the conditions so that the situation will never occur? That's through the kind of presence we're creating right nowâ€”and I'm talking militarily. Clearly, we have other trade, people-to-people connections and a lot of other activities that will try to lower the temperature there to prevent that from happening.</p>
