<p data-HoCid="8569011" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I am rising on a point of order in relation to the point made by the member for <a data-HoCid="299805" href="/politicians/ben-carr/" title="Ben Carr">Winnipeg South Centre</a> after question period yesterday.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8569012" data-originallang="en"> The member for <a data-HoCid="278390" href="/politicians/michael-barrett/" title="Michael Barrett">Leeds—Grenville—Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes</a> heckled me, asking if I received a thank-you letter from Hezbollah. Members of the Conservative Party in the House have repeatedly maligned me personally, using unparliamentary language, over the past several days. As a Jew and as an Israeli Canadian, this is abhorrent. I, like many Canadians in this country, am witnessing the war in the Middle East and watching my loved ones being impacted on both sides of the border. To make such disparaging personal comments while my family and so many, on either side, are suffering and who are under constant threat of rocket fire during this horrific war is beyond shameful.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8569013" data-originallang="en"> I have dedicated my life's work to bridging between peoples, to bring peace into the region and to bring a pathway so that people can live in safety and security in the Middle East, particularly Israelis and Palestinians who live in the region. We come to the House every single day to do the work for Canadians to make their lives better and be a force of good on the international stage.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8569014" data-originallang="en"> The member for <a data-HoCid="278390" href="/politicians/michael-barrett/" title="Michael Barrett">Leeds—Grenville—Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes</a> diminishes himself. He diminishes the House. I am requesting that he withdraw his comments from question period yesterday and apologize. The House and Canadians deserve better than this. They do not deserve bullies like this in the House. </p>
