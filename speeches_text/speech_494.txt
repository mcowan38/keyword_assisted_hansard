<p data-HoCid="6436078" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Smith.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6436079" data-originallang="fr">Yesterday, additional assistance was announced. Mr. Roy spoke about this earlier. Several months ago, I wrote to the <a data-HoCid="253406" href="/politicians/steven-guilbeault/" title="Steven Guilbeault">Minister of Canadian Heritage</a> to ask for funding for performance and cultural activities. I'm pleased to see a step in the right direction. We pushed for this as well.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6436080" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Smith, you brought up a good idea for everyone from artists to craftspeople to technicians. It's the concept of a guaranteed minimum income, or basic income, which would provide some form of social safety net. We in the NDP are interested in this idea and we're looking into it. My colleague from <a data-HoCid="253019" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> tabled a motion on the issue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6436081" data-originallang="fr">I want to know how this could apply to your members. How could this provide more security for the cultural community as a whole, meaning for artists and craftspeople?</p>
