<p data-HoCid="7988422" data-originallang="en">Yes, I read that. The statement I believe said that it was the result of a rocket fired from within Gaza, which would imply that it was fired by a terrorist group within Gaza. That, combined with the word “illegal”, would suggest that the Government of Canada has assessed that the rocket firing was deliberate and not proportionate. That's what logically those two statements combined would lead one to conclude. That's why I asked what the Government of Canada meant when it said that the explosion at the Gaza hospital was illegal.</p>
