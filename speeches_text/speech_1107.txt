<p data-HoCid="6791897" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791898" data-originallang="en">Thank you, again, to the witness.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791899" data-originallang="en">You referenced the Canadian government condemning settlements, evictions and demolitions as illegal, but you didn't mention the occupation, as such. We have a situation where, as long as this goes on or the longer this goes on, we see the permanent denial of the freedoms, rights and equality of the Palestinians on a longer basis. Clearly, something has to be done to stop that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6791900" data-originallang="en">While you might vote against the resolution because you don't like the preamble, could Canada not be stating that it regards this occupation as illegal and look for an end to it?</p>
