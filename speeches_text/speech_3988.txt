<p data-HoCid="8381411" data-originallang="en">I should note that there were some additional interpretation issues on the back end of this broadcast, but I digress.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8381412" data-originallang="en">Although education is certainly a big, proactive step on the continuum of misinformation and disinformation, I wonder if the witnesses could provide some insight, again, in terms of accountability from their perspective. If there's anything missing, what should we be considering at this committee as recommendations to help provide better legislative, regulatory and, in some instances, perhaps criminal responses to accountability for the willful spread? I give reference to the way in which these are sometimes used to instill hate, incite political and social violence and target minority groups. I referenced the trans community, the indigenous community, the Black community, the Jewish community and the Muslim community, you name it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8381413" data-originallang="en">Could you reflect on how we can better hold people accountable? This could include platforms or corporations, more broadly.</p>
