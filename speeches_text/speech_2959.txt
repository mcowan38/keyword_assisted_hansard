<p data-HoCid="8024848" data-originallang="en">Sure. We can do this in reverse order.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8024849" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Ms. Gazan. What I'd say to you is that those are very troubling statistics. I remarked on them myself. I was given a slightly different version: All of them were men, and out of 26 cases, 20 involved people who were white, with only six racialized people. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8024850" data-originallang="en">I think the importance of what you're underscoring is that we need a system that reflects better the statistical likelihood that you're going to have wrongful convictions across the prison population. When you look at the overrepresentation of indigenous and Black individuals in this country in the prison population, and you look at the number of women in the prison population, it is statistically improbable—probably impossible—that there's never been a wrongful conviction of a woman in this country, for example.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8024851" data-originallang="en">I think the way we address it is that we do some of the things that are targeted in the legislation, such as outreach activities where you're actually in prisons, explaining to people that there is this process that's available. You're looking at providing access to legal assistance. Sometimes we know that people are only as good as the lawyers they can afford to hire. By providing actual legal assistance, you're empowering those indigenous and Black people who are in prison populations. There's also providing translation and interpretation. That might beg the question of whether that would be provided in indigenous languages. I hope so, but I don't know the answer to that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8024852" data-originallang="en">Lastly, there's even reintegration support. Sometimes it's daunting to raise the spectre of a wrongful conviction and then be given bail. As Ms. Besner just mentioned, when you have that bail provided to you, all of a sudden you're outside a prison system that you've been in for 18 years, hypothetically. You don't have the ability to house yourself, feed yourself or get employed.</p>
