<p data-HoCid="6844942" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Ms. Oko. Thank you, Ms. Gazan.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6844943" data-originallang="en">That concludes the questions for this panel of witnesses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6844944" data-originallang="en">Ms. Oko, your testimony touched and moved every one of us. I completely agree with Ms. Dancho that we should all be so fortunate to have an advocate like you. Your telling of your deeply personal story of your mom certainly has impacted us and has undoubtedly helped many other families in a similar situation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6844945" data-originallang="en">Ms. Majowski, you're probably aware that another parliamentary committee has recently completed a study with respect to elder abuse. It is something that has the attention of parliamentarians, due in no small part to your advocacy and that of others in that sphere.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6844946" data-originallang="en">Thank you for the work that you're doing. Please know that it's making a difference. We very much appreciate your being with us today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6844947" data-originallang="en">Colleagues, we're going to suspend while we bid adieu to these witnesses and do a sound check for the next witnesses to come.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6844948" data-originallang="en">We'll suspend for a couple of minutes. </p>
