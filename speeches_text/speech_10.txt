<p data-HoCid="6038514" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, to address the points, sure we have been debating the concept of free trade, but not the details, the sausage itself, to go back to my Yiddish proverb once more. The details are where it is most important. That is where we reveal what has actually been debated in the past.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6038515" data-originallang="en">British Westminster parliaments have been debating free trade at various degrees since 1834. The corn law debate founded the magazine <em>The Economist</em>. It was founded for the purpose of fighting the corn laws, an issue of free trade. We can debate free trade and have a public debate outside of this chamber, but the details of the actual agreement before us have only been presented in the last few weeks.</p>
