<p data-HoCid="8756620" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, does the member know that if he lets this issue go to committee, he might get answers to the questions he wants? The irony is that Conservatives are going to stand in here and just lecture all day long, but in letting this get to committee, the member might start to get answers. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8756621" data-originallang="en">By the way, I thought this whole issue was about getting the documents for the RCMP. That is what they kept talking about, and now, suddenly, they are trying to suggest it is something else.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8756622" data-originallang="en"> The reality is that Conservatives are hell-bent on ensuring this issue jams this place so they can keep talking about it. The member does not really want an answer to that question. He wants to keep asking hypothetical questions that can make people go “oh yeah” and draw conspiracy theories and go down rabbit holes. That is what that line of questioning is all about. It is not about getting to the truth, because if it was, he would let this motion pass and go to committee. </p>
