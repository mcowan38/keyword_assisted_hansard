<p data-HoCid="8703344" data-originallang="en">Israel has no reason to pursue peace in its own interest right now without pressure. There's no real pressure, and I think we're seeing the consequence of that impunity play out right now in the region.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703345" data-originallang="en">For a very long time, Israel had a policy of negotiating while at the same time making sure, through the construction of settlements, that a Palestinian state would not be possible. That was said openly in the Knesset among Israeli politicians. It was acknowledged that it was okay to let Tzipi Livni or someone else go to the negotiating table, but that if the government were to actually pursue a Palestinian state, they would make the government fall. That's been the approach.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703346" data-originallang="en">Israel needs to feel a pressure in order to actually move on this.</p>
