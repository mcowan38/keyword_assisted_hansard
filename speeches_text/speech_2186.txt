<p data-HoCid="7707216" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7707217" data-originallang="en">One of the things that we're losing track of with this conversation is that we're looking at this within the context of Afghanistan. Of course, Afghanistan was where this became very apparent, but this legislation that you've put forward will have implications as far-reaching as Gaza, Nigeria, Mali, the CAR, Syria, all of these different countries. This is a massive legislation change for the international development sector, for the humanitarian sector. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7707218" data-originallang="en">I'm not certain, listening to some of the questions I've heard from your colleagues, that they understand that this is not about the aid that you've provided to Afghanistan. This is about changing the way that international and humanitarian organizations are allowed to work in this space. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7707219" data-originallang="en">I have to follow up on what my colleague, Mr. Brunelle-Duceppe, has said. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7707220" data-originallang="en">At this point, this government—Global Affairs Canada—is unable, most often, to meet its obligations in terms of decision-making on funding announcements and refugee status. This government is not good at making timely decisions. Humanitarian crises happen in places where timely decisions are vitally important. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7707221" data-originallang="en">I would also point out that failing to recognize the urgency of that means that Canadian organizations can't be there; they can't be on the ground doing the work we need them to do. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7707222" data-originallang="en">How can we trust that if this is going through.... With all due respect, Minister, I spoke to you. I spoke to <a data-HoCid="245291" href="/politicians/david-lametti/" title="David Lametti">Minister Lametti</a>. I spoke to <a data-HoCid="278930" href="/politicians/harjit-s-sajjan/" title="Harjit S. Sajjan">Minister Sajjan</a>. Nobody took ownership of this for 18 months. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7707223" data-originallang="en">How on earth can I go to the sector, go to representatives from MSF, from World Vision, from so many of the amazing organizations working in this space, and say, “Don't worry. They've never gotten it right, but they're going to get it right this time”?</p>
