<p data-HoCid="8453820" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, MP Zahid, for the question. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8453821" data-originallang="en">This is an important answer, so I would ask that you bear with me. I'm going to give you a number of facts and statistics that I think are very important. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8453822" data-originallang="en">The first one is for the number of TRV applications from Palestinian nationals approved between October 8, 2023 and May 10, 2024. It excludes the Gaza public policy and assisted departure applications. That is 448. The number of visas issued as part of the Gaza public policy—going directly to your question—is 250. As you know, because the figure has been quite public, there have been 870 people assisted as part of the assisted departure applications. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8453823" data-originallang="en">The question may come up regarding those who are presumed to have come here. We have, as a number, 987 individuals with Palestinian authority travel documents presumed to have travelled to Canada between October 15, 2023 and April 30, 2024. That in itself, obviously, would exclude people travelling on Canadian documents.</p>
