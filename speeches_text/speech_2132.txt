<p data-HoCid="7602091" data-originallang="en">Would you be able to provide to the committee a copy of the new screening mechanisms? I would like to see how department officials are now being trained on anti-Semitism and other forms of hate, what the new training process is and what the new vetting process is. Could you provide those documents to the committee?</p>
