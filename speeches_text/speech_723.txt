<p data-HoCid="6540683" data-originallang="fr">That would be a very useful avenue to explore. As to nutrition north Canada, this program was poorly received in all the regions where I worked. People saw it at a form of abandonment.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6540684" data-originallang="fr">The price of certain foods deemed healthy according to the program was indeed lowered.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6540685" data-originallang="fr">When the program was set up, local authorities in many places, and I witness this myself, said that the federal government wanted to change the Inuit into rabbits. But the Inuit do not eat carrots. Foods chosen by the Canadian government because of their healthy or nutritional value were not necessarily the foods favoured by the local population.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6540686" data-originallang="fr">There is a hint of neocolonialism in the lists of items that were deemed healthy and subsidized by nutrition north Canada and that were forced onto the communities, telling them what defines healthy eating. Many people would be thrilled to see the lists disappear.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6540687" data-originallang="fr">There should be transportation subsidies for all items that can be bought in stores. As you know, these general stores sell everything, including hunting and fishing equipment, but the government prefers to subsidize fresh fruits and vegetables which, as many witnesses have said, are not necessarily fresh by the time they are on the shelves. Why not subsidize hunting and fishing gear which would allow local people to get the healthy foods they prefer?</p>
<p data-HoCid="6540688" data-originallang="fr">Budgetary limits imposed at the start of the program have created an untenable situation for local community representatives. The representatives understood that they were made members of the nutrition north Canada Advisory Board to be part of the decision-making process and take food items off the list, but this was not what they wanted. I don't know if this is still the case, but it has happened that representatives from northern communities left the room because they felt that they were legitimizing the program in a way.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6540689" data-originallang="fr">The program should be extended. Just because you have road access does not mean that prices are necessarily lower. I surveyed prices in communities accessible by rail and the prices there were 57% higher than in urban areas. Prices in communities that are an eight-hour drive from the city of Qu√©bec via a forestry road were 40% higher than those in the closest town.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6540690" data-originallang="fr">All these communities are ineligible because of reasons linked to the history of the program, which to my mind is unfair.</p>
