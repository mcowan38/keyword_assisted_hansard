<p data-HoCid="6017199" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, Canadians know we are a strong friend of Israel. We have maintained our opposition against the unfair singling out of Israel at the UN and have voted against the vast majority of these Israel-related votes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6017200" data-originallang="en"> Canada is committed to the goal of comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East, including the creation of a Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6017201" data-originallang="en"> In keeping with Canada's long-standing position, which has been expressed by our government, it is important at this time to restate our commitment to a two-state solution. We will always stand for Israel.</p>
