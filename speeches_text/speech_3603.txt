<p data-HoCid="8276054" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, my colleague has long spoken in the House about the need for peace in the Middle East and for the rights of Israeli and Palestinian people.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8276055" data-originallang="en">This moment in time is pivotal. It is vital. It is vital that we take the steps we can now, that we work with our allies and that we signal to the international community that human rights matter and they matter wherever those human rights are being attacked. Palestinian human rights are not less than those of any other person. Children, regardless of where those children live, deserve to grow up and they deserve to have enough food to eat. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8276056" data-originallang="en">Think about the acronym “wounded child, no surviving family”. That is why we need to do more. It is why we need to do more right now.</p>
