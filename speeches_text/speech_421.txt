<p data-HoCid="6403426" data-originallang="en">I just want to follow up on my colleague Mr. Bergeron's comments. Since this issue has been discussed here broadly, there are many Canadians, including Jewish Canadians, who believe in human rights, who seek sustainable peace and justice in the Middle East and who are heartened by the support of Canada on the self-determination resolution. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6403427" data-originallang="en">The preamble to many resolutions is not something that we always agree upon. The resolution itself supporting that self-determination is an important step for Canada to take on the international stage. I would like to think this is a step towards Canada being more engaged in trying to get closer to that two-state solution. It's not enough to say we support it. We've been saying that for many years, as has been pointed out by Ms. Dabrusin. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6403428" data-originallang="en">What is Canada actually prepared to do? What steps is Canada prepared to take to advance the cause of the two-state solution? We've asked already about support for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine refugees to help them sustain their lives. We need self-determination. We need to have basics first. Can we do that, and can we do other things?</p>
