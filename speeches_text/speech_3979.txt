Then, I just kind of broke it down for what that would be like in Saskatchewan, which would be five non-indigenous compared to 26 indigenous women. In a province the size of Saskatchewan, I would think everybody would be alarmed by those numbers.</p>

As we see, and as MP Gazan has spoken about, 80% of the children for which an Amber alert has been issued have been found. We need a system that isn't optional. The aboriginal alert is kind of optional. People can look at it, but we need a system that is put out there so that everybody sees it, so that those faces are out there and so that we can have that same kind of response. As an academic and a researcher, I would see that we would have many more found safely. We know time is important. Waiting 10 days to start to look is often too late already.</p>
