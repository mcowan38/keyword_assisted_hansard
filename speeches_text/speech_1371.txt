<p data-HoCid="6939485" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, the sense of urgency is so real. These are the lowest-income seniors in our country who have had clawbacks because of the failure of the Liberal government.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6939486" data-originallang="en">As the New Democrats, we are here to get help for seniors now. I want to give a shout-out to my colleague, the MP for <a data-HoCid="278631" href="/politicians/rachel-blaney/" title="Rachel Blaney">North Islandâ€”Powell River</a>, for being vigilant and pressing the government to fix this problem. We are here to help Canadians and seniors right now. We have been fighting this fight since the get-go. We want some certainty from the government and the <a data-HoCid="278919" href="/politicians/kamal-khera/" title="Kamal Khera">minister</a> that they are going to roll out immediate supports for those who need help now, in March, which is just weeks away, so that in April, all of the clawbacks will be repaid to the seniors who are struggling right now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6939487" data-originallang="en">Will the <a data-HoCid="278919" href="/politicians/kamal-khera/" title="Kamal Khera">minister</a> listen to the New Democrats, who are calling for a guaranteed livable basic income, brought forward by my colleague from <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>, so that no seniors are living in poverty? I hope the minister will really listen to the New Democrats' proposal to do that because we should all agree in the House that no senior and no person living with a disability should be living below the poverty line. They need a guaranteed livable annual income.</p>
