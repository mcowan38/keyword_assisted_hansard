<p data-HoCid="8577751" data-originallang="en">Right now, we need to respond to the horrific humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and that is exactly what we are doing. We are calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. We are also calling for a ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel. We condemn Iran for its horrific attack. Israel has the right to respond, but we certainly hope that there is not a further escalation of this conflict as it spreads further and further and harms more civilians.</p>
