<p data-HoCid="7732750" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> has been a tireless advocate for justice, for decency and for bringing our sisters home.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7732751" data-originallang="en">It is no secret that this prolonged and continuous genocide is persistent. It is persistent not only in the forms it has taken, such as violence against women or the results of poverty we are seeing, but it is also nefarious in the way the government operates. It is nefarious that it continues to limit the funding necessary to get to the organizations that need it most.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7732752" data-originallang="en">We have young people who are present with us today who need these kinds of resources. They need the support of their government to put that money into their pockets so they can do the work of community life saving.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7732753" data-originallang="en">Can the member speak about the importance of young people and their contributions to ending this crisis?</p>
