<p data-HoCid="8300546" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, we do have a presence on the ground in Egypt. We have an embassy in Cairo where we have immigration officials who are working both with Gaza as well as Sudan.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300547" data-originallang="en">Because we have a global case management system, we can actually work throughout our network. Some of these applications might actually be done in Jordan or any other place also. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8300548" data-originallang="en">As far as the major case load is concerned, it's right that we have different countries that form a cohort of that. These include Egypt, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Uganda and other countries. These are some of the applicants who actually have a different country of residence, and they are a part of the cohort we are seeing at this point. </p>
