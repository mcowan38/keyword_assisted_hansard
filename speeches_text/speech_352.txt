<p data-HoCid="6351693" data-originallang="en">On a point of order, Chair, this certainly predates your time and I don't know if I've fallen down another rabbit hole, but is the member saying that we never actually held any meetings on this subject? I find that really astounding. Maybe this is the new line of operation, that there never had been anything to do with WE, but I certainly remember meetings that I sat through. Maybe my colleagues could chime in and say whether they were at those meetings. Again, there is this disinformation that we're actually seeing being embedded into the record here. I think it's very, very unfortunate.</p>
