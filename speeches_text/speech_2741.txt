<p data-HoCid="7973172" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much, Mr. MacDonald.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7973173" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, I will now be moving a motion that I had put on notice. I'm moving it reluctantly. I would have preferred that we dealt with it on Thursday during the second hour, but in a conversation that I had with Ms. Blaney, she was not in agreement that this be dealt with in the open and in a transparent manner on a matter of extreme seriousness involving an incident that brought great shame on the institution of Parliament and brought great hurt to many Canadians, particularly Jewish Canadians. It's, therefore, in light of the refusal of the NDP to be transparent in how this committee moves forward in getting to the bottom of this disgraceful incident, I will now be reading my motion into the record. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7973174" data-originallang="en">I move:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7973175" data-originallang="en"> That, given the international embarrassment created by the Liberal government by allowing a former soldier of a Nazi military unit in World War II to attend and be recognized during the Address of the President of Ukraine, delivered in the House of Commons Chamber on September 22, 2023, and that either proper vetting was not done or the individual’s military record was ignored, the Committee begin a study, pursuant to Standing Orders 108(3)(a)(i) and (ii), concerning this matter, and for the purposes of this study, </p>
