<p data-HoCid="8679232" data-originallang="fr">The Government of Canada supports Palestinians' right to self-determination. Canada opposes permanent Israeli control over the occupied territories and opposes settlements.</p>

<p data-HoCid="8679234" data-originallang="fr">What has Canada done so far to support the Palestinians' right to self-determination, and oppose the permanent occupation and the expansion of settlements?</p>

<p data-HoCid="8679236" data-originallang="fr">Would one of them like to answer my question?</p>
