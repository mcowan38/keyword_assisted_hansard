<p data-HoCid="6920677" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, countries like Ireland, Sweden, Norway, Israel, the Czech Republic, the U.K., Spain and Denmark are all removing restrictions and mandates, and they are all countries that have a lower vaccine rate than Canada. Here in Canada, though, we have a Prime Minister who refuses to lead and instead is being divisive. I have to agree with the MP for <a data-HoCid="278558" href="/politicians/joel-lightbound/" title="Joël Lightbound">Louis-Hébert</a> when he said, “People don’t know where public health ends and politics begins.” </p>
<p data-HoCid="6920678" data-originallang="en">Canadians want their lives back, so again I ask the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, will he follow the evidence? Will he follow the science, end the mandates and end the restrictions quickly?</p>
