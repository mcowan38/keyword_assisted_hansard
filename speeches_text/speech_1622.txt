<p data-HoCid="7125374" data-originallang="en"> We have already addressed the issue of campuses. I think the campus has been a hotbed of anti-Semitism. We have Jewish students who have to become campus warriors, defending their right to wear a kippah or to have a table supporting Israel or to do any of these things. That's out of control.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125375" data-originallang="en">We know the IHRA definition. We've seen IHRA adopted in university institutions across the U.S. and across the U.K. Again, it's a tool. It's something to be able to help bring clarity. We get a number of cases at the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center from parents and students coming in who have faced discrimination, anti-Semitism and racism on campus. The answer from administration is that they're not really sure if it's anti-Semitism or not. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7125376" data-originallang="en">There's a definition. There's a way to deal with this. We need to see that being adopted much more widely across the country.</p>
