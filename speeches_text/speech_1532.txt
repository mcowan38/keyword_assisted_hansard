<p data-HoCid="7082410" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7082411" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Minister, for coming to the committee today. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7082412" data-originallang="en">I'm subbing in for MP Leah Gazan.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7082413" data-originallang="en">I would like to first ask the minister about core funding. The Women's Legal Education and Action Fund, in collaboration with 26 gender equality organizations across the country, called for your government to commit $25 million per year over 10 years for sustained core funding for women and gender equity organizations so that they are able to continue advocating for and providing frontline services and support to those in need and those who are fleeing violence.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7082414" data-originallang="en">This promise was included in the minister's mandate letter. As we know, the rates of violence are increasing, and really for many of the women who are faced with domestic violence and violence in our community, action is slow, so there's no time to wait.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7082415" data-originallang="en">When can we expect funds to be released to ensure that organizations on the front lines are able to respond to this violence [<em>Technical difficultyâ€”Editor</em>]?</p>
