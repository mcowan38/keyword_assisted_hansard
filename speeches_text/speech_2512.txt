<p data-HoCid="7929255" data-originallang="en">It is with a heavy heart that I rise to inform members of my resignation as Speaker of the House of Commons.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7929256" data-originallang="en">It has been my greatest honour as a parliamentarian to have been elected by you, my peers, to serve as the Speaker of the House of Commons for the 43rd Parliament and the 44th Parliament.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7929257" data-originallang="en">I have acted as your humble servant of this House, carrying out the important responsibilities of this position to the very best of my abilities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7929258" data-originallang="fr"> I want to thank you, colleagues, for your support and collegiality during my tenure in the Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7929259" data-originallang="en">The work of the House is above any of us; therefore, I must step down as your Speaker.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7929260" data-originallang="en">I reiterate my profound regret for my error in recognizing an individual in the House during the joint address to Parliament by President Zelenskyy. That public recognition has caused pain to individuals and communities, including the Jewish community in Canada and around the world, in addition to survivors of Nazi atrocities in Poland and other nations. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7929261" data-originallang="en">I accept full responsibility for my actions. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7929262" data-originallang="en">My resignation is effective at the end of the sitting day tomorrow, Wednesday, September 27, to allow preparations for the election of a new Speaker. Until that time, the deputy speakers will chair the House proceedings.</p>
