<p data-HoCid="8628741" data-originallang="en">I originally put this amendment forward at the beginning of May, following a meeting of the <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">leader of the official opposition</a> that took place at the end of April, when he stopped at.... In videos posted to social media, the opposition leader was seen thanking and encouraging people who were camped in what was described as a convoy-style protest. In that time, he also met with people who indicated support for Diagolon, which is an organization that, as I pointed out in the amendment, was referred to as a violent extremist organization by Canada's Integrated Terrorism Assessment Centre.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8628742" data-originallang="en">We have to be very clear here. We're not talking about theoretical dog-whistle politics. We are talking about the <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">leader of the official opposition</a>, somebody who clearly aspires to be prime minister. He met with individuals who espouse vile, racist, bigoted and far right views, then turned around and failed to condemn the organization and, obviously, the people who support it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8628743" data-originallang="en">It's very clear, from the previous hour, that we have a real problem in Canada with the rise of the far right. We have seen an explosion of hate crimes in our country targeting minority communities. We have seen hate crimes targeted at the Chinese community and Asian Canadians. We have seen hate crimes against the Jewish communityâ€”horrifying examples of anti-Semitism. We've seen clear, disturbing acts of Islamophobia. Of course, I talked about the ongoing reality of anti-Palestinian racism, which, unfortunately, the Liberals are not taking seriously, either. What's clear to me is that we need to be taking on the rise of the far right in the clearest of terms. That means condemning politicians who, dare I say, play footsie with the far right, who fail to condemn the far right and whose actions, in many cases, fuel the far right, legitimizing and normalizing absolutely abhorrent views that have no place not just in Canada but anywhere in the world.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8628744" data-originallang="en">Canada is going down a dangerous path. We're a country that has often been a leader when it comes to diversity, multiculturalism and inclusion. We've fallen behind on many fronts. There's a lot of work to do. I believe that, at this time, we are facing a crisis when it comes to the rise of the far right. I believe supporting this amendment is a clear example of calling out the mainstream support for it that we see from the <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">Conservative leader</a>, who aspires to be prime minister.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8628745" data-originallang="en">Of course, supporting a study on the rise of the far right is critical. Canadians are concerned. Many Canadians are targets and have been victims of hate crimes and the rise of the far right. This is a timely, critical issue that we in the heritage committee have the responsibility to take on.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8628746" data-originallang="en">However, I believe it begins by condemning the individual who aspires to be prime minister and who has, all too often, been seen to be very close to and supportive of people whose views are deeply disturbing and definitely unacceptable.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8628747" data-originallang="en">I certainly hope members of the committee will join me in supporting this amendment. Of course, I hope we can move forward in supporting this study as soon as possible.</p>
