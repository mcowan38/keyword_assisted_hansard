<p data-HoCid="6791890" data-originallang="en"> Certainly, on the vaccination question, we are quite concerned about the current state of affairs in the West Bank and Gaza. We have been discussing, with our partners, with donors and with the Palestinians, the plan for vaccination in both those areas. I've been told by the Palestinians that they are receiving doses from COVAX, and they have received and are receiving more vaccinations from other countries, partners and donors. </p>

It's part and parcel to the work we're doing, collectively, to help Gazans and Palestinians. You can provide medicine and food, but if COVID is still rampant, you're fighting a losing battle. </p>
