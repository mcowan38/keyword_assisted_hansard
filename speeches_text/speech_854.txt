<p data-HoCid="6649794" data-originallang="fr">As you might expect, it's another somewhat specific situation. I voted in favour of Ms. Gazan's amendment, and it was simply a procedural matter. In this instance too, we want to add something to the preamble that does not appear in any of the clauses of the bill.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6649795" data-originallang="fr">In this instance, even if the term “federal law” or “Canadian law” were not in the bill, should not my suggested amendment to the preamble have been ruled admissible, in accordance with chapter 16 of <em>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</em>, which was alluded to by my colleague Mr. Anandasangaree. Indeed, it was clarifying the bill.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6649796" data-originallang="fr">The question is for you, Mr. Chair.</p>
