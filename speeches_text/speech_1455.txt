<p data-HoCid="6953890" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I have heard the words of my colleague on the other side of the House. As a Jewish member of Parliament and a descendant of survivors of the Holocaust as well, I, like many Canadians, was shocked to see Nazi and Confederate flags. I was dismayed, angry and horribly hurt.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6953891" data-originallang="en">How many Nazi flags does it take? How many donors from the U.S. Capitol riots does it take? It is 1,100 people and counting who have donated to these illegal blockades. How many guns need to be seized? How much vitriol like “honk honk”, which is a term for “Heil Hitler”, do we need to see by these protesters on social media? How many times do we have to see clear indicators that what is out there is not about the hard two years that every Canadian has suffered? This is about something much deeper, darker and uglier that is threatening the stability of the House, the work that we do as legislators each and every day for our constituents and the democracy that we have to uphold.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6953892" data-originallang="en">When will it be an emergency for you and your colleagues across the floor—</p>
