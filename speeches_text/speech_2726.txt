<p data-HoCid="7976722" data-originallang="en"> There was clearly a business case. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7976723" data-originallang="en">Why were we not trying to figure out how we could fill the needs of that business case? That's what this is about. We have the potential. There were 18 proposals. After eight years, we're at zero. Why are we not prioritizing this, again given what's going on around the world? It extends beyond just what's going on in Israel right now. That's the issue of the day and it's very pertinent, but let's look at what's going on with the rest of Europe right now, with the invasion of Ukraine and what Russia has done with the energy markets across Europe. That's why Germany came here in the first place. That's why France came to us. That's why Japan has come to us. Now, here we are.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7976724" data-originallang="en">I hope that the committee will take this motion and look at it with the urgency that it needs and deserves. It's too bad we have to wait for something to happen in the world, like what has happened in multiple countries now, for this to happen, and for us to get to the point where the committee will take this with the urgency that is required. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7976725" data-originallang="en">Conservatives have always had a sense of urgency around getting our resources to market. We've always prioritized this. I hope the rest of the committee will do it now, but if what it takes is a global conflict for the committee to get on board with it, well, I guess, let's go.</p>
