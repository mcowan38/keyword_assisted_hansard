<p data-HoCid="6410116" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill <a data-HoCid="10866248" href="/bills/43-2/C-232/" title="An Act respecting a Climate Emergency Action Framework">C-232</a>, an act respecting a climate emergency action framework. I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the bill's sponsor, the member for <a data-HoCid="253019" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>, and thank her for her advocacy on many important policy matters, including UNDRIP. I hope she will pass on my thanks and good wishes to her partner, Romeo Saganash, who of course played an instrumental role in UNDRIP in the last Parliament.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6410117" data-originallang="en">Her bill today speaks to an issue of urgency and importance that the government and Canadians also support: climate change. Canadians know climate change threatens our health, our way of life and our planet. They want climate action now and that is what the government will continue to deliver.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6410118" data-originallang="en">Bill <a data-HoCid="10866248" href="/bills/43-2/C-232/" title="An Act respecting a Climate Emergency Action Framework">C-232</a>, an act respecting a climate emergency action framework, aims to legislate the government's commitments under the United Nations Framework on Climate Change, particularly its 2030 GHG emissions reduction target, while also complying with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6410119" data-originallang="en">It requires the <a data-HoCid="253376" href="/politicians/jonathan-wilkinson/" title="Jonathan Wilkinson">Minister of the Environment</a> to implement a climate emergency action framework in consultation with indigenous peoples and civil society, to table in Parliament a report on the framework within one year and a report on its effectiveness three years later.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6410120" data-originallang="en">Another private member's bill that we heard about a few moments ago, Bill <a data-HoCid="10866095" href="/bills/43-2/C-215/" title="An Act respecting Canada’s fulfillment of its greenhouse gas emissions reduction obligations">C-215</a>, an act respecting Canada’s fulfillment of its greenhouse gas emissions reduction obligations, aims to ensure that Canada fulfills its obligations under the Paris Agreement to reduce Canada's greenhouse gas emissions. The fact that these two private member's bills both relate to climate change and have been brought forward at this time by different MPs demonstrates the importance of this issue for all Canadians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6410121" data-originallang="en">Canadians continue to face the impacts of climate change during the COVID-19 pandemic. From forest fires and floods to ocean pollution and coastal erosion, Canadians are experiencing the impacts of climate change each and every day. Canada's climate is warming twice as fast as the average in the rest of the world. In the north, warming is nearly three times as fast. The effects of warming are already evident in many parts of Canada, and are projected to intensify in the near future.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6410122" data-originallang="en">It is important to note that climate change is a global issue. The science is clear. We cannot wait for the future to stop polluting, or to take steps to adapt to the impacts of climate change. Climate change action must start now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6410123" data-originallang="en">According to the 2018 special report “Global Warming of 1.5 °C”, by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, human activities have already caused approximately 1 °C of average global warming since the pre-industrial period. This special report also finds that global emissions must reach carbon neutrality around 2050 to limit warming to 1.5 °C. This was an objective that was identified in the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6410124" data-originallang="en">There are clear benefits to limiting global temperature increases to 1.5 °C, rather than 2 °C or higher. The Government of Canada recognizes the importance of these findings, and agrees that more action is needed globally and here in Canada. Addressing the climate change issue requires effective policies that will measurably reduce Canada's GHG emissions over the decades to come, while promoting clean growth.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6410125" data-originallang="en">We are ready. We are ready to take the necessary and decisive action to advance Canada's fight against climate change. This September we made a commitment in the Speech from the Throne to bring forward a plan to exceed Canada's 2030 target and legislate Canada's goal of net zero emissions by 2050. We are committed to reaching net zero in a manner that creates a globally competitive economy. Reaching net zero is a long-term project, and importantly a short-term project as well. It is also a tremendous opportunity for a more prosperous and resilient future. Achieving net zero will require a careful calibration to reflect Canada's unique circumstances including demographics, geography, the importance of our traditional resource economy and shared jurisdiction on the environment.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6410126" data-originallang="en">As economies reset, now is the time to set into motion some of these measures. We can take into account the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the context of economic regrowth and the transition to a sustainable low-carbon economy. Yes, we can build back better.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6410127" data-originallang="en">We will seek the advice of experts and Canadians as we chart our path to net-zero emissions in a way that supports sustainable growth, is sensitive to economic needs across the country and makes life more affordable for Canadians. Net zero is not just a plan for our climate. Net zero is a plan for our economic competitiveness in the global marketplace.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6410128" data-originallang="en">Transforming our economy for the future is not something one government can or should do alone. It will take time. To get this right, we have a lot of work to do with industry leaders, civil society, indigenous communities and all Canadians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6410129" data-originallang="en">In the coming year, the government will seek the advice of experts and will consult with Canadians to identify pathways to net zero that integrate its environmental, energy and economic objectives. We will seek input from Canadians on how Canada should innovate and transform our economy to ensure a just transition to a low-carbon economy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6410130" data-originallang="en">That is why the <a data-HoCid="253376" href="/politicians/jonathan-wilkinson/" title="Jonathan Wilkinson">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</a> introduced, on November 19 in the House of Commons, Bill <a data-HoCid="10959361" href="/bills/43-2/C-12/" title="An Act respecting transparency and accountability in Canada's efforts to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050">C-12</a>, an act respecting transparency and accountability in Canada's efforts to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050, which is also known as the Canadian net-zero emissions accountability act.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6410131" data-originallang="en">This legislation would put in place a clear framework for reaching net zero. It would require the setting of national targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions at five-year intervals, and it would ensure transparency and accountability through requirements for emission reduction plans, progress reports and assessment reports with respect to each target. Plans would contain important information, such as a description of the key emissions reduction measures the Government of Canada intends to take to achieve the target for a particular milestone year.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6410132" data-originallang="en">Clearly, many of the themes presented in both Bill <a data-HoCid="10866095" href="/bills/43-2/C-215/" title="An Act respecting Canada’s fulfillment of its greenhouse gas emissions reduction obligations">C-215</a> and Bill <a data-HoCid="10866248" href="/bills/43-2/C-232/" title="An Act respecting a Climate Emergency Action Framework">C-232</a> echo our government priorities. I want to thank hon. members who I have seen in the House for their contributions. Bill <a data-HoCid="10959361" href="/bills/43-2/C-12/" title="An Act respecting transparency and accountability in Canada's efforts to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050">C-12</a> aims to provide a stronger framework for achieving Canada's climate change plan, as it is not only a plan for our climate, but also a plan for our economic competitiveness in the global marketplace.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6410133" data-originallang="en">If we want to be competitive in the net-zero emissions economy of tomorrow, we must stay ahead of the pack. It is good news to see that the House is united in finding a legislative framework to get us there. Once again, I thank the member for bringing forward such an important topic. I look forward to further discussions on Canada achieving its climate targets.</p>
