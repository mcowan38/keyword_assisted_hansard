<p data-HoCid="8369830" data-originallang="en">Mr. Maloney, was there anything else on that point? </p>
<p data-HoCid="8369831" data-originallang="en"> I do want to move on. I've already made my decision. If somebody wishes to challenge me, please go ahead. I welcome that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8369832" data-originallang="en">This committee has agreed, unreservedly, a number of times that the study on anti-Semitism will commence when we finish this clause-by-clause. Nobody is not agreeing to that. We never put a specific date. In fact, I was trying to figure out a date last time, when nobody was able to agree. We want to finish this clause-by-clause on this bill that we are doing because we do have important work to do other than the bill. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8369833" data-originallang="en">I'm looking for everybody's attention here to continue so that we can do that. I've already made my decision. If anybody wishes to go against it, please say so. I have no problem. As the chair, I welcome it. I will continue, again, now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8369834" data-originallang="en">Shall clause 1 carry? </p>
<p class="procedural" data-HoCid="8369835">(Clause 1 agreed to: yeas 7; nays 4)</p>
<p data-HoCid="8369836" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8369837" data-originallang="en">I'm going to ask the member to move G-1.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8369838" data-originallang="en">Mr. Moore.</p>
