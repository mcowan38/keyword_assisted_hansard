<p data-HoCid="8352280" data-originallang="fr">Thank you very much, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8352281" data-originallang="fr">Ms. Halfyard and Ms. Brown, I'm watching you this morning, and I'd like to add a few comments to what my colleague has already said. I hope to have the opportunity to do a wonderful project like yours, in collaboration with my little girl, who is now two years old. I hope I'll be lucky enough to experience this wonderful complicity with her.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8352282" data-originallang="fr"> There's an interesting aspect I'd like to talk about. I recently met an Amnesty International activist at an event. I know that my colleague Ms. Gazan has already spoken about human rights and resource exploitation, and I know that Amnesty International also supports the women of the Wet'suwet'en nation. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8352283" data-originallang="fr">What additional support can this organization provide?</p>
