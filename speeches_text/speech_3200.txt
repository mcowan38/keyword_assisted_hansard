<p data-HoCid="8124749" data-originallang="en">Okay. I appreciate your answers. Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8124750" data-originallang="en">You mentioned UNRWA in your opening remarks. UNRWA has long had problems being associated with terrorism. For example, on May 8, 2008, Reuters reported that an UNRWA headmaster, a teacher, was a rocket maker for Islamic Jihad. More recently, after October 7, there were atrocities by Hamas. UN Watch documented some 20 UNRWA teachers and staff celebrating the atrocities on their social media accounts.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8124751" data-originallang="en"> Even more recently, just a week ago, there were allegations that one of UNRWA's teachers detained one of the Israeli hostages. This report was from an Israeli journalist, Boker, of Channel 13 in Israel. He said that one of the hostages was held for almost 50 days in the attic of a house by a teacher with UNRWA. This teacher is a father of 10 children who locked the abductee in the attic, hardly providing him with food and not providing him with medicine.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8124752" data-originallang="en">Is the department looking into this very serious allegation?</p>
