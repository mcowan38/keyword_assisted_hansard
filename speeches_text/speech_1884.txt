<p data-HoCid="7345927" data-originallang="en">I am about to complete it. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7345928" data-originallang="en">All I want to simply say, in an effort not to be repetitive, is that the communities are watching. They have waited to have this time with the department. This has been an egregious abuse by Mrs. Thomas and members of the Conservative Party to not allow the Jewish community to have the answers that they want to see todayâ€”or the francophone community, for that matter.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345929" data-originallang="en">I'm profoundly disappointed in such actions. They are selfish and they do not show leadership.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345930" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
