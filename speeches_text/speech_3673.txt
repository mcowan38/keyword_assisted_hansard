<p data-HoCid="8276372" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, after two months, I am aware of nearly 2,000 loved ones in Gaza who are still waiting to receive a code from IRCC to reunite with their families in Canada. Clearly, the 1,000 arbitrary cap is a problem. Even for those with codes, not one person has made it to safety, and not even people whose biometrics are completed. Meanwhile, families are reporting that their loved ones have been killed in an air strike.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8276373" data-originallang="en">Why can Canada not get people across the border when other countries can? What will it take for the <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">minister</a> to lift that cap?</p>
