<p data-HoCid="7988233" data-originallang="en">Thank you for the question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988234" data-originallang="en">We have also recognized over the past week, in our calls to individuals in both the West Bank and Gaza, that the telecom situation has been up and down. Sometimes we're able to contact them and sometimes we're not. We've been using email and phone and all methods of communication. It is very challenging in terms of reports of individuals who may have been killed or injured. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7988235" data-originallang="en">Again, we do not have any reports from the Palestinian territories right now, but of course we are available to receive additional information when people have additional information.</p>
