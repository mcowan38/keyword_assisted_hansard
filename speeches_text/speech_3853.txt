<p data-HoCid="8340304" data-originallang="en">I'm again going back to the idea of reconciliation in Canada between the Polish Congress and the Ukrainian congress, fixing the damage that's been done between the communities, because we're all on the same side. You've mentioned before that the Polish community in Canada are very strong supporters of Ukraine's fight for its freedom and to remain an independent, free, pluralistic democracy—that's what the Ukrainian congress wants, that's I think what parliamentarians on all sides of the House want.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8340305" data-originallang="en">Having an act of reconciliation, let me put it to you—you asked me if it's a good idea—would you participate in something like this, both in facilitating it and having a presence there in doing something like having Rabbi Moshe Azman of Kyiv or Rabbi Yaakov Bleich of Ukraine...? What could be better than one rabbi? You have two, so if you don't like the first one's opinion, you have the second one. Ask them—they love this joke all the time.</p>

This could be a constant reminder—a beautiful mezuzah—of what not to do and that people need to do their homework before they make parliamentarians make a grave mistake that damages the reputation of this institution, and all of our personal reputations as well.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8340307" data-originallang="en">Would you participate in something like that? What do you think of this idea?</p>
