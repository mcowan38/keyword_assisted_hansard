<p data-HoCid="6970179" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6970180" data-originallang="en">Thank you so much, everybody, for your powerful testimony. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6970181" data-originallang="en">I'm very pleased to be here replacing my colleague <a data-HoCid="281018" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Leah Gazan</a> for today's session—as the committee is quite familiar, given the work I was able to do a number of years ago in terms of the status of women—and seeing familiar faces like yours, Jane, and others earlier today. Thank you so much for being here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6970182" data-originallang="en">Ms. Stinson, I want to go to you. You highlighted some very key findings around access to transportation and access to employment. I want to highlight just how critical that is. I represent a northern riding; I live in a northern riding. In western Canada, we were the first to lose Greyhound services. While there have been some initiatives, nothing has fully replaced what we lost, and that's a big problem. It is probably best documented through the Highway of Tears, the vulnerability that northern and indigenous women face when they don't have access to safe transportation. I really appreciate your raising that. It's not a reality that's understood in the same way by anyone living in an urban centre, that's for sure. I appreciate that you raised those two areas.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6970183" data-originallang="en">I also want to highlight another key theme that many of you have raised, the need to access housing. We have a housing crisis in our country. It is particularly acute in first nations and in northern communities, but it truly is a full-blown crisis across the country, both in terms of supply but also in terms of access. Increasingly, access to safe housing is out of reach for so many Canadian women, even many who are working, given the reality, as you pointed out, Jane, of precarious work, etc.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6970184" data-originallang="en">I'm wondering, Ms. Stinson, if you could talk a bit about how urgent it is for the federal government to move on housing and invest in housing, all kinds of housing. I'd love to hear your thoughts.</p>
