<p data-HoCid="7958540" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, on October 7, the world woke up to an unspeakable horror. Hamas terrorists had brutally invaded Israel, intentionally killing over a thousand Israeli civilians and taking hostage over 100 more.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7958541" data-originallang="en"> More Jews were killed that day than on any single day since the Holocaust, for no other reason than they were Jewish. They were children, babies, men and women. They were young people just out listening to music at a dance party. This was an unprecedented, brutal, intentional attack.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7958542" data-originallang="en">We must not let anyone tell us that Hamas is the legitimate voice of the Palestinian people. It is not a government. Its members are not activists or freedom fighters. It is not a resistance movement. It is a genocidal, murderous terrorist death cult and it must be defeated.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7958543" data-originallang="en">The Conservatives unequivocally condemn the invasion of Israel by Hamas terrorists and affirm Israel's right to defend itself against these barbaric acts.</p>
