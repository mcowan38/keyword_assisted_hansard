<p data-HoCid="6081455" data-originallang="en">I'll be supporting MP Gazan's motion, and I think the urgency of the issue is front and centre to us. I think we need to set that as a number one priority and let the scheduling committee come back with timetables and consideration of the other motions that we have also put on the table. I think we need to be prioritizing the issue, and I think it's an important one to get under way as quickly as possible.</p>
