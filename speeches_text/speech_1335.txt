<p data-HoCid="6913346" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague from <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> and I share a lot in common, particularly with my district in Edmonton Griesbach, one of the hardest hit communities of poverty. My colleagues and I know the importance of ending poverty, and the Liberal legislation does not go nearly far enough in fixing the poverty issues.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6913347" data-originallang="en">Would the member agree that ensuring a guaranteed livable basic income is truly the appropriate response to ending poverty in Canada?</p>
