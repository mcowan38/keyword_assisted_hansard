<p data-HoCid="8499110" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8499111" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Brown, I'm going to come back to you, if I may.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8499112" data-originallang="fr">We have differing opinions on Bill 21, but that debate is for another time, since we only have two minutes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8499113" data-originallang="fr">Over the past few weeks, members of the Jewish community have appeared before the committee. They told us that Jews in Canada were being discriminated against, including by hate groups. Now people from the Muslim community have told us essentially the same thing. In both cases, I find it deplorable. In my opinion, it should not be happening.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8499114" data-originallang="fr">We're looking for solutions. I gather from your remarks that you don't see Bill 21, the state secularism law, as a solution. I'm not sure I understand your position. We believe the religious exemptions in the Criminal Code should be eliminated. We are looking for solutions, in any event, and the ones we've proposed are not perfect. They're certainly not the only ones.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8499115" data-originallang="fr">We do need to recognize Islamophobia, but I think we've already done that. Beyond that, do you see a reasonable, effective solution for combatting all forms of discrimination in Quebec and Canada, against the Muslim community, the Jewish community or any other community?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8499116" data-originallang="fr">I'd like to hear your comments on that.</p>
