<p data-HoCid="7870224" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7870225" data-originallang="en">I am just noting that CPC-36 should be distributed, but there are also CPC-37, CPC-38 and CPC-39.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7870226" data-originallang="en">On amendment CPC-36, I move that Bill S-245 be amended by adding after line 18 on page 1 the following new clause:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7870227" data-originallang="en"> 1.4 Section 24 of the Act is amended by adding the following: </p>
<p data-HoCid="7870228" data-originallang="en"> Respecting holidays and days of significance to promote Canada's multicultural identity </p>
<p data-HoCid="7870229" data-originallang="en"> 24.1 (22) Citizenship ceremonies may not be scheduled on Yom Kippur. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7870230" data-originallang="en">Yom Kippur is the Jewish Day of Atonement. It falls 10 days after Rosh Hashanah. It's a solemn day spent reflecting on one's actions in the previous year and spent asking for forgiveness and pleading for divine mercy. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7870231" data-originallang="en">Jewish law mandates a 25-hour fast from sundown to sundown and the observance of a special religious service, as well as a prohibition on washing and bathing oneself and on wearing leather shoes. Orthodox Jews as well, refrain from using electricity and from driving or riding, and from other forms of prohibited work.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7870232" data-originallang="en">From that description, it would be quite difficult for one of them to make it to an oath of citizenship. It might be considered as work, and therefore they would be unable to go. As I said, Yom Kippur is a Day of Atonement, but it is also a day of reflection, and it's one that's typically spent at home with family.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7870233" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, I don't think we should have citizenship ceremonies scheduled for that day. </p>
