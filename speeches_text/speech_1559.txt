<p data-HoCid="7125993" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125994" data-originallang="en">I just want to echo some of the things that have been said by my colleague Mr. Bergeron.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125995" data-originallang="en">What I was very much hoping to avoid in this committee was the filibustering, the shenanigans, the back and forth that prevented this committee from getting work done in the last Parliament. That was my goal. That was what I was hoping for.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125996" data-originallang="en">Certainly knowing the time we are in, where vaccine equity is an issue that is affecting billions of people around the world, and with the fact that we are in the midst of a war and need to make sure that we have the time to examine what Russia is doing in Ukraine, the fact that there are conflicts in Tigray, the fact that we have to have opportunities so that we can actually look at what's happening with Palestine and Israel, with Afghanistan, I am so dismayed that the Conservatives chose to put their petty politics in front of all those issues, all those very important issues.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125997" data-originallang="en">I have to say as well that the idea that they have done everything they can to work with members of this committee is completely false. We were asked, with three days' notice, to be here on a Friday afternoon. I made it very clear to members of the Conservative party that it would not be possible.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125998" data-originallang="en">First of all, I have House duty. I am a House officer. I can't give up that duty. I have an obligation to represent my constituents in the House of Commons. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7125999" data-originallang="en">I need to get back home to my constituency. That's what members of Parliament do on the weekend, so that I can be in my constituency, meeting with constituents. I make plans. All kinds of things are on my calendar so that I can reach out to my constituents on the weekend before flying back to Ottawa to be here next week to get to work. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7126000" data-originallang="en">I'm sorry, but three days' notice is not appropriate. To say you worked four months to get the committee to work together, and then gave us three days' notice on an emergency meeting, is completely inappropriate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7126001" data-originallang="en">We have a solution here that would give parliamentarians the ability to see those documents. We need to find a way to work like adults in the room so that we don't end up in a situation where we're filibustering in this committee. Our work is too important. I'm deeply disappointed in the fact that we weren't able to bring our witnesses forward today. I will be bringing forward a motion to ask for us to have that returned. I certainly hope Mr. Bergeron's prediction that they will find it not worth their time to be incorrect. I certainly hope they will agree to join us again. It was an important panel. It was going to give us important information, and I would certainly hope that we can have them back.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7126002" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
