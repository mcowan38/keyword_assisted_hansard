<p data-HoCid="7710645" data-originallang="fr">I've been working in this environment for years, and can tell you that people who use prostitutes come from all social classes. That's also true of prostitution with minors. The customers could be just anyone, but very often they are men in positions of power, businessmen, politicians or people working for big corporations. That's one of the reasons why they are afraid to inform.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7710646" data-originallang="fr">Among other things, women tell me that they are afraid they won't be believed. They wonder what what they say will matter compared to a politician or a well-known businessman who earns billions of dollars. There were a few scandals of this kind in Quebec. The women said that they would not be believed. So the fear of not being believed is one of the reasons why they don't come forward.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7710647" data-originallang="fr">Speaking of fear, one recommendation I might make to the committee is to do away with the notorious closed work permits. These are issued to young women from abroad who are supposedly required to work in places like Montreal's posh restaurants, but who end up working unwillingly in the sex trade. The so‑called employers, who are really pimps disguised as restaurant owners, use these permits to keep women on a tight leash. The women don't dare to report them, because they're afraid of being sent back to their home country. They are also afraid—</p>
