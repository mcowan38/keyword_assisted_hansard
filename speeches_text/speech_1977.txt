<p data-HoCid="7439672" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7439673" data-originallang="en">Thank you to the minister. I'm happy to be here today for this important work. I want to first convey regrets from my colleague, <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">MP Leah Gazan</a>, who is unfortunately unable to be here today but will go back to watch this entire meeting closely, I'm sure.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7439674" data-originallang="en">My first question today is about November 20, the Transgender Day of Remembrance. I feel it's important for us to talk about this when we are looking at the mental health of young women and girls. We know that transgender youth face much higher risks and rates of mental illness than youth in general. The Ontario chapter of the Canadian Mental Health Association, for example, noted that 2SLGBTQIA+ youth have 14 times the risk of suicide and substance misuse than their heterosexual counterparts, with transgender youth accounting for 77% of those seriously considering suicide.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7439675" data-originallang="en">Those numbers are really appalling and concerning. I wanted to bring them forward, because I know that recently, Minister, there was a 2SLGBTQIA+ action plan that was put forward, which can be applauded, of course, for the work that's happening in the right direction. But we also know we're hearing from the Canadian Centre for Gender and Sexual Diversity, Wisdom2Action executive director Fae Johnstone and the Enchant√© Network, who are talking about some critical gaps, flaws, and a lack of funding integrated within the plan specific to the unique challenges experienced by transgender, non-binary and gender non-conforming people. There are also some gaps being highlighted around the need for disaggregated data to better understand the unique experiences of transgender youth. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7439676" data-originallang="en">I'm wondering, Minister, if you could please tell us how you and your government plan to address the critical gaps in demands identified by 2SLGBTQIA+ individuals that end up leaving queer and trans people behind, and why this hasn't been developed long ago.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7439677" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
