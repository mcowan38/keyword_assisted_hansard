<p data-HoCid="8035635" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8035636" data-originallang="en">Mr. Hollingworth, I will still put questions to you. I know you are not able to respond. I'm very sorry about that. I'm very interested in your perspective, so I would really appreciate it if you would write to us.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8035637" data-originallang="en">The next question I have for you is that, knowing that Canada can and should be contributing to the rebuilding, to humanitarian assistance for Ukraine, my concern is that if that money comes from our ODA bucket instead of from a separate fund, as we used, for example, in Syria, that will take away from the contributions we need to be making for development around the world. I have some serious concerns about all of the resources going towards Ukraine at a time when we absolutely should be supporting Ukraine but we can't ignore that there are other issues around the world.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8035638" data-originallang="en">That's one question for you that I'd like your perspective on.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8035639" data-originallang="en">The final question I want to get your perspective on is this: You talked about hunger as a weapon of war and how Russia is using hunger as a weapon by targeting the specific food infrastructure that is in place. We know the conflict in the Middle East has resulted in the people of Gaza not having access to food. In fact, the head of the World Food Programme recently said, “Right now, parents in Gaza do not know whether they can feed their children today and whether they will even survive to see tomorrow.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8035640" data-originallang="en">I would love some insight from you on the use of hunger as a weapon of war and whether you think that is occurring currently in Gaza.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8035641" data-originallang="en">Finally, as we see the conflict in the Middle East, we know that, for example, Lebanon was one of the countries that needed the resources, the food from Ukraine. We saw very early on that people in Lebanon were struggling. As this conflict could potentially spread into Lebanon, what are the risks there and how do we mitigate them in any possible way?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8035642" data-originallang="en">I'm deeply worried about the people of Lebanon feeling the double impact of a conflict that is spilling into their region and food insecurity getting very much worse.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8035643" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
