I've also talked to my counterpart in the Palestinian Authority, and we need to make sure that this commitment to the rule of law by Israel is respected.</p>

I have been meeting also with the Muslim community and trying to find a way so that we can eventually, I hope, charter peace, and so that these two states are able to live in peace and security side by side.</p>
