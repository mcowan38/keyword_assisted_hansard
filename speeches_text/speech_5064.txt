<p data-HoCid="8638383" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Kushwaha, I am going to ask you a tough question. For the last 20 years, we have been watching news agencies like Agence France-Presse disappear. There actually are fewer than there were before. So the media are drawing on the few remaining sources.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8638384" data-originallang="fr">Personally, I remember that when I was in Africa in 2012—I was in Libya—the assassination of Muammar Gaddafi was reported differently in America and Africa.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8638385" data-originallang="fr">With few news sources to draw on, and with countless social media sites putting out information, how do we know what is going on today with the situation in Israel and Palestine?</p>
