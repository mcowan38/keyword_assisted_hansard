<p data-HoCid="7602009" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair and members of the committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7602010" data-originallang="en">I'm pleased to be with you today to speak about funding granted to and subsequently terminated for the Community Media Advocacy Centre, and the steps the Department of Canadian Heritage has taken to strengthen and clarify our grants and contributions processes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7602011" data-originallang="en">My name is Mala Khanna. I'm the associate deputy minister for Canadian Heritage, and I'm here with Charles Slowey, who is the assistant deputy minister for the community and identity sector. We are joining you today from the unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinabe people.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7602012" data-originallang="en">Let me start by reiterating that anti-Semitism and all forms of hatred have no place in Canada. Organizations and individuals demonstrating hateful and racist behaviour, whether anti-Semitic, anti-francophone, anti-Black, anti-indigenous or against any other racial or religious groups, should not be supported through government funding.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7602013" data-originallang="en">The hateful comments made by Mr. Marouf were shocking and profoundly disturbing to us. Had Canadian Heritage officials been aware of his comments, the project would not have been funded. As the <a data-HoCid="278914" href="/politicians/ahmed-hussen/" title="Ahmed Hussen">minister</a> did when he was before you on October 7, I would also like to apologize for the pain that this has caused.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7602014" data-originallang="en">In explaining what happened in this situation, I will start with a bit of context.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7602015" data-originallang="en">Canadian Heritage officials negotiate thousands of grants and contributions with individuals and organizations every year. Last year, the department administered $1.7 billion in grants and contributions, representing 80% of its total budget. In delivering these programs, the department follows established review procedures, which include the assessment of the public profile of the organization, the applicant's track record and financial issues.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7602016" data-originallang="en">In this case, the project on paper met the criteria of the anti-racism action program. There was an Internet search done of CMAC as an organization, but it was not done of the individuals who would be performing the work, because nothing came up after the search of CMAC. Had hateful comments turned up, the project would not have been funded.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7602017" data-originallang="en">On July 26, the <a data-HoCid="278914" href="/politicians/ahmed-hussen/" title="Ahmed Hussen">minister</a>'s office informed me by phone that there was an issue that would need to be looked into concerning anti-Semitism in one of our projects. On August 2, I received information from the minister's office via email about the case, including one of the offensive tweets. Between August 2 and August 19, the department determined how the individual was connected to the project, reviewed the contractual obligations, sought legal advice and ultimately suspended the project on August 19. The minister then terminated the agreement with CMAC, and the department is pursuing the recovery of funds that were paid to CMAC.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7602018" data-originallang="fr">At the October 7 meeting, the minister acknowledged that the time it took to suspend and terminate the agreement once we were informed of the hateful comments could have been shorter. I agree with him. We have learned from this experience and have taken steps to strengthen this process and shorten the timelines.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7602019" data-originallang="fr">At the October 7 meeting, <a data-HoCid="278914" href="/politicians/ahmed-hussen/" title="Ahmed Hussen">Minister Hussen</a> also stated that he had asked the department to conduct a full review of the existing process. As a result of this process, funding applications now explicitly state that projects that espouse hatred or discrimination are not eligible.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7602020" data-originallang="fr">In addition, applicants are now asked to certify, in writing, that they will not undermine the Anti-Racism Strategy and will respect the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Canadian Human Rights Act. The minister now has the option to immediately terminate a contract. We are conducting an online public information search on the organization and the individuals identified to work on the project. Program officers have received training on the new criteria and on anti-racism and anti-Semitism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7602021" data-originallang="fr">Using the new audit process, we reviewed each of the active and funded agreements, approximately 350 in total and approximately 200 additional applications, which fall under Canada's Anti-Racism Strategy. Funds are now flowing back to the communities, where they belong, so that groups can continue to undertake this important work.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7602022" data-originallang="fr">We are also undertaking a broader review of all Canadian Heritage programs and the results of this review will help us refine and improve our processes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7602023" data-originallang="fr">The department has undertaken significant work to address the serious issues that have been highlighted in this situation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7602024" data-originallang="fr">We would be pleased to answer your questions.</p>
