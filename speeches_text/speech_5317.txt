<p data-HoCid="8693871" data-originallang="en">Professor Larson, I have some questions for you with regard to the ICJ cases, both on the illegality of the occupation, for which the decision was granted on July 19, and on the South African case on the plausible genocide in Gaza. Considering those two cases, I'd like you to talk a little bit about how Canada has responded to those two cases and also what the recognition of the State of Palestine would mean going forward.</p>
