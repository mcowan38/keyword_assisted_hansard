<p data-HoCid="6276792" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, my constituents have reminded me that an unkept promise leads to a bad life, which is a Yiddish proverb. I have three petitions to table on behalf of my constituents today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6276793" data-originallang="en">The first petition is on equalization. Petitioners in my riding are drawing the attention of the Government of Canada to the unfairness inherent in the equalization system. Fifty-four petitioners have signed it.</p>
