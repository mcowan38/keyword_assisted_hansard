<p data-HoCid="6791865" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791866" data-originallang="en">I appreciate both of the witnesses being here today and their experience and depth of knowledge. I have a few questions to get through.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791867" data-originallang="en">Canadians have been watching this unfold very closely, and many have been horrified at the human rights violations they have seen. As people have been digging into it and more and more of my constituents have been asking me questions about Canada's role in this, I want to understand it better but also understand Canada's view as to the viability of the two-state solution.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791868" data-originallang="en">You look at the map currently, and it's like a whole bunch of puzzle pieces. There have been more and more expansions of settlements and forced evictions happening into the Palestinian territory. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6791869" data-originallang="en">What effect does that have on the fact that Canada believes in a two-state solution? Do we then believe, if we do not recognize the annexation of East Jerusalem and other territories in Gaza, that Israel would have to cede that area? What are our thoughts on that?</p>
