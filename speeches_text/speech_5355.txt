<p data-HoCid="8669778" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, the member was speaking about Bill <a data-HoCid="12830843" href="/bills/44-1/C-373/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (promotion of hatred or antisemitism)">C-373</a>. I would like to ask him about Bill <a data-HoCid="12839440" href="/bills/44-1/C-372/" title="An Act respecting fossil fuel advertising">C-372</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8669779" data-originallang="en">António Guterres, the head of the UN, has called fossil fuel companies the “godfathers of climate chaos”. He said they are moving us to a living hell and that countries and governments have to stop acting as “enablers”. Part of that, for Guterres, is a ban on fossil fuel advertising, as it is a threat to human health and a threat to the health of the planet.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8669780" data-originallang="en"> Would the member support Bill <a data-HoCid="12839440" href="/bills/44-1/C-372/" title="An Act respecting fossil fuel advertising">C-372</a>, which would limit fossil fuel advertising? It is a direct threat to human health.</p>
