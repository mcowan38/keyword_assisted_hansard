<p data-HoCid="8726589" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, I have spoken about this many times in the House. The reason I have spoken about it so many times is that it is not only the people I represent in Thornhill but communities right across the country who are reaching out in hopes that somebody is listening to their plight. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8726590" data-originallang="en">There have been firebombings into businesses, gunshots into schools and riots on a weekly basis in cities across the country. People have been made to feel unsafe in their neighbourhoods. Instead of even the weakest condemnation, it is actually worse; government members have inflamed it with their rhetoric. We have the member for <a data-HoCid="278589" href="/politicians/yaara-saks/" title="Ya'ara Saks">York Centre</a>, a minister of this Crown, who held hands with a literal terrorist, a man who is in the 19th year of his four-year term and has a martyr's fund that rewards terrorists for killing people who fight from her own riding. We have a pretend envoy on issues of anti-Semitism who speaks out against the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> and says all the right things in the community but does not have a seat at the table and is, frankly, ignored. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8726591" data-originallang="en">The community looks at the government and wonders, “What the heck happened?” This used to be a government that stood for moral clarity, on the right side of history and to protect a community, but this government is nowhere to be found. It is a shame for everybody who is watching, and not only the Jewish community but every freedom-loving, law-abiding Canadian who sees this. </p>
