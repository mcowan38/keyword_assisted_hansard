<p data-HoCid="7125328" data-originallang="en">That's great. Thank you very much for that commentary.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125329" data-originallang="en">I want to move into the room now for a couple of questions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125330" data-originallang="en">I may start with Mr. Marceau and then ask the same question to Ms. Kirzner-Roberts.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125331" data-originallang="en">Both of you mentioned the prevalence of anti-Semitism in Canada, of hatred towards the Jewish people. Mr. Marceau, you especially talked a little bit about the society and the culture that allow that to happen. I want to touch a little bit on the BDS movement, which we see, unfortunately, often on university campuses, and whether we, as parliamentarians at the federal level, should be taking stronger action on the BDS movement and what we ought to be doing to counteract that, especially on university campuses but more generally as well. Do you have any thoughts on that?</p>
