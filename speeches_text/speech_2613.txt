<p data-HoCid="7957546" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, I understand that there are very real emotions and really serious concerns, and I respect and acknowledge that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957547" data-originallang="en">What we are concerned about are the conditions right now that are being imposed on the people of Gaza, the conditions which involve no more electricity, no more clean water, no more access to food and no more access to the resources necessary to run a hospital. These conditions being imposed on an entire population are very serious. The consequences of actions like that are very dire. The United Nations has pointed out that the consequences of a path where necessary resources are withheld from a population could be devastating and dire. That is what I am expressing as a very deep concern. That is why we reiterate our call. Release all the hostages. We need to ensure that there is a ceasefire. We need to see a path of peace because we need to save all lives.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957548" data-originallang="en">Innocent lives have been lost. More will be lost if the steps that are being taken continue.</p>
