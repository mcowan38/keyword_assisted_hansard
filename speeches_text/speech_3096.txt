<p data-HoCid="8068016" data-originallang="en">The Canadian government reviewed the information on the hospital bombing on its own. The <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, quite emphatically, in the House of Commons and elsewhere, confirmed that it was not Israel that bombed the hospital.
