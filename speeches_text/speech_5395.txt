<p data-HoCid="8703298" data-originallang="en">Continuing in the same vein, I just want to provide a little more clarity. The question before this committee and the question for Canada is not whether to recognize Palestine as a state. I think we have broad support for that around this table. The broader question is when to recognize Palestine as a state so that it leads to peace and so that the peace has popular support. That's the question I want to come back to.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703299" data-originallang="en">I'll go to Mr. Awad and give you the same opportunity. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8703300" data-originallang="en">I don't think anyone is asking for a homogeneous position of the Palestinian people on the issues. The basis of my question is more around what system needs to be in place to lead to that lasting peace and to allow the voice of the Palestinian people to be reflected and represented. That, I don't see now. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8703301" data-originallang="en">That is why the result of negotiations and self-determination must come from the Palestinian people, but how do we get there? Is the problem of Iran part of the problem? </p>
