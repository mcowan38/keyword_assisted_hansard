<p data-HoCid="8520210" data-originallang="fr">Currently, section 319 of the Criminal Code prohibits the promotion of hate and anti-Semitism but includes an exemption. It is a reasonable defence if the opinion of the person accused of either of those offences is based on a religious text. I'm paraphrasing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8520211" data-originallang="fr">Do you have an opinion on that? The Criminal Code contains a provision that allows hate crimes if the person's opinion is based on a religious text or sincerely held religious belief. Is that a good thing or not?</p>
