<p data-HoCid="6791784" data-originallang="en"> The situation in Gaza before the 11-day conflict was almost unlivable, as the UN would say. There was a lack of water, medicine and health care. Unemployment has skyrocketed. The economy has nearly collapsed. It is a very difficult environment to live in. It has been exacerbated by COVID, and then by this conflict.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791785" data-originallang="en">As was mentioned, Hamas is controlling the place. We have no interaction with Hamas, as a listed terrorist organization, and the real challenge for everyone, for all donors, is to get the assistance to the people who need it. There are large numbers of vulnerable people, and in a way that doesn't benefit Hamas. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6791786" data-originallang="en">It is profoundly difficult to do that. It can only be done through extensive measures, working with our trusted partners, our humanitarian organizations with experience on the ground, to get the help where it is needed most. We can do it, but it is certainly made more difficult by Hamas's control.</p>
