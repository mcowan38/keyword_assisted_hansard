<p data-HoCid="7971452" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, we unequivocally condemn Hamas's terrorist attack against Israel and we support Israel's right to defend itself in accordance with international law. Of course, we are deeply concerned with the situation in Gaza. As I said, there are ongoing diplomatic conversations about consideration of humanitarian pauses, which is something that Canada supports. Desperately needed humanitarian aid must reach vulnerable Palestinian civilians at risk in Gaza. Canada is closely engaged with partners to build a humanitarian corridor. Hamas must release hostages, and we have to get foreign nationals, particularly Canadians, safely out of Gaza.</p>
