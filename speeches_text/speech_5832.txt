<p data-HoCid="8823667" data-originallang="en">The larger issue for us is pretend Indians taking economic opportunities, but not in the same senses as you've described. As I mentioned earlier, our community owns a number of businesses, and none of them require us to look for contracts through the procurement process. However, I know other companies that benefit greatly from the set-aside. In fact, my wife works for an indigenous company in Ottawa that absolutely benefits from the procurement strategy that exists. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8823668" data-originallang="en">The bigger challenge always is ensuring the legitimacy of companies that are able to register. As an example, our tribal council, the Algonquin Anishinabeg Nation Tribal Council, as you're probably aware, registered to become part of the procurement strategy, and when it came time to produce proof, they simply had to upload a picture of a rabbit, I believe, and there was no verification. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8823669" data-originallang="en"> The larger challenge is that this system is not monitored and there's nobody checking it on a regular basis to ensure that registered companies are legitimate indigenous companies for the purpose of benefiting from the procurement set-aside. </p>
