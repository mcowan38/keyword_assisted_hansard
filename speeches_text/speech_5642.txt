<p data-HoCid="8734961" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, it is time for Canada to recognize the state of Palestine. This Friday marks International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. For far too long, the Palestinian people have suffered being stateless. Canada has long supported a two-state solution. Canada took the first step toward diplomatic relations 30 years ago. Canada has a representative office in Ramallah; Palestine has a representative office in Ottawa. Time is past due to take the next step, to stand up for what is right. We must end this misery, preserve human rights and recognize the state of Palestine.</p>
