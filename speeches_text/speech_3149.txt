<p data-HoCid="8098548" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098549" data-originallang="en">Thank you, witnesses, for being here today, and for your testimony and expertise.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098550" data-originallang="en">In 2022, <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="MÃ©lanie Joly">Minister Joly</a> committed to transforming Global Affairs Canada to better serve Canadians amidst increasing global uncertainty. We're certainly seeing that around the world. There are increasing security crises and complex challenges we need to overcome.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098551" data-originallang="en">I want to start by thanking all those who work in Global Affairs Canada. Their dedication and commitment is really impressive, and I think all Canadians owe them a debt of gratitude.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098552" data-originallang="en">I want to focus on consular services because none of you touched on that. It's not just cases like the two Michaels, which are so public. We've recently seen hundreds of Canadians being evacuated from Israel and Gaza, but there are also less well-known cases that never make it into the newspapers.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098553" data-originallang="en"> I'm wondering, Ms. Welsh, if you could start, and then others may want to jump in. Where do you see us in terms of consular services, and how can we improve what we're doing there?</p>
