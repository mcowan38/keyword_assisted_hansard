<p data-HoCid="7988176" data-originallang="en"> Good morning, Mr. Chair and members of the committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988177" data-originallang="en">Thank you for the invitation to brief the committee today on recent events in Israel, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7988178" data-originallang="en">Developments are moving quite quickly. I will focus on how the conflict is evolving and on Canadian approaches, but I will avoid discussing hypothetical and future-oriented scenarios.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988179" data-originallang="fr">On October 7, 2023, the terrorist group Hamas launched a large-scale terrorist attack against Israel. Hamas brutally killed over 1,300 Israelis and kidnapped over 100 civilians. The attack shook Israel to the core. Canada and the whole world were stunned by the severity of the atrocities committed by Hamas against innocent men, women and children. We condemn these actions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988180" data-originallang="fr"> Israel and Hamas have been at war since October 7. Hamas has continued to indiscriminately launch rockets into Israeli territory. Israeli defence forces undertook a vast campaign of air strikes in the Gaza Strip, in expectation of a terrorist invasion. Israel's objective is to paralyze Hamas once and for all and prevent a new attack of this kind from ever happening again.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988181" data-originallang="fr">Canada is continuing to meet its commitments to its partners in the region and around the world.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988182" data-originallang="fr">We have underscored the fact that we support Israel's right under international law to defend itself against the terrorist acts of Hamas.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988183" data-originallang="fr">Moreover, as we have already stated publicly and privately, it's essential for Israel to be able to defend itself in compliance with rules established by international humanitarian law. The first such rule is the protection of civilians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988184" data-originallang="en"> The dire humanitarian situation in Gaza remains a significant concern for the Government of Canada. It is estimated that nearly 1.4 million Palestinians, including civilians, have been displaced from their homes in the past two weeks. There were reports, which we cannot independently verify, of more than 4,000 Palestinians killed, including civilians and children. It is imperative that humanitarian access be established so that life-saving assistance reaches civilians who need it most. The decision by Egypt and Israel to allow for initial deliveries of humanitarian assistance over the weekend is a positive first step, but it is clear that more must be done. Canadian officials will continue to call on all parties to ensure access of humanitarian aid to vulnerable Palestinians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988185" data-originallang="en">Canada remains one of the largest contributors of humanitarian and development assistance to vulnerable Palestinians, with an average spend of $55 million Canadian per year. Following <a data-HoCid="300012" href="/politicians/ahmed-hussen/" title="Ahmed Hussen">Minister Hussen</a>'s announcement on October 21, Canada's contributions to address the current crisis in Gaza stand at $60 million Canadian.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988186" data-originallang="en">All of our funding to support Palestinians goes through trusted partner organizations, such as UN agencies. We will support their efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance while ensuring that none of the funding goes into the hands of Hamas. Canada exercises enhanced due diligence for all humanitarian and development assistance funding for Palestinians. This effort includes systematic screening and strong anti-terrorism provisions in our funding agreements.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988187" data-originallang="en">It is critical here that we emphasize that Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people, nor their legitimate aspirations. Hamas is a listed terrorist entity. It has brutally murdered innocent civilians, has chosen to invade Israel and has taken hostages in total violation of all international laws and norms.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988188" data-originallang="en">Turning briefly to the broader region, it is essential that this conflict not become regionalized and spread to neighbouring areas. In this respect, Iran's rhetoric and support of Hamas, statements by the terrorist group Hezbollah, and the launching of rockets into and towards Israel and American forces by actors affiliated with Iran in Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen are all deeply concerning.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988189" data-originallang="fr">Canadian representatives at all levels are continuing to engage with our partners in the region and around the world in dealing with the situation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988190" data-originallang="fr">Canada remains determined to enforce international law and to support the rights of Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace and security.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988191" data-originallang="en">Canada will continue to support the right of the Israeli and Palestinian peoples to live in peace and security. We will continue to support a two-state solution as the only viable means to achieve this outcome.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988192" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
