<p data-HoCid="6799133" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, in recent weeks, I have been deeply disturbed by the rise of anti-Semitic acts in my community of York Centre and across Canada. We have seen Jewish businesses, synagogues and memorials vandalized, and Jewish Canadians have faced acts of violence and intimidation in our communities. These acts of hate have no place in Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6799134" data-originallang="en">Could the <a data-HoCid="253404" href="/politicians/bardish-chagger/" title="Bardish Chagger">Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth</a> please tell the House how our government is combatting anti-Semitism here in Canada today?</p>
