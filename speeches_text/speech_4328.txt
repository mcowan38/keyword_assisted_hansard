<p data-HoCid="8417175" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, with respect, the <a data-HoCid="299996" href="/politicians/arif-virani/" title="Arif Virani">minister</a> is been quite evasive. I am not talking about the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a>. I am not talking about Israeli settlements abroad. I am talking about Canadians who may have broken the law here in Canada regarding the purchase of properties in the occupied Palestinian territories being done here on Canadian soil. I would like a specific answer to that specific question. That is not under the purview of the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a>. That is under the purview of the <a data-HoCid="299999" href="/politicians/arif-virani/" title="Arif Virani">Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada</a>.</p>
