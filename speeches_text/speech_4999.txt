<p data-HoCid="8628401" data-originallang="en">I want to be very clear to all Canadians that this strategy is designed to support all Canadians who experience discrimination and racism, including Palestinian Canadians. That is very clear in the strategy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8628402" data-originallang="en">I think it's also important to recognize the fact that this strategy is meant to be evergreen. We never had a strategy. We put it forward in 2017, alongside community members, because we knew we needed to do this work. We then extensively met with community members across this country to talk about what more we can do to support communities. This came out of the two summits that our government held on combatting anti-Semitism and, of course, Islamophobia. We are obviously going to continue to listen to Canadians from all different backgrounds because we need to make sure that this is a policy that all Canadians can see themselves in. This is meant for every Canadian, including Palestinian Canadians.</p>
