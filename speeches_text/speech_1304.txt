<p data-HoCid="6911647" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> is certainly a passionate advocate every time she is on her feet in this House.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6911648" data-originallang="en">I have a number of seniors in my riding, including those I would consider vulnerable, and I am proud of the work our government has done. Let me address the question first as it relates to the GIS clawback. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6911649" data-originallang="en">The government, in the economic update, said that we absolutely will be addressing that issue. It is a $700-million measure that the government is putting forward. I hope the member opposite will be going back and telling her constituents that the government will do this. With regard to the timeline, I am not the <a data-HoCid="263831" href="/politicians/chrystia-freeland/" title="Chrystia Freeland">Minister of Finance</a>, but I am happy to say that I know this is a priority for our government, and it will be addressed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6911650" data-originallang="en">However, let us go back. On the old age security increase and guaranteed income supplement increase, we have increased the thresholds at which people have to start paying taxes, which also supports low-income seniors. The government is certainly proud of its record, and we have no reason to be disappointed, because we have been there for seniors throughout.</p>
