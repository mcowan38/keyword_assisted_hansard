<p data-HoCid="6975534" data-originallang="en">One challenge with the existing system is that there is no registry of how many internship programs are in operation. As part of that 50th anniversary program that Dr. Dance mentioned, I did research and tried to prepare a history of how the programs have operated and how they spread.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6975535" data-originallang="en"> At that time, I identified around 15 internship programs that were in operation. They could be divided into categories. Some were purely academic; some were run by advocacy organizations and some, like the parliamentary internship program or the Jaimie Anderson internship program, were operated by a specific external organization.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6975536" data-originallang="en">The number of internship opportunities has declined, so the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs program was shut down. There previously was a Canada-Poland youth internship program that ended. There was also the National Council on Canada-Arab Relations program that ended. Also, there was the parliamentary internship and mentoring program that was run by the Korean Canadian Scholarship Foundation, which has ended. Part of the trouble, though, is that I cannot attest that this was specifically due to this ruling. They were in operation and, so far as I know, are no longer continuing.</p>
