<p data-HoCid="6498462" data-originallang="fr">Let's talk about confidentiality, Minister. I have here the European Union's contract with AstraZeneca, Pfizer's contract with Israel and AstraZeneca's contract with the United States. The contract between AstraZeneca and the European Union clearly states that doses will be delivered monthly.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6498463" data-originallang="fr">How is it that I have access to all of those major contracts when I can't get any information on Canada's deals? Do you think it's normal for Quebec's health minister to lament the fact that he has no information about the contracts that were signed, during a press conference? Do you have an answer, yes or no?</p>
