<p data-HoCid="8301056" data-originallang="en">The proposal would expand the number of sessions from three to six, so that we can devote an equal amount of time to the rise of Islamophobia in Canada and provide leadership on opposing all forms of religious-based hatred in this country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301057" data-originallang="en"> The technical amendment has five parts. It would add “and Islamophobia” after each mention of anti-Semitism on line two. It would add “and” before “additional measures” on line three. It would replace the text on line four with “Canada's Jewish and Muslim communities.” It would add “and Islamophobia” after “antisemitism” on line five. Finally, it would replace the number of meetings from “three” to “six” on line seven.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301058" data-originallang="en">We have the final version as it would read. I think that's easier for people to deal with. It's really only adding the parallel study of Islamophobia to the study of anti-Semitism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301059" data-originallang="en">With that, I move my amendment, Madam Chair.</p>
