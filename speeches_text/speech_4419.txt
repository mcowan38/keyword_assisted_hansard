<p data-HoCid="8455631" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Miller, I'll turn to you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455632" data-originallang="fr">Of course, we understand the intention to combat antisemitism. Hate speech is unacceptable in Canada. But we also know that there are values we hold dear, such as freedom of opinion and expression. These values are in conflict in situations like the one we are discussing now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455633" data-originallang="fr">How can we strike a balance between freedom of opinion and expression and the fight against hate speech in the public arena?</p>
