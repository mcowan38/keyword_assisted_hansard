<p data-HoCid="8303199" data-originallang="fr">Just a few days ago, I would remind you that there was talk of a monument honouring this division of the Waffenâ€‘SS and located in a Ukrainian cemetery in Oakville. St. Volodymyr Cemetery has confirmed that this monument has been removed, in agreement with the Jewish community and the Ukrainian community. Even within the two communities, there's a realization that there's a historical problem surrounding this division.</p>
