<p data-HoCid="6885002" data-originallang="en"> Madam Speaker, I want to thank the <a data-HoCid="278925" href="/politicians/seamus-oregan/" title="Seamus O'Regan">minister</a>. I recognize this is a very unusual way to pass a private member's bill in a government bill. I was just telling my colleagues I could not find another example of this having been done in such a manner. I also want to say to the member for <a data-HoCid="278112" href="/politicians/sean-fraser/" title="Sean Fraser">Central Nova</a> that he is forgiven for drawing me as number 293 in the private member's bill draw as we were able to do this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6885003" data-originallang="en">There are a few members in the caucus who I want to recognize very quickly. Like me, they are parents who lost kids as well, the member for <a data-HoCid="278471" href="/politicians/ryan-williams/" title="Ryan Williams">Bay of Quinte</a>, the member for <a data-HoCid="278504" href="/politicians/kyle-seeback/" title="Kyle Seeback">Dufferin—Caledon</a>, the member for <a data-HoCid="278158" href="/politicians/james-bezan/" title="James Bezan">Selkirk—Interlake—Eastman</a> and the member for <a data-HoCid="278781" href="/politicians/marty-morantz/" title="Marty Morantz">Charleswood—St. James—Assiniboia—Headingley</a>. If I missed anyone, forgive me and come talk to me afterwards. As well, the <a data-HoCid="278908" href="/politicians/sean-fraser/" title="Sean Fraser">Minister of Immigration</a> lost a child, actually during the last Parliament, I believe. Then a former member, James Cumming lost his son, Garrett G-man Cumming, who passed away of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6885004" data-originallang="en"> I also want to recognize and thank the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278428" href="/politicians/gerard-deltell/" title="Gérard Deltell">Louis-Saint-Laurent</a>, our House leader, the Bloc House leader, the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278653" href="/politicians/alain-therrien/" title="Alain Therrien">La Prairie</a>, the <a data-HoCid="278913" href="/politicians/mark-holland/" title="Mark Holland">government House leader</a>, the House leaders of the other parties and independent members who agreed to this unanimous consent motion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6885005" data-originallang="fr">My colleagues know that bereavement leave for parents who have lost a child is very important to me. I lived through such a tragic event just before the Conservative Party convention in Halifax. It was really hard for my family and hard on my marriage at the time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6885006" data-originallang="fr">I hope that this law will serve as a model for the provinces. Once passed, it will only apply to federally regulated workers who fall under the Canada Labour Code. I hope that the provinces will be inspired by all these ideas and will include them in their own labour codes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6885007" data-originallang="fr">In addition, mothers and fathers will finally be equal. Over the past few decades, we have often talked about mothers who went through this. We must also think of the fathers who experienced this tragic loss. It is also just as important for children who lose a sister or a brother.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6885008" data-originallang="en">I also want to mention a few things. I returned to the House, it was about October 15, for the Infant Loss Awareness Day, to do a Standing Order 31 statement. I got really kind notes. I want to recognize Bill Morneau, the minister of finance at the time. He sent me a really kind note. He is the father of several very well-accomplished ladies. I want to recognize him for the note. I have actually kept the note. I want to recognize the current <a data-HoCid="278925" href="/politicians/seamus-oregan/" title="Seamus O'Regan">Minister of Labour</a>. He sent me a very kind note; I still have it in my desk. I hope it is okay I mention this. I kept that note since that time. I cannot say enough thanks to the House leaders for having done this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6885009" data-originallang="en"> I am speaking simply to the amendment. I have a Yiddish proverb, as I always do. I cannot help myself.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6885010" data-originallang="en">“If you want to make God laugh, tell him about your plans.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="6885011" data-originallang="en">Frankly, if anyone had told me back in 2015 that I would be tabling a private member's bill twice on bereavement leave for parents, moms and dads, I would have asked, “Why would I ever do such a thing? I am a fiscal guy. I love equalization. I love talking about numbers, foreign affairs issues, those types of things. Bereavement leave, miscarriage leave, Canada Labour Code leave is not what I would call in my bailiwick. It is not in my wheelhouse.” I made it my wheelhouse to try to get something done.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6885012" data-originallang="en">This is a beautiful Christmas gift to parents across Canada, and to myself as well. I want to say thank you. It is nice to know, and speaking as an optimist, a very cynical optimist, that politicians can come together sometimes and improve a government bill like this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6885013" data-originallang="en"> I wish you all a merry Christmas. <em>Joyeux Noël à tous.</em> Happy new year.</p>
