<p data-HoCid="8551282" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I want to start by sharing that I put my phone on airplane mode to make sure that, if any interference were to in, it would not impact the interpreters. I just wanted to put that on the record as we go through the process of ensuring that our interpreters can do the important work that they do. I am on airplane mode in the hope that there will be no feedback.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8551283" data-originallang="en"> I appreciate that we are back to debating Bill <a data-HoCid="13103731" href="/bills/44-1/C-71/" title="An Act to amend the Citizenship Act (2024)">C-71</a> and able to have this conversation. I was on House duty all day yesterday and had the privilege of being a part of the debate. Unfortunately our time came to an end, and I was looking forward to continuing that debate today. Having observed and listened to the emergency debate that took place last night, I was impressed with the calibre of the debate and the discussion taking place in the House of Commons. It demonstrates that we are able to rise above and do important work.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8551284" data-originallang="en"> Today, as I finish off my time, I want to come back to Bill <a data-HoCid="13103731" href="/bills/44-1/C-71/" title="An Act to amend the Citizenship Act (2024)">C-71</a> and the fact that this is legislation that has been introduced because the Ontario Superior Court of Justice has ruled that these individuals, also known as lost Canadians, are entitled to their citizenship. These are people who were always eligible for their citizenship but were under the previous Conservative government that advanced Bill <a data-HoCid="3188741" href="/bills/39-2/C-37/" title="An Act to amend the Citizenship Act">C-37</a>. At that time, there were many members in this place, of whom I was not one, but I did get to work closely with some of them. They had advised the Conservative government of the day that we could do better, saying that the legislation, yes, would correct some spaces and some issues, but there would be some people who would be left behind. They advised that they should do it right, but no, that is not the Conservative way. We saw some of those tactics again this morning. It is either the Conservative way, which is helping Conservatives, or, if we do not believe in the Conservative mentality or the Conservative mantra, we are not Canadian enough.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8551285" data-originallang="en">Here is breaking news for Conservatives: Conservatives do not get to determine who is and who is not a Canadian. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects our rights and freedom. People sacrificed their lives for us to be able to have these rights and freedoms and with rights and freedoms come responsibilities. As the Ontario Superior Court of Justice ruled, Bill <a data-HoCid="3188741" href="/bills/39-2/C-37/" title="An Act to amend the Citizenship Act">C-37</a>, which former prime minister Harper and the Conservative government of the day passed, was unconstitutional. The Superior Court of Justice primarily named mobility rights, as people have the right to come and go, and equality rights, namely women's rights, as they are rights and freedoms that are protected in our country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8551286" data-originallang="en"> I am not going to go down the rabbit hole of why Conservatives do not support women and the fact that they are constantly trying to threaten a woman's right to choose, along with all these battles we have already had. </p>
