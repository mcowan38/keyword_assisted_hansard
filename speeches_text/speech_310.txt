<p data-HoCid="6319921" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I felt very compelled today to rise and share what a deep honour and privilege it is to serve beside the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="253019" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>. Her existence in this space is an act of resistance. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6319922" data-originallang="en">In her sharing today, she talked about the importance of land and every child becoming an adult and working through their traumas. I am wondering if the hon. member could expound on the connection between the dispossession of land and the apprehension of children as it relates to her experience and those of indigenous peoples from Turtle Island all the way to Palestine.</p>
