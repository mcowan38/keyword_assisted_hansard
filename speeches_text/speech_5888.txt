<p data-HoCid="8823377" data-originallang="en">It's a yes or no. I have a friend who is a heart surgeon and teaches heart surgery at the U of T. He was walking to work. He was prevented from going to work at the U of T campus to teach young, aspiring doctors. Do you know why? It was because he was Jewish. No one from government stood up and spoke out for that man, and others like him, just trying to go to work and teach our young doctors how to treat hearts. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8823378" data-originallang="en">Is that acceptable?</p>
