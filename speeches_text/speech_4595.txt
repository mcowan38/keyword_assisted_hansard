<p data-HoCid="8499247" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Emon, I'm sorry to interrupt. I know it's very rude and I hate to do it, but as you know, we're limited to six minutes each. I've already used up more than four minutes of my time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8499248" data-originallang="fr">I understand the financial issue, but do you feel that something should be done to curb hate against the Jewish community, something that would also be useful in curbing hate against the Muslim community? In our fight against all forms of hatred based on religion, race, gender, sexual orientation or anything else, do you feel that something tangible should be done?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8499249" data-originallang="fr">We have a minute and a half left.</p>
