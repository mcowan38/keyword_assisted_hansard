<p data-HoCid="8672580" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, I will simply try to bring forward a bit of levity and take advantage of the comments component as opposed to a question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8672581" data-originallang="en"> I have two things to say. First, I thought that the member did a good job of using his own words. I enjoyed hearing discussion that was not manufactured by Conservative staff on a variety of different things. Second, in all honesty, I heard a lot of references from another colleague to Yiddish proverbs earlier, so I thought I would offer my colleague vocabulary that he could introduce into a future speech.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8672582" data-originallang="en"> The member referenced Liberal backsides, so I thought I would tap into the former educator in me to teach him a word. The Yiddish word for backside is “tuchus”, so I hope that the word tuchus will find its way into the future remarks of my hon. colleague across the way.</p>
