<p data-HoCid="8479590" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479591" data-originallang="en">I want to thank all of our witnesses for being here today. For those of you who have experienced the loss of your loved ones, I want to add my personal condolences as well.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479592" data-originallang="en">I was really struck by what Omar Babili talked about. He talked about the impact when his church was attacked. Local politicians really did nothing. It resonated with me, because we've had a hundred Christian churches in this country torched, and the Liberal government has said and done nothing. On the anti-Semitism study that we're just finishing up, we heard about the 500% increase in anti-Semitic hate events. Others felt as well that the federal government had not adequately acted.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479593" data-originallang="en">I'm interested in hearing about Islamophobia, because since 2017, there's been a House of Commons study on Islamophobia, which brought forward 16 recommendations; the Senate report that was mentioned, which made 60 recommendations on what the government could do; and a national summit in Canada on Islamophobia. The government also put a special representative in place to combat Islamophobia.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479594" data-originallang="en">With all of that, Omar, do you feel that the efforts of the federal government have decreased Islamophobia in Canada?</p>
