<p data-HoCid="7957607" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague for his speech. This does not happen often, but for once, we are in agreement. The members of Hamas are terrorists. Hamas is seeking the annihilation of Israel. Hamas is evil. We all agree on that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957608" data-originallang="fr">However, does the fact that these terrorists want to cause harm and the annihilation of Israel justify any action that will affect the entire Palestinian people?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957609" data-originallang="fr">Is my colleague for or against the establishment of a humanitarian corridor? </p>
