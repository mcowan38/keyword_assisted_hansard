<p data-HoCid="8448590" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, today I rise to salute, for their big dream and optimistic outlook, the wonderful, passionate CPA High students who make up the Cheetahs for Change. Formed in 2020 with the guidance of their teacher Madame Yelena Smith, the Cheetahs' mission is to build a positive, inclusive culture at their school.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8448591" data-originallang="en">They have done this by hosting guest speakers and organizing workshops about mental health, racism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, homophobia and transphobia. They foster civic participation by holding Remembrance Day ceremonies and local election debates, both of which I have been honoured to join. In all they do, the Cheetahs emphasize students' commonalities over differences. Their motto is “I am because you are—because it takes a village.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8448592" data-originallang="en">I say thank you to all the Cheetahs.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8448593" data-originallang="fr"> It is a great start to their future.</p>
