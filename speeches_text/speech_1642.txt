<p data-HoCid="7146154" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7146155" data-originallang="en">We will begin, of course, with the eye-witness accounts of what happened. That is always a traditional method of proving cases in court.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7146156" data-originallang="en">We don't leave it only at that. Nuremberg, which prosecuted the Holocaust and war crimes that were committed during the Second World War, was heavily reliant on documentary evidence to establish the case. That is another way of proving things. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7146157" data-originallang="en">Since Nuremberg, things have moved a long way. We now have a lot of technology. James Stewart used to work in an office that had all those gadgets to sneak out what people are doing and that sort of stuff. They can use technology nowadays and things have really moved forward.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7146158" data-originallang="en">There are all sorts of programs. I know the university of Berkeley has some programs that track human rights violations in circumstances like this and others. There are different sources of evidence that could be pulled into the court to make a case. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7146159" data-originallang="en">James, maybe you can come in here. I used to be a judge until recently and James remained a prosecutor.</p>
