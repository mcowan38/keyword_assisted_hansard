<p data-HoCid="6998403" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I rise today to sadly inform the House that Hamilton lost a much-admired journalist this week. Steve Arnold was known for his unquenchable curiosity, gentle demeanour and profound intellect. For more than half of his 40-year journalism career, he was a business reporter at the Hamilton Spectator, delving deeply into Hamilton's business, manufacturing and labour sectors.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6998404" data-originallang="en">For many of those years, Steve lived in my riding of Hamilton Mountain, and his work was consistently meaningful for my constituents in the steel and manufacturing sectors.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6998405" data-originallang="en"> I got to know Steve as a colleague at the Hamilton Spectator. Years after I moved to broadcasting, he continued to offer advice and support, because he was someone who was always generous with his time and knowledge.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6998406" data-originallang="en">When he retired, he never really retired, because journalism was never a job for Steve Arnold. It was a calling. He continued to write for community papers and the Canadian Jewish News.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6998407" data-originallang="en"> Today, I offer my sincerest condolences to his wife, Pam, his friends, his family and all those whose lives were touched by his words.</p>
