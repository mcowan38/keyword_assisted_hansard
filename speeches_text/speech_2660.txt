<p data-HoCid="7957768" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I know my colleague cares deeply about his constituents and the community.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957769" data-originallang="en">Like him, I have been hearing horrific tales and stories about people. The mother of one of my colleagues was speaking Urdu, and my colleague had to tell her mom to stop speaking that and to go home, because she was so worried there would be violence perpetrated against her. The entire Jewish community is afraid. The entire Palestinian community is afraid. I am deeply worried that there is going to be an increase in violence in this country, that we are going to see an increase in hate crimes and that people are going to get harmed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957770" data-originallang="en">I wonder if the member could talk about how he sees his government taking action on this and what can be done to protect people.</p>
