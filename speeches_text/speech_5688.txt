<p data-HoCid="8776431" data-originallang="en">Thank you. I'm just trying to write this down. I believe, if I'm correct, that it's removed the priority, the part where it says that “the committee immediately prioritize a study”. Then it cuts it down from eight meetings to four and expands it beyond only violent anti-Semitism to violent extremism, with a focus or emphasis, perhaps, on anti-Semitism. However, it's been expanded beyond that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8776432" data-originallang="en">If Ms. Damoff can just confirm that my three points are correct, I would then just like to respond.</p>
