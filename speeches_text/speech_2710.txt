<p data-HoCid="7957392" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, I would like to thank my colleague for her intervention.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957393" data-originallang="en">We have spoken before in this place about the impact that anti-Semitism has had on the member, her family and her community, and I know that we are seeing a rise in that across the country. I also know that we are seeing anti-Palestinian hate happening across this country. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7957394" data-originallang="en">I spoke to a colleague today who said that she is worried about her mother who sometimes speaks Urdu in public and has told her that she has to stay home. I have spoken to other people who have said that because their sisters are wearing a hijab, they are going to go home and protect them as they are worried about them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957395" data-originallang="en">Perhaps the member could talk a little bit about what more we could do as Canadians, as a country, to come together to protect against the anti-Semitism and anti-Palestinian hate we are seeing, which is on the rise across this country. </p>
