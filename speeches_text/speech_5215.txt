The fact that 146 states, including many of our EU member allies, have recognized Palestine acknowledges that difference. We all understand that the final status issues of Jerusalem—refugees, borders, security—have to be negotiated. The problem is that the Netanyahu government, for over 17 years, has essentially refused to negotiate. We can't allow that to continue. You can't have a negotiation with one side only.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679146" data-originallang="en">I agree that there have been previous efforts to negotiate a two-state solution and they failed, but that doesn't mean that we give up now and that we never try again. It's essential that we do try again, with a firm commitment on both sides to that reality.</p>
