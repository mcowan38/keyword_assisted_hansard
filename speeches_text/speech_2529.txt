<p data-HoCid="7931180" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, B'nai Brith, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, and the Jewish community are all demanding an apology from the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> for allowing a Nazi veteran of the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS to be honoured on the floor of the House of Commons.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7931181" data-originallang="en">This was an appalling error in judgment on the part of the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, whose diplomatic protocol office has massive resources for vetting all guests invited to this place. Only Liberals had the opportunity to vet this individual's past. Allowing a Waffen-SS Nazi to be honoured in this place has embarrassed Canada on the international stage, embarrassed President Zelenskyy, caused a diplomatic disaster and handed the Kremlin and its illegal invasion a propaganda win.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7931182" data-originallang="en">The <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> has brought shame on the House, emboldened the Russians and deeply offended the Jewish community. Will he stand in the House today, finally take responsibility, get up on his feet, do the right thing and apologize?</p>
