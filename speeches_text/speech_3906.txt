<p data-HoCid="8309952" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8309953" data-originallang="fr">I'd also like to thank the witnesses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8309954" data-originallang="fr">Obviously, this is a crisis, a tragedy. It's a real shame.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8309955" data-originallang="fr">I want to thank Ms. Gazan for bringing this study to the committee. I think we should have two or three more meetings, because we need more time to hear from witnesses. We heard at the previous meeting about the senior officials responsible for emergency management. I think the committee should invite the federal representative of that organization, as well as the president who represents the 10 provinces and three territories.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8309956" data-originallang="fr">Earlier, Ms. Cooper talked about the models of the alert system. Quebec, for example, has insisted on having SILVER alerts, particularly for finding people with dementia.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8309957" data-originallang="fr">Why can't the federal government or a province add a red dress alert to its national system? I don't understand why it hasn't been done yet.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8309958" data-originallang="en"> Ms. Savoy, what would you have to say to the SOREM committee right now, nationally? Why have they not included murdered indigenous women as missing in the alert system? Why has that not happened?</p>
