<p data-HoCid="8435156" data-originallang="en">On the encampment that is presently active in the University of Waterloo, my administration, addressing the protesters' calls.... I'll read to you if I may, just briefly. This is a public communication. They are dialoguing with protesters about their demands for “divestment from companies...and complete severance from any academic or cultural institutional ties with Israeli institutions”. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8435157" data-originallang="en">This is quite incredible to me. On freedom of expression, they're fine. I'm fine with that, but freedom of expression doesn't mean that I need to listen to your expression. To divest from Israeli academic institutions—citing what you just mentioned, things like the ICJ or the ICC—in supporting these demands would lead to suppression of academic freedom, particularly targeting Jewish academics, particularly targeting Jewish academic institutions.</p>
