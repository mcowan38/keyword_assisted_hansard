<p data-HoCid="8576462" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I want to start by sharing how much I agree with the member for <a data-HoCid="278408" href="/politicians/michael-chong/" title="Michael Chong">Wellington—Halton Hills</a> on the importance of the rules-based order. I appreciate his focus on international humanitarian law, and I agree with him on condemning Hamas for its terrorist attack of October 7. However, my question to him is about all parties following international humanitarian law. He was looking for examples earlier, and I will cite some for him. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8576463" data-originallang="en">From Amnesty International, January 2019: “Israel's policy of settling its civilians in occupied Palestinian territory and displacing the local population contravenes fundamental rules of international humanitarian law.” That was prior to October 7. If the member is looking for post-October 7, on January 26, the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to take six actions to prevent acts of genocide. Clearly, we would agree that is against international humanitarian law.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576464" data-originallang="en">Is the member going to call for international humanitarian law to be followed by all parties or only some?</p>
