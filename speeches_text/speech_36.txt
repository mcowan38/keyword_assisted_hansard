<p data-HoCid="6031332" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, this Liberal government remains committed to a goal of comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East. That includes the creation of the Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with Israel that is secure within its own borders.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6031333" data-originallang="en"> We recognize the need to renew efforts toward a negotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We have long maintained that peace can only be achieved through direct negotiation between the parties. We are always ready to support dialogue between the parties toward a negotiated and viable two-state solution.</p>
