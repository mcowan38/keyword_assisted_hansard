<p data-HoCid="8576910" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, here is what I know is not up for debate. The terrorist regime in Tehran has said death to all Jews; end to the state of Israel. That sounds like a genocidal intent to me. Then you have Hamas, which also said death to all Jews and then it decided to kill a few thousand Jews. Then it said, no, we still want to kill more Jews and we do not want Israel to exist. Their supporters, including those here in Canada, mourn. They are out there essentially saying that what happened on October 7 is justified. To me, that is genocidal activity. That is what this place needs to be concerned with, and we need to support Israel and its right to defend itself.</p>
