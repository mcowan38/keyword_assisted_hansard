The Chair addressed the similarity between Bill <a data-HoCid="12260850" href="/bills/44-1/C-323/" title="An Act to amend the Excise Tax Act (mental health services)">C-323</a> and Bill <a data-HoCid="12739107" href="/bills/44-1/C-59/" title="An Act to implement certain provisions of the fall economic statement tabled in Parliament on November 21, 2023 and certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on March 28, 2023">C-59</a>, an act to implement certain provisions of the fall economic statement tabled in Parliament on November 21, 2023, and certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on March 28, 2023.</p>

<p data-HoCid="8465115" data-originallang="en">As explained in a ruling regarding Bill <a data-HoCid="11535416" href="/bills/44-1/C-250/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (prohibition — promotion of antisemitism)">C-250</a> of May 11, 2022, which can be found on page 5123 of the debates:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8465116" data-originallang="en"> The House should not face a situation where the same question can be cited twice within the same session, unless the House's intention is to rescind or revoke the decision. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8465117" data-originallang="en"> Government and private members' bills belong to different categories of items and are governed by different sets of rules and precedents. Standing Order 94(1) provides the Speaker with the authority to “make all arrangements necessary to ensure the orderly conduct of Private Members' Business”. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8465118" data-originallang="fr">The House passed Bill <a data-HoCid="12739107" href="/bills/44-1/C-59/" title="An Act to implement certain provisions of the fall economic statement tabled in Parliament on November 21, 2023 and certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on March 28, 2023">C‑59</a> at third reading and sent it to the Senate on May 28, 2024. To comply with the principle that the House should not face a situation where the same question can be cited twice within the same session, the Chair may not put the question on the motion for third reading of Bill C‑323 unless, of course, the House takes other measures to substantially amend the bill before that stage is reached. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8465119" data-originallang="en">For now, the Chair will give the House the opportunity to do so and allow the member for <a data-HoCid="278126" href="/politicians/stephen-ellis/" title="Stephen Ellis">Cumberland—Colchester</a> to move the motion for third reading of Bill <a data-HoCid="12260850" href="/bills/44-1/C-323/" title="An Act to amend the Excise Tax Act (mental health services)">C-323</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8465120" data-originallang="fr">If no changes are made to Bill C‑323, the Chair will delay the vote on the bill at third reading until the process surrounding Bill C‑59 has been completed by the Senate. If Bill C‑59 is passed by the Senate and Bill C‑323 is still in its current form when the time comes for the question to be put on the motion for third reading, the House will not be able to vote on it.</p>
