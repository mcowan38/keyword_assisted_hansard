<p data-HoCid="6756568" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, in 2017, a petition signed by 15,000 Canadians called on the Government of Canada to achieve the release and return of two Israeli bodies held by the Hamas terror regime in Gaza. Now today, as the minister mentioned, Egypt is attempting, at very long odds, to achieve a lasting and durable truce between Hamas and Israel. Canada has just committed $25 million in aid to Gaza.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6756569" data-originallang="en">As the <a data-HoCid="271244" href="/politicians/marc-garneau/" title="Marc Garneau">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> is the one who is dealing with the Egyptian initiative, might it not now be appropriate to make this financial assistance conditional on the return of those two Israeli bodies and two other Israeli captives?</p>
