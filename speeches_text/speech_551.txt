<p data-HoCid="6476393" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much, Ms. Stevens.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6476394" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Ms. Gazan.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6476395" data-originallang="en">Colleagues, we're about five minutes from the appointed hour and we have a bit of committee business to deal with. I regret having to cut the questions so short, but if we're going to stay on time, that's what we need to do. My apologies to Mr. Kent, Mr. Turnbull and the others who were in the queue. We did have some technical difficulties and your chair is a bit rusty in terms of keeping people on schedule, so I bear some of the responsibility for this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6476396" data-originallang="en">To our witnesses, thank you so much. As you can tell, there's a great deal of interest and probably appetite for further questions and conversation, and we're grateful to you for being with us. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6476397" data-originallang="en">Ms. Jibb, you've done an admirable job in carrying the load of two. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6476398" data-originallang="en">Once again, thanks for what you do. Thank you for being with us. Your testimony will be of great assistance to us as we wrap up this study. I wish you a good evening.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6476399" data-originallang="en">Colleagues, please stand by. There are a couple of things in terms of the upcoming meetings. I don't think they're going to take very long.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6476400" data-originallang="en">For Thursday, we will have another full panel of witnesses in connection with the study we're doing now, but you will recall that one of the things we did at the outset of this study was to invite the Parliamentary Budget Officer. We accepted or moved certain terms of reference for the Parliamentary Budget Officer. Regarding the timeline we set for the PBO to submit a report, the PBO has asked for an extension. The extension they've asked for is until February 11. They will be able to come before the committee on February 16, which is the first meeting after the break week. They're going to provide the committee with an embargoed version of their report on February 10, and they want to have permission to hold a briefing on February 11 with the departments that provided data for the report. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6476401" data-originallang="en">I think what I require off the hop is a motion from someone to extend the time for receipt of the report from the Parliamentary Budget Officer to February 10, and that the PBO appear on February 16. Would someone please bring forward that motion? Then we'll open the floor for discussion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6476402" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Vaughan.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6476403" data-originallang="en">Is there any discussion?</p>
