<p data-HoCid="7089445" data-originallang="en">We did look at enforcement in other jurisdictions. Many other countries required their travellers to quarantine in government-approved hotels. Travellers were generally expected to stay in their rooms at these facilities for the duration of their quarantine, and they were not allowed to be mixing with other guests. Generally, they were required to stay there for the total duration of their quarantine, not just the three days—not just the initial first days after arriving in Canada—that was unique to the Canadian program.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7089446" data-originallang="en">We looked at PHAC requirements, and they based them on a pilot study they had done on the incidence of positive tests among air travellers entering Canada. Other countries that we looked at included the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Israel, Singapore and Norway. They had greater success in keeping track of their travellers, and that could have been attributed to the travellers having to stay at the hotels longer. </p>
