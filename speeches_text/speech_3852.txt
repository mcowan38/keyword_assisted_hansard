<p data-HoCid="8340298" data-originallang="en">I think it's important at this point to even take it out a little bit further and to remind people, as part of the historical context, that Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany. However, on September 17, it was invaded from the east by the Soviet Union. That's a fact that's often forgotten. Once Poland was forced to surrender, a lot of Polish soldiers and other volunteers joined one of the largest World War II undergrounds—if not the largest—the Polish Home Army, which fought Nazi German occupation and helped save Jews from the Holocaust. Jan Karski voluntarily went into Auschwitz to report back to the Allies about what was going on there. Then, after the war.... Even during the war, you still had the Warsaw Uprising, which was the, kind of, last effort of freedom-minded Poles to free Warsaw before the Soviet Army came in so that some measure of Polish freedom could be maintained—and then after the war.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8340299" data-originallang="en">Poles did not have any large-scale collaboration with either the Nazi German or Soviet regimes. In fact, they resisted both right up until 1989 when Poland finally became free after so many years of Soviet domination.</p>
