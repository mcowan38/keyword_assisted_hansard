<p data-HoCid="8693749" data-originallang="en">The question is framed as, “It is not possible”. We heard from the previous speakers as well that this kind of persuasion has built up since the withdrawal from Lebanon. Lebanon brought us Hezbollah, and then Hamas in Gaza. We shouldn't forget that after multiple Netanyahu governments in Israel, the idea that it's possible to create a peaceful state in Palestine has thinned out to nothing, so the question you're asking is not the one being asked when people are polled.</p>
