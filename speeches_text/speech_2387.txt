<p data-HoCid="7836046" data-originallang="en">Your mandate letter also mentions that you need to do work to support faith-based communities across the country. We have seen more than 68 Christian churches burned to the ground, vandalized or desecrated here in Canada, as well as many Jewish synagogues, some mosques and other religious places of worship.</p>
