<p data-HoCid="8281120" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, I have a very short question for the member. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8281121" data-originallang="en">He just talked about how he is deeply worried about the children who have been stolen by Russia, and I understand that, because for me, that is one thing that makes it very clear there is a genocide happening against the Ukrainian people. However, I wonder why he is not able to see that the 13 innocent children who have been killed in Gaza or the children who have died in other places around the world matter just as much. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8281122" data-originallang="en">For me, a child is a child is a child. I look at every single child and I think about their human rights and why they deserve to be reunited with their families, why they deserve to live and why they deserve to thrive. I wonder why he feels that Palestinian children are Hamas instead of just children.</p>
