<p data-HoCid="6944618" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the lack of an apology from that <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> speaks volumes. I have given the Prime Minister an opportunity to retract a shameful remark, where he would accuse any hon. member of this House to stand with a swastika.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6944619" data-originallang="en">As I said before, we have colleagues who are descendants of victims of the Holocaust. I am giving the Prime Minister one more chance. Will he apologize to all members of the House?</p>
