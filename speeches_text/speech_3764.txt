<p data-HoCid="8281173" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Chair, I would just like clarification, because this could set a regrettable precedent.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8281174" data-originallang="fr">If any member of this Parliament told NDP members that they are pro-Palestinian, would that member be silenced and accused of using unparliamentary language? If any one of us told other members that they are pro-Israeli, would that be cause for expulsion?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8281175" data-originallang="fr">We need to be careful about using ideologies. I certainly understand that, but sometimes we have to take controversial positions. Some members of the Conservative Party may have controversial views; indeed, one might say that some of them are pro-life and others are pro-choice.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8281176" data-originallang="fr">We would be playing a very dangerous game if we were to expel MPs for saying things that align with ideological leanings expressed in the House.</p>
