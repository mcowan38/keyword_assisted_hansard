<p data-HoCid="8455584" data-originallang="en"> Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455585" data-originallang="en"> I'm going to move on to Mr. Miller from Universities Canada. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8455586" data-originallang="en">You mentioned in your opening testimony, and Mr. Sandler has also referred to it, the importance of a code of conduct and adopting the IHRA definition of what anti-Semitism is. Is that a universally accepted statement across all your universities? </p>
<p data-HoCid="8455587" data-originallang="en">I ask that question in the context of something I read in The New York Times, where the authorities at Columbia University are saying that it is not their job to define anti-Semitism, that it is their job to listen to students. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8455588" data-originallang="en">In that context, what are your comments?</p>
