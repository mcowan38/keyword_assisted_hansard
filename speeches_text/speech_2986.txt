<p data-HoCid="8003934" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8003935" data-originallang="en">I'll read the exact wording of the the subamendment:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8003936" data-originallang="en"> That the committee invite Rachel Curran, head of public policy, Meta Canada to come before the committee and summon the President of the CBC, Catherine Tait to appear for 2 hours by herself within seven days of the motion being adopted, </p>
<p data-HoCid="8003937" data-originallang="en"> invite the CBC Director of Journalistic Standards, George Achi and the CBC ombudsman Jack Nagler, to appear separately for a minimum of an hour and a half each, to address the CBC's position on Journalistic Standards and Practices. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8003938" data-originallang="en">One of those journalistic standards and practices is that they refused to call Hamas a terrorist organization. This is despite the fact that Hamas has been listed by Canada as a terrorist organization since 2002. That's more than 20 years.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8003939" data-originallang="en">For the CBC to make this decision is absolutely irresponsible. It is to peddle disinformation. It is to be on the side of Hamas, which is to be on the side of terrorists, which is to be against the Jewish population, which is wrong.</p>
