<p data-HoCid="8453853" data-originallang="fr">You may or may not agree with me, but some of those concrete things Canada can do pertain to weapons sales. When new hostilities broke out recently between Azerbaijan and Armenia, Canada suspended its weapons and technology sales to Turkey. Over the past few months, the Bloc Québécois has been requesting that, in compliance with Canadian legislation on weapons sales, evidence be provided that Canadian weapons and technology are not being used by Israeli military forces against Palestinian civilians. In the meantime, all such sales should be suspended.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8453854" data-originallang="fr">The announcement that non-lethal equipment, but not lethal equipment, would continue to be sold, was favourably received. But the fact is that equipment like night-vision goggles and guided observation drones could become lethal.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8453855" data-originallang="fr">Can you confirm that sales of all such indirect weapons that could end up killing civilians will be suspended for as long as this conflict lasts, assuming that it will end one day, of course?</p>
