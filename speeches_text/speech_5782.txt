<p data-HoCid="8789429" data-originallang="en">This is a really important program. It was so successful last year in terms of the uptake by community leadership that we made some important modifications to the community security infrastructure program and brought them forward in the new Canadian community security program. There are some important changes that have been made, in particular to enable us to support communities if they need to hire security guards, for example. We have had a really impressive reaction to this program.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8789430" data-originallang="en"> I will say that it's unfortunate that it is required. The fact that anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and these types of issues are on the rise in Canada is deeply concerning to our department and to everyone in our portfolio agencies. We put in place these types of measures in order to be able to support the communities that most need them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8789431" data-originallang="en"> In addition, you did flag our Canada Centre. We do some really important prevention research, and we provide funding to key community leaders to work on prevention of these types of actions in the first place and to reduce the type of radicalization to violence that concerns our communities.</p>
