<p data-HoCid="8000179" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8000180" data-originallang="en">Thank you to the committee for allowing me this opportunity.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8000181" data-originallang="en">Because Canada was not in a position to fill some of the void created with Russia's invasion, or chose not to, sources then were secured from Qatar, Venezuela and other places. Obviously I think we all know the geopolitical risk that's associated there, particularly now with Hamas's actions in Israel, etc., and the risks that could increase there. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8000182" data-originallang="en">Professor Winfield, I'm going to go back to your opening statement. If I heard you correctly, you stated that when Europe continues its path or goes back to its decarbonization process, there was no geopolitical risk in that process. I want to challenge that statement.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8000183" data-originallang="en">Obviously, you've identified nuclear. EV would be part of that whole transition. Where are those critical minerals coming from? Is there no geopolitical risk in sourcing them from Africa or other places? I find that statement lacks a bit of credibility.</p>
