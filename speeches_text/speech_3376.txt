<p data-HoCid="8173010" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8173011" data-originallang="fr">I think we are all encouraged to vote in favour of Bill <a data-HoCid="12260777" href="/bills/44-1/C-318/" title="An Act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and the Canada Labour Code (adoptive and intended parents)">C-318</a>, which fundamentally seeks to recognize the equity between adoptive and biological parents. I don't think this is the only inequity in the EI system that we need to address, but that's another issue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8173012" data-originallang="fr">That goes without saying. Adoptive parents, in particular, have testified very accurately about what an adoption can mean. I must say that I am quite proud because this has been done in Quebec since 2021.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8173013" data-originallang="fr">In all fairness, we shouldn't have any reservations about passing this bill. I also agree with the amendments proposed by Ms. Gazan of the NDP. Beyond all the studies that will have to be done, the purpose of these amendments, according to the principle of the bill, is to take into account the culture based on the group's customs and traditions, as well as the children who are being placed who are not with their parents. I think that's the spirit of the wording. This can indeed lead to recognition so that, according to customs and traditions, those who welcome a child can benefit from the benefits we are about to adopt.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8173014" data-originallang="fr">I think it's a matter of principle. I think it is well worded in each of the provisions where it is necessary. I completely agree with that. I don't think another meeting is required to weigh the pros and cons.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8173015" data-originallang="fr">I urge us to vote in favour of this amendment.</p>
