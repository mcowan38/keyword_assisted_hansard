<p data-HoCid="7001557" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7001558" data-originallang="en">I'm excited to be part of the committee. I'm looking forward to working across all party lines and hopefully doing it transparently and out in the open.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7001559" data-originallang="en">I do want to give notice of a motion for the consideration of committee:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7001560" data-originallang="en"> That the committee immediately undertake a study of at least four meetings on the leak and misuse of personal data from crowd fundraising websites, and how the Canadian government can work to reduce these risks in the future; and that the first witness invited before the committee be the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7001561" data-originallang="en">I put that on notice.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7001562" data-originallang="en">I appreciate both Dr. Geist and Mr. Charbonneau for their comments today. I am very concerned about how data has been collected and how it could violate Canadians' privacy. The lack of transparency from the government and the concerns that have been raised by the Privacy Commissioner are troubling to all of us.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7001563" data-originallang="en">Dr. Geist, I read an article that you wrote in March 2020, at the very beginning of COVID. You also had a Globe and Mail op-ed. You mention standards and practices. You're talking today about the EU. You're also talking about how Israel and Taiwan are better at having those guardrails and transparency. Really, it comes down to the matter of trust, as Mr. Charbonneau was saying.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7001564" data-originallang="en">Do you believe there are enough guardrails in place, especially when you take a look at how long this data should be allowed to be held by organizations like BlueDot or by the Public Health Agency of Canada? I know you suggested in the past something like 14 days. Do we believe the government, through PHAC and BlueDot, is holding that information only for 14 days and then getting rid of it? Are they doing their analysis and moving on to help inform public information and public policy?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7001565" data-originallang="en">More importantly, how do we ensure that regulatory boundaries are in place that will, at the end of the day, protect the privacy of Canadians?</p>
