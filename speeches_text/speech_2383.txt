<p data-HoCid="7791208" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, it is shameful how misinformation is being peddled by the leader of the Conservative Party.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7791209" data-originallang="en">Last week, when the <a data-HoCid="278909" href="/politicians/karina-gould/" title="Karina Gould">Minister of Families, Children and Social Development</a> spoke of the horrible wildfires in Alberta, the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, the member of Parliament for <a data-HoCid="278241" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">Carleton</a>, yelled across the aisle, “Started by your government”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7791210" data-originallang="en">The former leader of the Conservative Party of Canada said not that long ago that it seemed as though of his party had gone a little too far down the rabbit hole of conspiracy theories during the pandemic, referring to comments by some of MPs as being not helpful and spreading a lot of uncertainty. Sadly, it seems that the member for Carleton is doing the same thing. He is spreading distrust and fact-free conspiracy rhetoric with respect to the deadly opioid epidemic.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7791211" data-originallang="en">This week, when the <a data-HoCid="278900" href="/politicians/carolyn-bennett/" title="Carolyn Bennett">Minister of Mental Health and Addictions</a>, a physician, was standing up for science and an evidence-based approach to saving lives with harm reduction, supervised consumption and safe supply, the leader of the Conservative Party aggressively repeated that she was killing people. This is to a doctor who has taken the Hippocratic oath.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7791212" data-originallang="en">It is beyond the pale. Canadians deserve honest representation and leadership. I would say the leader of the Conservative Party should be ashamed of himself, but it is clear that he has no shame.</p>
