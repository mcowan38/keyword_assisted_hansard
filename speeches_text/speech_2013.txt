<p data-HoCid="7444265" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, today we learned about a cowardly, heinous terrorist attack in Jerusalem, where 19 innocent civilians were injured and a 16-year-old Canadian boy was murdered. His name was Aryeh Shchupak, and may his memory be a blessing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7444266" data-originallang="en">Two coordinated terrorist bombings evoke painful memories of the deadly second intifada. It is chilling to think that there are terrorists celebrating this attack on civilians, casually chanting in the streets and online and calling for a third. Canadians should ask themselves why there are celebrations and treats being handed out in parts of the Gaza Strip when innocent civilians are murdered.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7444267" data-originallang="en">The government must take an unequivocal stand against terror everywhere and condemn this attack for what it is: hate-fuelled terror to kill Jews. They murdered a Canadian.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7444268" data-originallang="en">I hope that every member of the House will join me in condemning this attack and standing with Israel to protect our foundational principles, the ones we all hold dear.</p>
