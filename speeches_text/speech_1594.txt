<p data-HoCid="7064545" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I come to you today from the beautiful riding of Calgary Midnapore.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7064546" data-originallang="en">Further back, I asked the <a data-HoCid="263831" href="/politicians/chrystia-freeland/" title="Chrystia Freeland">finance minister</a> to stop pretending to convince Canadians that all was well with the economy. What she does not seem to understand still is that the majority of Canadians simply do not see it that way.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7064547" data-originallang="en">What Canadians do see is that their families cannot afford the same groceries that they used to, and that they will have to squeak in just one more trip back and forth to pick up the kids from school before having to buy another tank of gas. Canadians are looking to the government to provide solutions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7064548" data-originallang="en">Sixty-eight per cent of Canadians are concerned that they may not be able to afford gasoline, and 60% of Canadians are concerned they might not have enough money to feed their families. Cooking oils are up 26.5%. Electricity is up 8.2%. Oranges are up 9.4%. Cooking appliances are up 9.4%. Meat is up 11.7%. Bakery products are up 5.7%.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7064549" data-originallang="en">Only 16.3% of Canadians share a positive outlook on future finances six months from now. The statistics do not lie, and despite what the government says in the House, Canadians are not stupid.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7064550" data-originallang="en">The <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> tried to defend this today, saying that he thinks the Conservatives believe that the government is doing too much. That is just not the case. The government is doing the wrong things. It is not doing the right things. It is making its decisions based on ideology and vote-grabbing, as we saw with the recent Liberal-NDP coalition.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7064551" data-originallang="en">The government tried to say it was providing day care, when this exact system has been absolutely trouble-fraught in Quebec. I have had many people tell me that it does not address the needs of single people, seniors and those who have already had their children go through the system. Canadians are not stupid.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7064552" data-originallang="en">The government will try to blame the pandemic on supply chains, when it sent our own PPE across the ocean. It will try to blame it, and we will hear it in the response, on Ukraine, when the government has done nothing but support undemocratic regimes and dictators around the world. It could have done so much more in an effort to prevent all of this. Canadians are not stupid.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7064553" data-originallang="en">In fact, we hear arrogance every day from the government and we hear ignorance every day from the government. The government is entirely out of touch. It is all that we hear in the House. Despite what it says, Canadians are not stupid.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7064554" data-originallang="en">Now, we have an NDP-Liberal coalition. In HUMA last week, they could not tell me how much a dental program would cost. They could not tell me how much a pharmacare program would cost. They could not tell me what the housing initiatives would cost. We can do nothing but prepare for that in the budget tomorrow. Canadians will see nothing but spending, which achieves so little to help them with their cost of living.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7064555" data-originallang="en">Let us hear what the response is. Regardless of what it is, Canadians are not stupid.</p>
