<p data-HoCid="7346029" data-originallang="fr">Madam Chair, like Mr. Champoux, I am sorry that this meeting, which was so important to the Jewish and francophone communities, was sabotaged by the Conservatives. I don't understand at all why they did it. There is no logic to it, it makes no sense at all. I have a lot of questions that I couldn't ask, because the Conservatives completely sabotaged the meeting.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7346030" data-originallang="en">It's quite striking to me, Madam Chair, that at a time when anti-Semitism is growing, and this was a crucial hearing to get answers as to why this contract was accorded, the Conservatives sabotaged the hearing, shut it down, basically filibustered it out. So I, for one—and I know other members had many questions that they were hoping to ask—can't ask those questions. Now we have to convene at taxpayers' expense another meeting with the ministerial officials so we can actually get the answers that we couldn't get today because of the Conservatives sabotaging it. It's also disrespect—</p>
