<p data-HoCid="8382299" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8382300" data-originallang="en">I want to preface my comments today with a very important note for any survivors of sexual assault in Canada who may be watching this, or for those who may be interested in topics related to the RCMP and the participation or acknowledgement of sexual assault across Canada, particularly of indigenous women. This is a content warning for much of my discussion here. I want to be very clear about that and support women and gender-diverse folks who are survivors of this. I will be prefacing my further questions in relation to sexual assault within the RCMP, and by the RCMP, with these comments.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8382301" data-originallang="en">I want to acknowledge, as well, that there is an immense history in Canada that pertains to the RCMP's involvement and direct participation in the project of colonizing North America.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8382302" data-originallang="en">I was privy to the Pope coming to Canada to apologize for the church's role in the horrific residential school system. My family received a note from then Prime Minister Stephen Harper for the horrendous treatment of children and an apology from the Government of Canada to survivors, including my grandmother.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8382303" data-originallang="en">One of the worst things Canada has ever done and a sin we have to acknowledge continuously—because it hasn't changed—is this system and how it continues to affect indigenous people today. The fact that the British Isles could send so many to Canada to attack so many other, innocent people.... There was the attack and humiliation of men—my ancestors—when the North-West Mounted Police was created. The toppling of the Red River Métis settlement and the destruction of Batoche were core mandates of the North-West Mounted Police. This is the founding mandate of the RCMP today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8382304" data-originallang="en">This founding mandate was carried on continuously. Institutions like the church and the government continued to take children. After our men were beaten and wounded, the children were attacked. Finally, they took women, the life-givers and water-bearers of our nation. Today the RCMP is still conducting...participating in violence against women.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8382305" data-originallang="en">Mr. Larkin, you speak about respect for indigenous people. It's continuously in the news, though. You don't have to look that far. RCMP are continuously engaged in this violence.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8382306" data-originallang="en">I'm going to quote from the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Inquiry's final report, which was blunt in its assessment. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8382307" data-originallang="en">It said:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8382308" data-originallang="en"> The RCMP have not proven to Canada that they are capable of holding themselves to account. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8382309" data-originallang="en">This is a policy failure of a government that is not interested in holding those who perpetrate violence accountable. The RCMP, by indigenous persons' own claims, can't hold themselves accountable. Who are we to turn to when we pick up the phone and realize the very same perpetrators of sexual violence are the RCMP? You can imagine my tremendous frustration with this. If it was your family—your mother, grandmother or daughter—imagine the pain. Imagine it for a moment, Mr. Larkin. Imagine the pain of an auntie having to succumb to this kind of violence. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8382310" data-originallang="en">As someone who hasn't particularly been involved in this work, I can't speak about this extreme violence. However, I know my colleague <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Leah Gazan, the member of Parliament for Winnipeg Centre</a>, has done a tremendous job attempting to hold Canada accountable for the crisis that is murdered and missing indigenous women and girls. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8382311" data-originallang="en">She spoke to me of a case stemming from Manitoba. You may be familiar with it. It was in relation to RCMP Constable Kevin Theriault.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8382312" data-originallang="en">CBC said:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8382313" data-originallang="en"> [He] took an intoxicated Aboriginal woman he had arrested out of a cell and drove her to his northern Manitoba home to “pursue a personal relationship,” according to RCMP adjudication documents obtained by CBC News. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8382314" data-originallang="en"> Fellow officers teased and goaded him by text message to see “how far he would go,” and another constable observed flirting between Theriault and the woman, saying he “jokingly made a comment about having a threesome” with her. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8382315" data-originallang="en"> The senior officer in the detachment first said “it wasn't right” for Theriault to take the woman out of custody but finally said: “You arrested her, you can do whatever the f--k you want to do.” </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8382316" data-originallang="en"> This isn't just today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8382317" data-originallang="en">Maria Campbell was a remarkable Métis person and a survivor of the violence she had to witness during the clearing of the plains, which the RCMP participated in. She recounted a story in her book, <em>Halfbreed</em>, of being raped by an RCMP member at the age of 14. He dragged her into a bedroom of her own home. One of the RCMP members had come to hassle the family about alleged poaching.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8382318" data-originallang="en"> The RCMP's sexual abuse of indigenous women and girls is an open secret that is well known by indigenous communities. This is a tremendous pain in our country today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8382319" data-originallang="en">The Auditor General's report suggests, but I would say it needs to go much further.... It needs to recount, Madam Auditor General, the true history of the project that is the RCMP's core mandate. It must go beyond training. It must focus on accountability. It must focus on individuals being held to true account. Supervisors and commissioners cannot continue to be complacent in this violence.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8382320" data-originallang="en">Just recently, three days ago, there was the case of an RCMP officer being charged with child sexual exploitation in St. Paul, Alberta. When is this going to end?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8382321" data-originallang="en"> When will the RCMP take seriously its history, account for that history and be accountable for the many lives it's affected and continues to affect today? </p>
