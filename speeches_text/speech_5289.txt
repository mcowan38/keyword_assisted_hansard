<p data-HoCid="8661029" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge Iris Weinstein Haggai, whose parents, Judi Weinstein and Gadi Haggai, were taken hostage and murdered by Hamas following the October 7 terrorist attack in Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8661030" data-originallang="en"> Iris's mother, Judi, grew up in Toronto before moving to Israel in the 1970s, where she raised their family in the Nir Oz kibbutz. Judi was a daughter, mother and grandmother who loved her community. She taught children and wrote poetry.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8661031" data-originallang="en"> Judi was a Canadian, and her life exemplified Canadian values. For over a year, Iris has fought for justice for her mother and for the rights of families of the victims to see their loved ones returned home. I applaud her courage and call on the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="MÃ©lanie Joly">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> to do everything in her power to secure the repatriation of Canadians who were victims of the October 7 terrorist attacks.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8661032" data-originallang="en"> When I met with Iris, she asked that everyone remember and say her mother's name. I hope all members and, indeed, all Canadians will remember this name: Judi Weinstein. We must bring her and all the hostages home now.</p>
