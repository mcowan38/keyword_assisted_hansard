<p data-HoCid="8019163" data-originallang="en">I look forward to—given that we are so keen, all of us, to make sure that we don't do things and shouldn't do things to incite hatred or racism—that, as we ensure we work hard to make sure that our colleagues call out when they are associating with anti-Semites, Islamophobes and neo-Nazis, we take it upon ourselves to make sure that our colleagues are doing that, we take it upon ourselves to apologize when we try to implement government policies like a ban on the niqab and we apologize for voting against motions that condemn Islamophobia. It think it's really important that we hold ourselves to these very important standards and that we are consistent in that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8019164" data-originallang="en">I am grateful that all of us in this room have decided that we take it upon ourselves to condemn anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, because that's the right thing to do. We have all rightly condemned the work of Mr. Marouf, or I think we have, anyway— </p>
