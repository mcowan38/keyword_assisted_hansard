<p data-HoCid="7002224" data-originallang="en"> Thank you. It's an honour and a pleasure to be testifying before the committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002225" data-originallang="en">I'd like to share with you some of my thoughts from the United Nations Human Rights Council, where I'm speaking to you from in Geneva. The 2022 session has just opened.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002226" data-originallang="en">Sadly, with the founding resolution of the council, 60/251, which was adopted in 2006 when the council was created as a body to form the Human Rights Commission, although members were supposed to be those upholding the highest standards, we see the very opposite. We see that dictatorships are increasing in their audacity in human rights abuses and in their audacity to join the Human Rights Council. The current membership of the council is the worst that it's ever been, as 68.1% of the council fail to meet minimal democracy standards.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002227" data-originallang="en">I'd like to put a spotlight on some of those countries that are abusing their positions at the UN.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002228" data-originallang="en">We have China as a member of the council, which has herded one million Muslims into camps.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002229" data-originallang="en"> We have Cuba as a member of the council. It has been a communist tyranny now for more than six decades and has been committing widespread human rights abuses in the past year, arresting hundreds of democratic peaceful protesters, putting them in prison and now on trial.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002230" data-originallang="en">We have Eritrea as a member of the Human Rights Council, which has a system of slave labour.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002231" data-originallang="en">We have Libya as a member of the Human Rights Council, which tortures African migrants and puts them up for sale in slave markets.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002232" data-originallang="en">We have Mauritania as a member of the Human Rights Council, which is considered by The Guardian and CNN as the last bastion of slavery in the world.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002233" data-originallang="en">We have Pakistan as a member of the Human Rights Council, which systematically persecutes minorities, religious minorities in particular, and hosts terrorist groups.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002234" data-originallang="en">We have Russia, of course. It's already been addressed, but there are terrible atrocities taking place now in its invasion and assault on Ukraine. Let's not forget at home that Russia is a country that poisons dissidents, people like Vladimir Kara-Murza and Alexei Navalny.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002235" data-originallang="en">We have Somalia as a member of the Human Rights Council, which has one of the worst situations of female genital mutilation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002236" data-originallang="en">As a member of the Human Rights Council, we have Venezuela, where five million have fled due to oppression and the collapse of the state due to failed policies.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002237" data-originallang="en">We have other countries sitting on human rights bodies, such as Iran. In a few weeks, it will join the UN Commission on the Status of Women. It's a country that systematically subjugates women.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002238" data-originallang="en">I'd like to put a brief spotlight on some situations that are of particular note by looking at political prisoners. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7002239" data-originallang="en">I'd like to put a spotlight on Felix Maradiaga, who is an opposition leader. He was recently convicted, on Wednesday, along with six other Nicaraguan political and business leaders, including three would-be presidential candidates. They were convicted of conspiring to damage the country's sovereignty, effectively a charge akin to treason. They'll be sentenced soon. They're among a group of almost 50 political student, peasant and business leaders, journalists, and human rights activists who were detained by Mr. Ortega's security forces last summer. He quashed potential opposition in preparation for the November election, which he won easily by detaining seven of his would-be candidates. I think we need to put a greater spotlight, certainly in Canada, on the case of people like Felix Maradiaga, and I hope that happens.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002240" data-originallang="en">Moving over to Africa, we have Zimbabwe. I'd like to put a focus on one particular human rights defender, Hopewell Chin'ono, an award-winning journalist and filmmaker, who won CNN's African journalist of the year. In 2020, he published an exposé, alleging corruption in the administration of President Mnangagwa. His reporting forced the government to fire the health minister, but it also resulted in his arrest on baseless charges. He's been arrested for the third time in six months, in January 2021, on charges of “communicating falsehoods”, which aim to silence him.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002241" data-originallang="en">In Cuba, as I mentioned, we have systematic oppression. I'd like to put a focus on Hamlet Lavastida, a Cuban visual artist, political activist, who is the founder of Cuba's most prominent artist-led campaign group, the San Isidro movement. He was imprisoned on June 26, 2021, arrested for ideas that he shared with members of the artist activist group to stamp Cuban currency with subversive anti-communist symbols. He spent three months incarcerated at Villa Marista, the high-security prison that is famous for holding political prisoners. He was released in September, but only on the condition that he would go into forced exile.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002242" data-originallang="en"> Finally, for political prisoners I would like to put a spotlight on Nahid Taghavi, a German-Iranian woman who was arrested and sentenced to prison in August. She was charged with participating in illegal propaganda activities against the regime. She is 66 years old. She was given a prison sentence of 10 years and eight months. She was arrested at her Tehran apartment in October 2020 and has been held at Tehran's Evin prison. She's known as a advocate for human rights in Iran, and in particular for women's rights and freedom of expression. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7002243" data-originallang="en">As I mentioned, all of these countries hold positions of power at the UN. Iran is joining the women's right commission. Cuba is on the Human Rights Council. Nicaragua sits on the committee and overseas human rights NGOs.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002244" data-originallang="en">I will just conclude with mentioning that I disagree with Amnesty International completely in their comments about the situation in Israel. I've spent a lot of time there and there are problems there, but to accuse it of apartheid as they have is absurd. Israel has full equality for Arabs who can vote and are elected, and it has an Arab party in the government. As the French President Macron recently said, this accusation is absurd on its face.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002223" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
