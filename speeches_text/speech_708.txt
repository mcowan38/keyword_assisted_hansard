<p data-HoCid="6503529" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, as a first step, I think the government needs to get its act together on this. The <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>'s hand-picked ambassador to the United Nations is saying that what is going on with the Uighurs fits the definition of “genocide” and the hon. chair of the finance committee has indicated concerns about our relationship with China. However, the Prime Minister says “genocide” is a loaded term. It is a loaded term for good reason.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6503530" data-originallang="en">It is really time for the Prime Minister to stand up. What we need to do is work to create an international coalition of like-minded countries. They should come together and come up with a strategy to deal with genocide, not unlike what happened during the Holocaust. Magnitsky sanctions could be a very effective tool, and the Olympics, of course.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6503531" data-originallang="en">On social justice issues around indigenous Canadians, I am very sympathetic to arguments on that. I did not come prepared to debate that issue today, but I am certainly open-minded and would love to have a debate about it and hear arguments around those issues—</p>
