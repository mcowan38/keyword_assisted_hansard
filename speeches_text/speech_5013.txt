<p data-HoCid="8583939" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, it has been months since the UN Secretary-General first referred to Gaza as a “graveyard for children”. Civilians continue to face indiscriminate bombing and starvation. Now the people of Lebanon face unimaginable danger in the deadliest escalation of violence between Israel and Hezbollah since 2006.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8583940" data-originallang="en">The threat of war between Israel and Iran looms over all in the region. The starvation and perpetual bombing of the displaced population in Gaza, which includes one million children, are intolerable. Attacks on civilians in Palestine, Lebanon and Israel must stop. Nobody in the region is safer today than they were 12 months ago. There can be no military solution to their suffering.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8583941" data-originallang="en">There should be no support from Canada for warmongers anywhere. The NDP is renewing our call for a full two-way arms embargo, recognition of the state of Palestine, sanctions on extremist Israeli leaders, a permanent ceasefire and the release of all hostages.</p>
