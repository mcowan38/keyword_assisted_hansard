<p data-HoCid="8108483" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, today, we remember the real reason for the season.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8108484" data-originallang="en">C is for the Christ child who was born in Bethlehem that first Christmas night.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8108485" data-originallang="en">H is for the hope for all humanity that came down to us.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8108486" data-originallang="en">R is for the fact that there was no room in the inn for Him. The question remains: Is there room for Him in our world and hearts today?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8108487" data-originallang="en">I is for Immanuel, which means “God is with us”, and He is indeed with us through whatever we are going through and will be with us until the end.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8108488" data-originallang="en">S is for the shepherds, commoners, farmers and keepers of the flock, who were the first to be entrusted with the great news of His birth.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8108489" data-originallang="en">T is for the three wise men, who came searching for the newborn king of Israel. The wise still seek Him today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8108490" data-originallang="en">M is for the fact that He makes all things new again.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8108491" data-originallang="en">A is for all, because the promise of Christmas is for all people everywhere.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8108492" data-originallang="en">S is for the Saviour, who frees the whole world and every individual from fear, sin, shame and sadness, and as a result, a weary world rejoices.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8108493" data-originallang="en">From my family to others and to all Canadians, merry Christmas and happy new year.</p>
