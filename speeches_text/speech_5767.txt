<p data-HoCid="8756247" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I am going to have to listen to that again. It did not seem to me like an answer to the question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8756248" data-originallang="fr">Hate speech is supposed to be a crime, period. Either we believe that or not. Quebec is asking that the religious exception protecting hate speech in section 319 of the Criminal Code be repealed. The timing is good, because the Bloc Québécois's Bill <a data-HoCid="12830843" href="/bills/44-1/C-373/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (promotion of hatred or antisemitism)">C‑373</a> does exactly that. It is the only bill to do so. It conveys a clear principle that deserves clear support.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8756249" data-originallang="fr">Will the government finally get behind the Bloc Québécois to amend section 319 of the Criminal Code and abolish the religious exemption?</p>
