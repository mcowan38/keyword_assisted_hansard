<p data-HoCid="8576695" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, at least 1,000 Lebanese people have been killed by Israeli bombs in the last few days. One million people have fled their homes. Almost 45,000 Lebanese Canadians currently live in Lebanon. They are worried and terrified. They want Canada to stand up and protect them, but where is Canada? It used to be a champion of peace and justice, including in the Middle East. Instead of that, it has been part of the problem, failing to stand up to Netanyahu's far-right, genocidal government. The Liberals have been speaking from both sides, playing politics with communities and people's lives.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576696" data-originallang="en">Why has Canada failed to call for a permanent ceasefire now and to bring in a full, two-way arms embargo that does not include loopholes? Why has it failed to apply sanctions on Israel to the fullest extent and refused to recognize a Palestinian state? Why is it dithering while Lebanon is invaded and bombed? </p>
<p data-HoCid="8576697" data-originallang="en">The Lebanese people, Palestinians and Israelis deserve to live in peace. When will the Liberals take a stand for the peace and justice the world desperately needs? </p>
