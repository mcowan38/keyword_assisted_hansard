<p data-HoCid="8212192" data-originallang="en">I'm going to ask you three questions, Minister, and then I'll have you respond to them at the end and give you some time for that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8212193" data-originallang="en">I am going to ask some questions about the Middle East, and I'm going to start with our arms sales to Israel. I've asked Order Paper questions and have been given very substandard responses. I know the media are very frustrated. They're getting different answers at different times.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8212194" data-originallang="en">This is the first question. To be clear, has Canada been sending arms, and is Canada sending arms—whether they are military or non-military, whether it is technology, whether it's lethal or non-lethal or dual-use—to Israel?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8212195" data-originallang="en">The reason I'm asking that question is that with the ICJ investigation that says there is a plausible case of genocide happening, Canada could be complicit. I'm concerned that Canada could be complicit in a genocide if we are continuing to sell arms.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8212196" data-originallang="en">The second thing that I wanted to ask you about is this. I think I've been very clear that I was horrified by your government's decision to defund UNRWA—absolutely horrified. We know it is the only organization that can get life-saving support to innocent children in Gaza. That's very clear.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8212197" data-originallang="en">Your decision was made. It's now being reported by the CBC that Canadian officials had no information when they made that decision, and it was simply on the basis of information you received from Israel. I have deep concerns about that. Could you talk a little bit about how you justify that, and when we can expect that pause to be lifted so that the innocent children in Gaza aren't the ones who are suffering from the terrorist actions of Hamas? </p>
<p data-HoCid="8212198" data-originallang="en">That does bring me to Hamas. I have to say—</p>
