<p data-HoCid="7265184" data-originallang="en">My final thoughts are that I would urge the committee to act expeditiously. The technology's developing every year, and as things stand it's a too-far unregulated field that is inflicting harm every day. There are very concrete, specific laws that can be enacted. There is regulation that can be effective, regardless of what has happened before, so I hope that the committee will keep in mind the very specific recommendations that Mr. Israel provided and others. It's not too late to act.</p>
