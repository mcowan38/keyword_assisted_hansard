<p data-HoCid="7957591" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, I welcome the member to the House.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957592" data-originallang="en">There is no doubt that Hamas is the enemy of the Israeli people and the Palestinian people. The human rights violations have been widespread. The killing of 1,400 innocent people attests to that. They are brothers, sisters, parents and children who died. I know if any member in this House could have done anything to stop the deaths of 1,400 people, they would have stepped forward.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957593" data-originallang="en">That is the point the member for <a data-HoCid="278368" href="/politicians/heather-mcpherson/" title="Heather McPherson">Edmonton Strathcona</a> and the <a data-HoCid="278714" href="/politicians/jagmeet-singh/" title="Jagmeet Singh">leader of the NDP</a> made. At this sombre occasion, there is the collective punishment that is taking place and the bombing in Gaza right now. The death toll is rising to 3,000 people. There are 1,000 children dead so far and 10,000 wounded.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957594" data-originallang="en">The question is if we could stop the killing of those innocent lives, those brothers, sisters, parents and children, through this bombing, would we not step up to do that? Is that not what is behind the important call for a ceasefire, to have that humanitarian corridor so that food and water can get to the people who have no food, no medicine and no water? Ensuring that the hostages are released is absolutely fundamental as well. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7957595" data-originallang="en">Is that not our role? Should it be Canada's role to ensure there is no further loss of life?</p>
