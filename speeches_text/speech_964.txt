<p data-HoCid="6672321" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, last week at committee the <a data-HoCid="253393" href="/politicians/karina-gould/" title="Karina Gould">Minister of International Development</a> claimed that hateful content in UNRWA-produced materials was not produced by UNRWA and was removed last year, but a February impact report demonstrates the continuing presence of hateful content in UNRWA-produced study materials, which denounce Arab states over the Abraham Accords and call for the banishment of Jews from Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6672322" data-originallang="en">Could the <a data-HoCid="253393" href="/politicians/karina-gould/" title="Karina Gould">minister</a> confirm that she is now aware that hateful content persists in UNRWA-produced materials and tell the House what she intends to do about it?</p>
