<p data-HoCid="8714831" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, for welcoming me back.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714832" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Chair and honourable members of the committee, I want to thank you for this opportunity to discuss Canada's advancement of a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I will use it to briefly describe Canada's long-standing position in support of a two-state solution and how we have responded to developments on the ground in this regard. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8714833" data-originallang="en">However, I will flag from the outset—much like my colleague did in the previous session—that this issue is evolving rapidly and is under active consideration at this very moment. Consequently, I hope the committee will appreciate that while I will do my best to provide analysis and offer views on the various considerations, I am not in a position to comment on any advice the department may be providing to the government. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8714834" data-originallang="en">Canada's position on questions relating to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains guided by a historic commitment to a two-state solution, as it has always been. Support for the creation of a sovereign, independent, viable, democratic and territorially contiguous Palestinian state, one living side by side with Israel in peace and security, has been the standing position of consecutive Canadian governments over the decades.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714835" data-originallang="fr">In 1947, Canada played a key role as a member of the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine, or UNSCOP. It was one of seven members of the committee to approve the partition plan for Palestine.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714836" data-originallang="fr">On November 29, 1947, Canada was one of 33 UN member states to vote in favour of Resolution 181, which recommended the creation of independent Jewish and Arab states and a <em>corpus separatum</em> for Jerusalem.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714837" data-originallang="fr">Twenty years later, in the aftermath of the 1967 Six-Day War, Canada also voted in favour of UN Security Council Resolution 242, which called for a comprehensive, just and lasting peace within the framework of a negotiated peace agreement and full diplomatic recognition between the parties.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714838" data-originallang="fr">In 1993, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, or PLO, signed the Declaration of Principles, also known as the Oslo Accords, which included the creation of an interim governmental entity in the West Bank and Gaza, the Palestinian Authority, as well as mutual recognition of Israel and the PLO. Canada has fully supported the peace process defined by the Oslo Accords, and has always maintained that a negotiated two-state solution is the only way to achieve the goal of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714839" data-originallang="en"> In recent years, prospects for a negotiated two-state solution have diminished. They deteriorated significantly following Hamas's brutal terrorist attack against Israel of October 7, 2023, in light of the human toll of the Israeli military offensive in the Gaza Strip, and the broader escalation in the region. This grim context has reignited discussions around the world on the prospects for a two-state solution and the path to peace.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714840" data-originallang="fr"> It is clear that we urgently need to build a credible path to a two-state solution whose process cannot indefinitely delay the creation of a Palestinian state.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714841" data-originallang="fr">In response to developments on the ground, Canada's Permanent Representative to the United Nations indicated to the UN General Assembly in May of this year that the Government of Canada was prepared to recognize the State of Palestine at the time most conducive to a lasting peace, and not necessarily as the final step in the process.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714842" data-originallang="en">State recognition does not negate the critical need for direct bilateral negotiations between the parties. The Government of Canada considers that key final status issues, such as the status of Jerusalem, can only be resolved through negotiations among the parties concerned in the context of a final status peace agreement. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8714843" data-originallang="en">Canada has historically played a role in the search for a viable and comprehensive solution on those issues and stands ready to support new negotiations in the future.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714844" data-originallang="en">The government also believes that durable peace needs to be regional and include the full integration of Israel in the Middle East. The government has welcomed the 2020 Abraham Accords as a positive step towards Israel's integration into the region. Global Affairs Canada will continue to work with the international community to advance these efforts, keeping in mind the need for long-term security guarantees for Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714845" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, the issue that you are studying today is one that merits thoughtful consideration and an understanding of the various implications. I hope our testimony today will contribute to this endeavour.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714846" data-originallang="fr">Thank you.</p>
