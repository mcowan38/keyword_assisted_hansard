<p data-HoCid="8703073" data-originallang="en">I want to follow up, because I'm still curious about your opinion. I mean, we can argue about what the UN says about entitlement to a Palestinian state or not, but I want to know your opinion, because in my opinion, the State of Palestine is not ours to give or take back. It's not ours to reward or hold back. The Palestinians are entitled to a Palestinian state. It doesn't prejudge the outcome of negotiations or borders or right of return, etc. </p>
