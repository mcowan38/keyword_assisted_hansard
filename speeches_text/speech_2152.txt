<p data-HoCid="7661134" data-originallang="en">I have a second question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7661135" data-originallang="en">In terms of quality of care in the for-profit sector, there are some that say the for-profits can offer high-quality care, unique services, specific art space and so on and so forth. I know that in my riding of York Centre the Jewish community has a wonderful not-for-profit day care that's actually inclusive of the entire community, regardless of religion or background. What would you say to that in terms of quality of care and for-profit versus non-profit?</p>
