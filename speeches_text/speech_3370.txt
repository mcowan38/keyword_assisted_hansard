<p data-HoCid="8172968" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much, Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8172969" data-originallang="en">I want to also personally thank MP Gazan for moving this amendment.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8172970" data-originallang="en">I introduced Bill <a data-HoCid="12260777" href="/bills/44-1/C-318/" title="An Act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and the Canada Labour Code (adoptive and intended parents)">C-318</a> to address the current discrimination that exists in our employment insurance program. I want it on the record that because this bill does not explicitly include claimants in a customary care arrangement, it was my expectation that they would have access to it, as is generally the case with the current parental benefits. I recognize that this amendment will ensure their inclusion, which I believe to be in the same spirit and intent as my private member's bill, so I will be supporting this amendment.</p>
