<p data-HoCid="8300302" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300303" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Minister, for being with us today. I'm sorry I couldn't be there in person and instead have to use Zoom, but this was my only option.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300304" data-originallang="fr">I want to talk about a very specific case that will perhaps give you an idea of why we are having trouble understanding your program, which you put in place around Christmas.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300305" data-originallang="fr">Nibal Lubbad, a Canadian doctor of Palestinian origin who lives in the Niagara region, contacted me about her family in Gaza. Both of her parents managed to get out of Gaza at the eleventh hour and ended up in Egypt. She contacted me because she wasn't getting any help from the Conservative MP who represents her riding. People referred her to me. I tried to contact people in your office to get her parents out of there, But I had one heck of a time, sadly. Her father's name is Khalil Lubbad, and her mother's name is Yosra Lubbad.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300306" data-originallang="fr">It was December 22 or 23, during the holidays. I'm always working, Minister, no matter what time or day it is. To this day, we still haven't received a response from the department. They even asked Mrs. Lubbad to send them some missing documents, which she had already sent. She sent them again and, since then, there has been no contact from your department about this program.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300307" data-originallang="fr">Can I have your assurance today that someone from your office will contact me after the session so that we can resolve the issue and bring these people here to Canada?</p>
