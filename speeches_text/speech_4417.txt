<p data-HoCid="8454078" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8454079" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Minister and officials, for being here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8454080" data-originallang="en">Minister, as you know, innocent lives are being lost in Gaza, Rafah and Sudan. Unfortunately, our Conservative colleagues are more concerned about Netanyahu's hypothetical arrest than calling for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and Rafah. Sadly, Conservatives are using this human tragedy for their political advantage, which is very painful. This meeting was dedicated to Gaza and Sudan, and they're coming with different questions and diverting. Conservatives have not once called for a ceasefire since this tragedy started, and this is the tragedy of the century. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8454081" data-originallang="en">I want to ask you what challenges you're facing in bringing people from Gaza or Sudan here under the measures you announced.</p>
