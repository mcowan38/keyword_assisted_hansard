<p data-HoCid="7961614" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, after eight years of the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, Canada has lost its reputation as a world leader in energy production. After we told Germany, Japan and France that there is no business case for LNG, Qatar is now the supplier of choice for our G7 allies.

<p data-HoCid="7961615" data-originallang="en">Will the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> admit that there is not only a business case for LNG but a moral one as well?</p>
