<p data-HoCid="8760047" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8760048" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Minister, for appearing before the committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8760049" data-originallang="en">Minister, I represent a large Lebanese community in my riding of Scarborough Centre that is very worried for the safety of their relatives back in Lebanon. I have one constituent who in days lost his brother and his wife and their three children in one Israeli bombing and his other younger brother and his wife in another bombing. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8760050" data-originallang="en">The community is beside themselves with anger and grief. They see the help we have given to people fleeing the war in Ukraine. They see the program to bring the extended families of Canadian citizens and permanent residents in Gaza to Canada for temporary safety. They have asked me to ask you, Minister, this: Will you commit to doing the same for the extended families of Lebanese Canadians who are losing members of their family daily?</p>
