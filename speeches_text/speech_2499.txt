<p data-HoCid="7927446" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness that I rise today to respond to the statement that you just made and to address what happened in the House on Friday.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7927447" data-originallang="en">Every day members of Parliament entrust the Speaker to guide this Parliament through challenging circumstances. You, Mr. Speaker, have done an admirable job doing just that through COVID-19, the occupation of downtown Ottawa last winter and the putting in place of a hybrid Parliament.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7927448" data-originallang="fr">As members know, <em>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</em> indicates that the Speaker's role is not just administrative and procedural, but also ceremonial and diplomatic. It states that the Speaker often acts as a representative of the House of Commons. Because of his ceremonial role and his role as a representative, he is the only one who has the privilege of recognizing the presence of guests and visitors in the gallery.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7927449" data-originallang="fr">It was this privileged role that led to the recognition on Friday of an individual who, as the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center pointed out, was a member of the Waffen-SS, a Nazi military branch that was responsible for the murder of Jews and that was declared a criminal organization during the Nuremberg trials. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7927450" data-originallang="en">It is shocking that this individual was a guest of the House and shocking that members of Parliament rose to give him an ovation. Members did so because we took the <a data-HoCid="279135" href="/politicians/anthony-rota/" title="Anthony Rota">Speaker</a>'s word that this individual should indeed be granted this honour in good faith.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7927451" data-originallang="en">We have members of Parliament who have dedicated significant parts of their lives to fighting racism, fascism and anti-Semitism. We have members of Parliament who lost family members to Naziism. Two members of my family, my uncle and my grandfather, whose names are commemorated on the cenotaph in New Westminster, B.C., are part of the scars of this history. These same members of Parliament feel betrayed right now, as do members of the Jewish community and other communities who were victims of the horrific violence of the Nazis. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7927452" data-originallang="fr">In many ways, the Speaker is the face of the House. Not only does he represent its members, but even more importantly, he represents our shared commitment to democratic principles and institutions. In upholding these democratic norms, the Speaker's actions must be above reproach.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7927453" data-originallang="fr">Although we appreciate the Speaker's apology yesterday and his remarks today, I very regretfully and sadly consider them insufficient.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7927454" data-originallang="en">Ultimately, this was an unforgivable error. It puts the entire House in disrepute. Unfortunately, a sacred trust has been broken. It is for that reason, for the good of the institution of the House of Commons, that I say sadly that I do not believe you, Mr. Speaker, can continue in this role. Regrettably, I must respectfully ask that you step aside.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7927455" data-originallang="fr">For the good of Parliament, I ask that you resign from your position as Speaker.</p>
