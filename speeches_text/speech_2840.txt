<p data-HoCid="7964050" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, right now, the alleviation of human suffering is our number one priority. We continue, and will continue, to push for all parties to respect humanitarian and international law. This means access for civilians. This means accountability for those who do not follow international law. This means that we are using every diplomatic channel that we have to alleviate the suffering, and ensure that aid gets to the Palestinian civilians and that international law is complied with.</p>
