<p data-HoCid="6660539" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I have a petition, e-petition 3031, that I would like to present.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6660540" data-originallang="en"> It is signed by almost 1,400 residents who note that Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory are unlawful under international law, that Israeli occupation authorities have issued a decision to forcibly evict hundreds of Palestinians from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood of East Jerusalem and that forces have demolished many Palestinian homes in occupied Jerusalem since the beginning of this year.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6660541" data-originallang="en">They call upon the Government of Canada to call on Israel to stop its eviction of the Palestinian families in Sheik Jarrah and its carrying out of the announced land settlement of title and registration policy in occupied East Jerusalem, which will result in the permanent appropriation of Palestinian land by the State of Israel.</p>
