<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I was pleased and relieved to hear the <a data-HoCid="278714" href="/politicians/jagmeet-singh/" title="Jagmeet Singh">leader of the NDP</a> say that he stands in solidarity with Ukraine.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">However, the NDP member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> described the Ukrainian government as “an anti-Semitic, neo-nazi &amp; fascist militia”. The NDP member for <a data-HoCid="278640" href="/politicians/niki-ashton/" title="Niki Ashton">Churchill—Keewatinook Aski</a> retweeted a suggestion that our <a data-HoCid="263835" href="/politicians/chrystia-freeland/" title="Chrystia Freeland">Deputy Prime Minister</a>'s “Nazi past” is the reason that Canada is supporting Ukrainian sovereignty.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Will the leader of the NDP denounce these inflammatory, offensive comments from his caucus members in the House, comments which I would say resemble, very eerily, Russian propaganda?</p>
