<p data-HoCid="8683673" data-originallang="en">In the 1970s, provisions were added to the Criminal Code that prohibited the promotion of genocide and the incitement of hatred towards identifiable groups. The Harper Conservatives worked hard to remove a number of these protections, but the Supreme Court has been clear that the promotion of hate propaganda doesn't contribute and, in fact, “distort[s] or limit[s] the robust and free exchange of ideas by its tendency to silence the voice of its target group.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8683674" data-originallang="en"> When the <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">Conservative leader</a> describes Israel's expanding its bombing campaign as a “gift” to the world, or when the Liberal <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> sends weapons that could be used for what the ICJ considers a plausible genocide, are these not escalations? Are these not acts of hate?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8683675" data-originallang="en"> If we're going to talk about the role of government vis-à-vis freedom of expression and the need to protect freedom of expression but take a clear stand against hate, can we not talk about this wilful incitement of hate by two of the most powerful political figures in Canada at this time?</p>
