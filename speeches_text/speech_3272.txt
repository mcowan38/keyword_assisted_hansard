<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, 130 first nations in Ontario alone are suing the government because the carbon tax is not working. The member can split the words as much as he wants to. At the end of the day, indigenous peoples in Canada are not doing as well because we know the carbon tax impacts them. We know that it impacts the cost of heating their homes, the production of food and getting the food to first nations, especially in remote and rural areas.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">For anyone to ever question my support for first nations is laughable. I will continue to work with the incredible member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> when it comes to missing and murdered indigenous women and girls. Please, let us not be so petty.</p>
