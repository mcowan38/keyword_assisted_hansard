<p data-HoCid="8667275" data-originallang="en"> Thank you. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8667276" data-originallang="en">You were just talking about Community Notes, so it seems timely to reference a few. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8667277" data-originallang="en">This one is from the <a data-HoCid="278714" href="/politicians/jagmeet-singh/" title="Jagmeet Singh">leader of the NDP, Jagmeet Singh</a>, dated October 13: “Last year, Cenovus raked in $37 billion in profits. And a whopping $64 billion in 2022.” There is a Community Note on that, with a link to Yahoo! Finance news.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8667278" data-originallang="en">This is from August 17: “<a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Justin Trudeau</a> told Canadians things would be better, instead, they've gotten worse. Families are losing their homes”, and it goes on. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8667279" data-originallang="en">The Community Note says, “Justin Trudeau is in government because of a confidence and supply agreement with <a data-HoCid="278714" href="/politicians/jagmeet-singh/" title="Jagmeet Singh">Jagmeet Singh</a>.” </p>
<p data-HoCid="8667280" data-originallang="en">The community note goes on. Again on August 17, <a data-HoCid="278714" href="/politicians/jagmeet-singh/" title="Jagmeet Singh">Jagmeet Singh</a> said, “<a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Justin Trudeau</a> built people's hopes up, only to let them down.” Then he goes on to talk about rent prices, and there's a Community Note on that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8667281" data-originallang="en"> On March 18, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8667282" data-originallang="en"> BREAKING </p>
<p data-HoCid="8667283" data-originallang="en"> The vote is in and we have forced the Liberals to: </p>
<p data-HoCid="8667284" data-originallang="en"> Stop selling arms to the Israeli govt, </p>
<p data-HoCid="8667285" data-originallang="en"> Support the ICC and ICJ, </p>
<p data-HoCid="8667286" data-originallang="en"> Place sanctions on extremist settlers, </p>
<p data-HoCid="8667287" data-originallang="en"> and much more </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8667288" data-originallang="en"> The Community Note says, “The motion in question does not 'force' the Liberals to do anything.” It goes on. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8667289" data-originallang="en">On March 7, there's another Community Note. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8667290" data-originallang="en">Then this is one from February 27. It's a very interesting one: “80% of the grocery market is controlled by 5 corporations...Sobeys, Metro—and you guessed it, Loblaws.” Then he goes on to say, “Both Liberal and Conservative Party campaigns receive donations from the three.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8667291" data-originallang="en"> It's very interesting that Metro is added there, given that his brother lobbies for them. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8667292" data-originallang="en">The Community Note says, “The claim in the post is false. Corporate donations to federal political parties have been forbidden by law in Canada for over 15 years.” It's similar to the Liberals saying, “assault-style weapons”, which have been illegal for 40 years, and they know it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8667293" data-originallang="en"> There's another one on conflicts of interest. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8667294" data-originallang="en">What do we have? We have eight Community Notes. Have you ever seen a political leader in Canada get this many Community Notes? </p>
