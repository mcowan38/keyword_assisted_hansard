<p data-HoCid="6121228" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking all the health care workers at the CHU Sainte-Justine, the Jewish General Hospital and St. Mary's Hospital in my riding. I thank them for their incredible work. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6121229" data-originallang="fr">I also want to thank all my constituents. There are many people back home who are volunteering for charities. Two in particular come to mind, Astrid Arumae and Vanessa Reid in Outremont and Mile-End, who are organizing teams of volunteers on the ground.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6121230" data-originallang="fr">I would also like to thank my colleague from Beloeil—Chambly and all my Bloc Québécois colleagues for their work and their very constructive suggestions these past few weeks. I have a very simple question for my colleague from Beloeil—Chambly.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6121231" data-originallang="fr">Do you think the billions of dollars we are investing to support Canadians and Quebeckers through the Canada emergency response benefit and the wage subsidy is a good investment?</p>
