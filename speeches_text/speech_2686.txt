Yes, I would say that part of the reason the bonds of friendship and the amity exist between our country and the state of Israel is that we are democracies. Democracies are constantly aware of the fact that their actions and everything their governments undertake are underpinned by the values that inform their constitutions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957885" data-originallang="en">Yes, even at a time of war, I think it is incumbent upon all countries to make sure that they are adhering to the principles of humanitarian law. I know full well that our country does. We have numerous experts who are engaged in this process. It would do everyone well if they strictly adhered to the principles of humanitarian law.</p>
