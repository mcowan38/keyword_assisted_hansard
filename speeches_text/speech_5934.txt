<p data-HoCid="8826751" data-originallang="en"> Indeed, Chair, your role as chair is primary to that respect occurring. I would appreciate all colleagues here, when you ask for decorum, respecting that decorum, because, again, it's not about you personally, but the role you occupy. I will park those comments there.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8826752" data-originallang="en">Moving to the motion at hand, there appears to be a question here of ordering PavCo, which I believe is a ticket distribution company of some sort—I don't know, since it's been a while since I bought concert tickets—“to provide to the clerk of the committee, within two weeks, all records” and “providing of tickets for any of the Taylor Swift concerts at BC Place”, etc. Members have the motion before them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8826753" data-originallang="en">As I said in my discussion regarding the amendment, I have questions about why.... if we're concerned about—I guess this is what we're concerned about—undue influence being wielded by the offering of Taylor Swift tickets, I guess times have changed, but maybe not so much, because we heard how it was a question in earlier Parliaments of Justin Bieber tickets and a question of hockey game playoff tickets and whatnot for members, and not because members were themselves special people but because the role they occupied would have been accorded some kind of special favour or privilege.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8826754" data-originallang="en">When we hear that any member of Parliament or any senator is potentially in that role, it might be worth exploring the records of each and every parliamentarian, whether it be around a specific event or enlarged and spread out.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8826755" data-originallang="en">I want to think about that a little more, because it's not really my cup of tea to do that kind of thing. In fact, it is the role of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner to investigate if and when there is a complaint, either by a member of this Parliament or by a member of the public vis-à-vis the conduct of a member here. This is why we are advised—and we heard it from the commissioner himself on several occasions when colleagues were going down another rabbit hole—to consult with the Ethics Commissioner as often as we feel the need to when we are faced with a certain situation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8826756" data-originallang="en"> This is because any member at any time can be offered something that may be questionable during the course of their duties. It may be okay or it may not be okay, and it's not every member. What you think would be an open-and-shut case or a black and white situation is not always so. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8826757" data-originallang="en">We are very fortunate that we have the Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner to consult. Apparently, that was the case for <a data-HoCid="300020" href="/politicians/harjit-s-sajjan/" title="Harjit S. Sajjan">Minister Sajjan</a> when he attended, I believe, some kind of fundraiser in support of a food bank. He made a donation, the tickets were offered and he consulted the Ethics Commissioner, who said there was no problem with that and he could go ahead, but other people had plenty of problems with it, and Minister Sajjan declined the tickets in question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8826758" data-originallang="en"> Again, it's something that.... I look to a colleague like Mr. Villemure.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8826759" data-originallang="fr"> There are principles and regulations. Often, however, regulations don't fully reflect the principles. I agree that in some cases it's better to act beyond reproach. That was the minister's decision in this situation, but it took away the opportunity for some of our colleagues to question him and to take advantage outright of a very high-profile situation, since these were tickets to a Taylor Swift concert.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8826760" data-originallang="en">If it were a question of receiving a set of coffee cups or something, I don't think that would have received the same attention. They could have been very nice coffee cups. They could have been Tim Hortons coffee cups, which can go for a pretty penny sometimes, but no, that would not be of interest to colleagues who were seeking to take advantage of a grey zone situation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8826761" data-originallang="en">I have to say that I am really of two minds about whether this is something that is useful for this committee to look at. Is there sufficient concern or risk to our institution? That's really what we're talking about when we talk about issues of conflict of interest and ethics on the Hill in both our Houses, although here, of course, we just deal with the House of Commons. The question is, are we looking at a situation that could cast any doubt or bring a shadow over the institution in question? That is what really needs to be addressed, over and above any particular details of whatever that situation may be.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8826762" data-originallang="en"> As I said before, clearly, if I had been offered Taylor Swift tickets, I would not have taken them. Maybe I could have sold them on eBay; I don't know. Maybe I would have had some takers here, even in this room. That was not a situation that I was faced with, but it can be imagined that parliamentarians would be faced with a number of situations that, again, are in that zone. They're not out-and-out brown paper bags filled with cash. It's not that. It looks different, and there can be some question as to whether it is something that could cast a shadow over our institutions. That's where I am on paragraph (a).</p>
<p data-HoCid="8826763" data-originallang="en">On part (b), Chair, I always have a problem with “within one week”, “three days”, “48 hours”, etc., especially when we're heading into a period when we know that Parliament is closing down and there's a holiday period, or people are on vacation, and so on and so forth. To me, we have to give an opportunity to the people who do this work to do it properly.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8826764" data-originallang="en">As I say, I'm not really aware of what's involved. It's not like pulling up your own bank account and seeing what you pay for, although on that note, Chair, I wish people would pay more attention to that sort of thing, because they would then be more aware of their own financial situation. I'm alluding to something that happened to me earlier in the day, but that's neither here nor there.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8826765" data-originallang="en">Again, on the two minds, if we were to go down this road, what are we looking for? If we're going to look for it, we should look for it with a net wide enough to provide helpful information and result in something that can be used to better protect our institutions. If that's not the case—if, really and truly, the commissioner is sufficiently enabled to take the means necessary to protect the institution through his investigative powers—this is of no merit whatsoever and is not something I would support.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8826766" data-originallang="en">I'm going to leave it at that, Chair. However, can you put me back on the list? I want to come back with some of the other thoughts I've parked for the moment.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8826767" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
