<p data-HoCid="8256145" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8256146" data-originallang="en">I have two short points I want to make.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8256147" data-originallang="en">The first is that I've had a study on anti-Semitism on the table since December. I've politely waited to move it at committee until the steering committee has had the opportunity to consider it. My Conservative colleagues, who seem to want that, continue to put forward motions without going through the steering committee. I'm disappointed in that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8256148" data-originallang="en">The second point is that I think it is absolutely unfair to start making claims that any party at this table has ever voted for anything that would change the parole eligibility of the individual mentioned in the motion. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8256149" data-originallang="en">I agree with everything Mr. Maloney said. I don't think anybody here thinks anything other than this man should be imprisoned for the rest of his life. This gentleman was sentenced in 2007, and he has the same eligibility he had when he was sentenced in 2007. There have been no legislative changes since 2015 that anyone here has voted for that have extended his parole eligibility. There have been court judgments that struck down laws that were passed before 2015, but nobody here has been part of anything that has extended this gentleman's parole eligibility. It's important to say that. To start claiming that one party or another party has been responsible for traumatizing people is exceptionally offensive.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8256150" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair. I support the amendment.</p>
