<p data-HoCid="8703163" data-originallang="en">As basic conditions, I think we need to see a recognition of everyone's human rights and everyone's humanity in the region. I think Canada taking a position to recognize Palestinian self-determination and to recognize the Palestinian state so that there can be more genuine negotiations between those parties would go a long way, as would, of course, taking steps to pursue justice, including addressing the settlement issue and putting pressure on Israel, especially at this point, to stop its ongoing slaughter in Gaza and in the region. </p>
