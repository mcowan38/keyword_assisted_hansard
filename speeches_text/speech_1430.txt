<p data-HoCid="7033205" data-originallang="fr">Thank you for your question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7033206" data-originallang="fr">Forgive me, but I'm not able to give you details about every country, but my colleagues in charge of bilateral relations with those countries are probably better people to ask.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7033207" data-originallang="fr">I didn't know that Taiwan had asked Canada for doses. As far as I know, Taiwan was a model in its domestic pandemic response. It really set the standard for many countries in the world.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7033208" data-originallang="fr">As for Haiti, we talked a bit about the challenges that exist there. We strongly support the Haitian people, but the recent string of political crises has certainly complicated the reception of the many doses that Canada and other countries have supplied. We have much more work to do with our partners in Haiti. It is my hope that political and technical discussions will lead to better co‑operation, and make it easier to ship vaccine doses and administer them to the population.</p>
