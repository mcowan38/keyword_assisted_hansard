<p data-HoCid="6242315" data-originallang="en">Currently what the Chinese Communist Party is doing in East Turkestan in the 21st century is the same kind of genocide the fascist Germans did 70 years ago against the Jewish people. Also, in the 21st century, the main goal of this genocide by the Chinese Communist Party is to destroy ethnics, to destroy people. Now the people of East Turkestan have the same fate as the Jewish people had before. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6242316" data-originallang="en">I am asking the Canadian government to help the people of East Turkestan and to do everything possible to stop this crime.</p>
