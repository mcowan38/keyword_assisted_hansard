<p data-HoCid="7966933" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I just want to go back to when the member actually posed the question of the government. The <a data-HoCid="300017" href="/politicians/dominic-leblanc/" title="Dominic LeBlanc">Minister of Public Safety, Democratic Institutions and Intergovernmental Affairs</a> specifically addressed the member's question as follows: “As my colleague knows, decisions around listing terrorist entities are based on the advice of our security professionals.” I want to underline the words “security professionals.” The quote continues, “I have obviously asked them to update this advice for the government and we will take all necessary decisions as soon as it is appropriate.” I think it is fair to say that there are some exceptionally intelligent individuals out there to support Canadians through Parliament and provide sound advice to the minister and the minister is seeking to get that updated. The member knows that full well.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7966934" data-originallang="en">On the issue of what has been taking place, the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> said not that long ago, “Hamas is a terrorist organization that ... [slaughtered] and brutalized innocent people.” He went on to say, “Hamas continues to commit unspeakable ... [atrocities] and are trying to instigate further acts of violence against Jewish people....”</p>
<p data-HoCid="7966935" data-originallang="en">Let me be clear about Hamas. Its members “are not freedom fighters, they are not resistance fighters: they are terrorists.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="7966936" data-originallang="en">“Terrorism is always indefensible and nothing can justify Hamas' acts of terror and the killing, maiming, and abduction of...civilians.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="7966937" data-originallang="en">Let me also be extremely clear that, “Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people nor their legitimate aspirations. They do not speak for Muslim or Arab communities, and they do not represent the better futures that Palestinians and their children deserve. The only thing that they stand for is more suffering for Israeli and Palestinian civilians.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="7966938" data-originallang="en">With regard to condemning the Iranian regime and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, IRGC, I would like to emphasize that the Government of Canada uses various legal tools and has robust and far-reaching measures in place against Iran and the IRGC. These measures were undertaken in response to Iran's gross and systematic violations of human rights, ongoing support of terrorism and regional destabilization of security.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7966939" data-originallang="en">Our government has implemented the strongest sanctions in the world, which have made over 10,000 senior officials of the Iranian regime inadmissible to Canada. As an example, back in November 2022, Canada designated the Islamic Republic of Iran under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, or IRPA, for the regime's engagement in terrorism and continuous and gross human rights violations. As a result, tens of thousands of prominent Iranian government officials, including IRGC senior officials, are now permanently inadmissible to Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7966940" data-originallang="en">I am sure I will get an opportunity to add a few more comments in the follow-up question and answer.</p>
