<p data-HoCid="7524680" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, I was referring, in this case, to pension funds. I co-authored the op-ed with Phil Kretzmar of the Jewish community. The Jewish community understands genocide and it is very much behind trying to get our public pension funds and university funds out of investments in China. It's pension funds that I was referring to.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7524681" data-originallang="en">We will always trade with China. It needs our products and we need its products. Our trade, in fact, even during the horror crisis with the Michaels, was still going up, but in terms of our pension funds, I think we need to be cautious.</p>
