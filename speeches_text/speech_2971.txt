<p data-HoCid="8027950" data-originallang="en">Thank you for that. I certainly hope the member of the Conservative Party will apologize for what are appallingly irresponsible comments.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8027951" data-originallang="en">I want to come back to Ms. Lantsman's questions. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8027952" data-originallang="en">The Conservatives have been spreading disinformation. They've never apologized. They've never retracted it. They've never clarified their remarks. The attribution of the word “terrorist”, as you correctly pointed out, has been used consistently in CBC coverage. There is the appalling, horrible terrorist attack that killed over 1,400 Israelis. We're now seeing the horrible civilian casualties in Gaza. I have been watching CBC coverage, and the word “terrorist” has been used. It's always attributed, of course, but it's used consistently.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8027953" data-originallang="en">Can you, in a sense, refute Ms. Lantsman's contention that the word “terrorist” has not been used on the CBC network? When it has been used—and it has been used frequently—it has always been attributed.</p>
