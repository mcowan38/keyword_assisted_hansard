<p data-HoCid="6880079" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, five seconds is not enough. I will have to find another Yiddish proverb.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6880080" data-originallang="en">The member is correct. It was Bill <a data-HoCid="8117624" href="/bills/42-1/C-235/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (fetal alcohol disorder)">C-235</a>, proposed by Mr. Bagnell from the Yukon. He will forgive me for saying “from the Yukon”. I understand we are not supposed to say that, as it is the Yukon territory. It was an excellent piece of legislation because it carved out special treatment for offenders who have fetal alcohol syndrome. They should be treated differently in the judicial system.</p>
