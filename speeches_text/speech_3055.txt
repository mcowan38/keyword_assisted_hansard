<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8016511" data-originallang="fr"> O Allah, destroy the Zionist aggressors. O Allah, destroy the enemies of the people of Gaza. O Allah, count their number, slay them one by one and spare not one of them! </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8016512" data-originallang="fr">Does the Prime Minister think imam Charkaoui committed a Criminal Code offence when he uttered those comments in public?</p>
