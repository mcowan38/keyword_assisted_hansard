<p data-HoCid="8488146" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I am rising to speak to the question of privilege raised by the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> regarding the recent comments made by the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278683" href="/politicians/brad-redekopp/" title="Brad Redekopp">Saskatoon West</a>. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8488147" data-originallang="en">I understand you are currently considering this. I would like to urge you to give this question strong consideration. While the member for <a data-HoCid="278683" href="/politicians/brad-redekopp/" title="Brad Redekopp">Saskatoon West</a> has appropriately apologized for his original statement, I believe the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> has raised an important, unresolved issue with respect to how the record is modified in this place. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8488148" data-originallang="en">Specifically, when speaking of an indigenous person, the record was changed from “because of his racial background” to “regardless of his racial background.” This fundamentally alters the meaning of what was said. As the Speaker recently stated, “it is understood that the revisions should not alter the substance and the meaning of the members' statements in this House.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8488149" data-originallang="en">As the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> has noted already, from time to time members seek unanimous consent of the House to correct the record. This was not the case here. It would seem to me that this would be an appropriate option that would actually follow the practices of the House. For this reason, I hope you give this question of privilege appropriate consideration. </p>
