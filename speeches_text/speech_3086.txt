No one thinks it is acceptable, but it sure seems there is definitely an underground black market around sales of fish. Certainly there was also some media about a sturgeon that was caught and taken away in a vehicle. That was on Global News a few years ago. </p>

There has been lots of discussion, I heard, in the committee about some issues around crabbing, and the same for halibut. The reality is that it's happening and we are probably catching very few of the individuals involved. </p>
