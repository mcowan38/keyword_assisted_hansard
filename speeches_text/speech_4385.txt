<p data-HoCid="8455500" data-originallang="en"> Not only do I agree with that, but what I am seeing is an inconsistent application of the law right across the country. I'm seeing underutilization of various sections of the Criminal Code that do exist and that I have identified. I've also seen the absence of designated prosecutors to deal with these crimes so that you're actually having internal disagreement within Crown services about what is prosecutable and what is not. We need a national approach that understands anti-Semitism, understands the criminal law tools that are available to deal with it and applies across the country. </p>
