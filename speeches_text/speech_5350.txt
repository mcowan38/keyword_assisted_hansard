<p data-HoCid="8665261" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I would simply say that the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> has, today and on many occasions, made comments that are clearly unparliamentary in making accusations against members. Regardless of whether we couch them in whatever kind of framing around demographics, there are clear rules on parliamentary language, and this member from Winnipeg consistently uses unparliamentary language, as we have heard on multiple occasions today. She should be called to order by the Chair, consistent with how any other member would be treated, and she should be told she has to apologize.</p>
