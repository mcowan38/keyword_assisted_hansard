<p data-HoCid="6791845" data-originallang="en">Indeed, this is a significant concern for us and for all partners who do work in this area. The answer is that we put in place very significant controls on all of our projects that go into the region—particularly in Gaza but in West Bank as well. We apply what is called an “enhanced due diligence” system to our funding. That has a whole series of measures. There are anti-terrorism lists and based on our funding agreements, we use those lists. We work with our partners.</p>

<p data-HoCid="6791847" data-originallang="en">We supplement these lists and assessments with practical program implementation measures like screening, oversight, partners, site visits and verifications. We have teams in Ramallah that will go into Gaza and make sure the money goes to where it is needed. We also rely on trusted UN partners.</p>
