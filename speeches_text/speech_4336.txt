<p data-HoCid="8417523" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, this is something that I have been hearing a lot about, especially of late, in particular as it relates to some of the agendas, mostly political. With that, certain individuals seem to be fanning the flames of hate to further their own agendas.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8417524" data-originallang="en">Hate is on the rise in Canada. It is alarming and distressing to hear numerous accounts of hatred against people in our public forum, for example. This includes a rise in both anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. Hatred has no place in this country, in Canada. All people must feel safe to express themselves, whether it be online or off-line.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8417525" data-originallang="en">Can the <a data-HoCid="299996" href="/politicians/arif-virani/" title="Arif Virani">Minister of Justice</a> please discuss how the online harms act would help keep us safe from hatred?</p>
