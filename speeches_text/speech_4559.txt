<p data-HoCid="8534959" data-originallang="en">Just before this session, you were discussing Ukraine. There is no comparison in the interest of the international community between what's happening in Ukraine, a two-year-old war, and what's happening in Sudan and, similarly, Gaza. Sudan is literally buried under Gaza and Ukraine in the agendas of the international community. This needs to change quickly. Just last night, our vice-president of the Transitional Sovereign Council flew to Russia to make a deal to open our port to Russia, probably so they can have a military base there.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8534960" data-originallang="en">I think the neglect by the international community of what's happening in Sudan is, strategically and for global security, something the international community could pay a high price for. It's similar to the neglect of other situations in western Africa and other countries in Africa. The international community and the western world need to open their eyes very wide, because the war happening right now in Sudan is a proxy war. There's no doubt about that. Russia, the UAE and Iran are involved. This is not just a war of the Sudanese people. When we discuss it as a Sudanese people war, we are neglecting those factors, because without the weapons, money and resources provided to both fighting parties, this war would have never continued.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8534961" data-originallang="en"> I humbly ask you to take action to stop where this war is being funded from.</p>
