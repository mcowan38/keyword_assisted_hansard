<p data-HoCid="6017160" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, Canadians know we are a strong friend to Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6017161" data-originallang="en"> We maintain our opposition to the singling out of Israel, unfairly, at the United Nations, and have voted against the vast majority of the Israel-related votes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6017162" data-originallang="en">Canada is committed to the goal of comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East, including the creation of a Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6017163" data-originallang="en">In keeping with Canada's long-standing position, it is important at this time to restate our commitment to a two-state solution, and the equal rights and self-determination of peoples.</p>
