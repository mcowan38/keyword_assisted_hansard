<p data-HoCid="8643830" data-originallang="en"> Madam Speaker, I rise today to present a petition on behalf of concerned citizens across Canada, including hundreds of thousands who take the streets and those who are protesting on campuses regarding the ongoing Israeli crimes against humanity, collective punishment and forced starvation that constitute genocide in Gaza. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8643831" data-originallang="en">The petitioners draw attention to the severe loss of life, the catastrophic hunger and the widespread destruction affecting the people of Gaza, especially the children. They express grave concern over the reported obstruction of humanitarian aid and the resulting human suffering and starvation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8643832" data-originallang="en">The petitioners call on the Government of Canada to take immediate and decisive action by advocating for a permanent ceasefire, ensuring the safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid and supporting the critical work of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. They further urge the government to establish an international humanitarian corridor to protect aid deliveries and civilians in Gaza.</p>
