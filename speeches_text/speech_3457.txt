<p data-HoCid="8219200" data-originallang="en">That's a great question. This is where my recommendation about funding water-tech accelerators like Foresight and AquaAction and some of the other agencies we talked about is, because we de-risk it. There is a lot of risk aversion right now in Canada, whereas if you look at Israel, Israel will adopt 90% of start-ups. They'll take that risk because the ones that hit are the ones that are actually making a big difference. They recycle 90% of their water, whereas Canada recycles less than 10%.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8219201" data-originallang="en">What we're asking for is an investment from the federal government to support accelerators like us regionally. We de-risk. We can make sure that we place them in the right place in the market, and we make sure they have an impact. Those are the hands and the eyes and ears of the federal government on the ground floor, so that we can accelerate that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8219202" data-originallang="en">In Canada, because everything is federal, it's very difficult to manage what happens on the ground. Sometimes what happens on the ground is chaos for these entrepreneurs. They have all the barriers that hit them. That's why we can't get far. We really need to create more of a process from funding all the way down to the ground, where we hit them with what they need to make sure they are successful on the commercial market.</p>
