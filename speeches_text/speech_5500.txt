<p data-HoCid="8703183" data-originallang="en">The number one answer to this question is whether it is the right of the Palestinian people to be recognized. As a Palestinian today, I feel we are long overdue. We have suffered so long. We paid the price for being recognized. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8703184" data-originallang="en">Palestinians are one of the most well-educated people in the Middle East. They deserve to be recognized and be part of the international community. Canada, by delaying this recognition, puts us Palestinians on the table of negotiations, waiting for a negotiation as a sub-element of this negotiation.</p>

You cannot work from a village, just as you can't come from Kanata to downtown Ottawa. </p>
