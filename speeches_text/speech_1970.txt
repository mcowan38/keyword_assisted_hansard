<p data-HoCid="7414846" data-originallang="en">What I want to say first is that I'm a defender of big tech's freedom to engage in content moderation and particularly when it comes to keeping anti-Semitism or inflammatory violence.... Hopefully, we could agree that any comments that incite violence should be under the domain of the platform and they should have the free rights to restrict and to engage in content moderation. I don't think that the JCPA at least infringes on their ability to do so. But in terms of the effect on broadcasters, I think you have a similar power imbalance where broadcasters are not being paid fair market value.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7414847" data-originallang="en">Interestingly, I would point out that broadcasters in the U.S. version of the bill did not want the same protections as the newspapers, and so the bill in the U.S. is written in such a way as to give them some mild protection, but they don't have this binding arbitration, baseball style arbitration, in which someone could actually compel a negotiation and compel a final payment to be made. That doesn't apply to the broadcasters, at least in the U.S. version.</p>
