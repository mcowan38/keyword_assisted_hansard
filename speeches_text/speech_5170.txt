<p data-HoCid="8679454" data-originallang="en"> Look, I can only surmise a guess based on my read. I think it's because the Canadians are bound in their foreign policy when it comes to this issue to the Washington consensus. The position of Washington for a long time, because it is so close to the Israelis, is to say that you cannot have the establishment of a Palestinian state and, therefore, the recognition of said state by other countries unless you have a negotiated resolution.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679455" data-originallang="en">As I have said, this runs completely counter to relevant principles of international law. The Palestinian people are a people juridically. They have a right to self-determination. Their self-determination unit is the occupied Palestinian territory. They have a right to establish a state in that territory to the exclusion of all other peoples. Israel is not sovereign in that territory. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679456" data-originallang="en">The principal judicial organ of the UN has determined that Israel has an obligation to withdraw from that territory “as rapidly as possible”. The General Assembly on September 18, 2024, with the passage of emergency special session resolution ES-10/24 has indicated that this means that September 17, 2025, is the deadline by which Israel must withdraw from the territory. That's international law. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679457" data-originallang="en">There's no reason why the Canadians should not recognize...absent these negotiations, which will never happen. The historical record is very clear. Let's take the Israelis seriously for what they say and do.</p>
