<p data-HoCid="7988566" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7988567" data-originallang="en">I want to thank the witnesses who are here today from foreign affairs, etc. I want to thank you for your ability to rapidly respond to the problem and to be on the ground, as always, making sure that you lever the right questions and help Canadians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988568" data-originallang="en">However, I know a lot of Canadians who felt that during the early days of this conflict, they couldn't get any answers from the link and from the phone number that was there to get to people on the ground from Canada. I think you've said that this has been fixed and very few people are trying to call out.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988569" data-originallang="en"> I wanted to ask you about this. We've heard from everyone that the only way to get humanitarian aid through would be from Rafah. How is the Israeli-Egyptian relationship getting along? I know Cairo had a meeting on the weekend. Is there tension in the relationship between Israel and Egypt? I know that Egypt was afraid that there would be bombing along Rafah and they didn't want to sent any aid across that corridor. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7988570" data-originallang="en">What is happening? Is that a stable relationship now? Does everyone feel that Rafah will be open for movement of humanitarian aid? </p>
