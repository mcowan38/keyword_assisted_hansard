<p data-HoCid="6468153" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, today marks International Holocaust Remembrance Day. Today, let us remember the millions of lives lost, and may their memories be a blessing. Let us think of those who survived and the families whose lives were shattered forever. It is for those we lost, those who survived and their families that we must continue to do the work necessary and honour our commitment of “never again”. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6468154" data-originallang="en">Sadly, we see a continued rise in anti-Semitic attacks year over year. There is still much work to be done, but I am proud to be part of the multipartisan international task force on combatting online anti-Semitism with elected officials across the globe. As members of Parliament, it is our duty and responsibility to ensure that the hateful acts that led to the Holocaust never happen again. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6468155" data-originallang="en">Today, on behalf of the Conservative Party of Canada, I pledge our unwavering commitment to “never again”.</p>
