<p data-HoCid="7602165" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7602166" data-originallang="en">Thank you to our witnesses for being here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7602167" data-originallang="en">This is, obviously, a concern to all members of the committee and to the Canadian public, I think, writ large. We've seen more and more instances of anti-Semitic hate and all other forms of toxic hate. A year ago on Parliament Hill, a Nazi flag, which is a despicable symbol of genocidal violence, was waved during the so-called “freedom convoy”. This is something that all Canadians have to be concerned about: the rise in anti-Semitism and the rise in hate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7602168" data-originallang="en"> I've introduced a private member's bill, Bill <a data-HoCid="11471425" href="/bills/44-1/C-229/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (banning symbols of hate)">C-229</a>, to ban those symbols of hate, like the Nazi flag that represents nothing more than the genocidal violence and hate that led to the Holocaust.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7602169" data-originallang="en">The concerns, I think, are very legitimate. The fact that this anti-Semitism was funded by the federal government, funded by the taxpayers, I find unbelievable.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7602170" data-originallang="en">I want to understand that changes have been made to ensure that this never happens again. I listened very carefully to your testimony—thank you, Ms. Khanna—that there are new procedures that have been put into place. I think you referred to a deeper assessment that actually includes individuals as well as organizations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7602171" data-originallang="en"> Would you suggest that all of those procedures are now in place? It was unclear to me whether the department was still considering that or whether the department had put in place concrete measures.</p>
