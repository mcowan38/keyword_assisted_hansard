<p data-HoCid="8435306" data-originallang="en"> It's obvious that every Canadian student, no matter what their background, needs to enjoy the right to feel safe in a safe and welcoming learning environment, where they can go about unobstructed and enjoy that academic freedom. I think so many witnesses have underlined that this is so important to our democracy as a whole. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8435307" data-originallang="en">Out of this committee's studies and what we've heard from witnesses, there are obviously going to be some short-term, medium-term and long-term recommendations to the government. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8435308" data-originallang="en">In the immediate term, given that the security is so absent for so many Jewish students and academics, what would you like to see to try to bolster the security for Jewish students presently? Is there anything that you'd like to see us recommend to the federal government? </p>
