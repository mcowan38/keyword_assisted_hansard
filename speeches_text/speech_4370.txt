<p data-HoCid="8453335" data-originallang="en"> The Liberal caucus, of which you are a part, voted in favour of our motion in March, calling on the ceasing of further authorization and transfer of arms exports in Israel. We know that the majority of Canadian exports to Israel's military are in space and satellite technology.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8453336" data-originallang="en">Therefore, I was shocked earlier this month when I asked, within this committee, Space Canada and MDA Space what communications they've received from your department and the government on this. They have not seen any promised notes to exporters, nor have they received any communications from your department on their prospective sales in Israel. Will your government issue this notice?</p>
