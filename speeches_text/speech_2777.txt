<p data-HoCid="7963905" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, it is with immense pride that I rise to mark an exceptional occasion: the 100th anniversary of Premier Tech, based in Rivière-du-Loup. Premier Tech has forged a reputation for excellence with 100 years of history, determination and daring.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7963906" data-originallang="fr">The story began when the Bélanger family purchased a small business. It moved into horticulture with sphagnum peat moss and is now known for automation and waste water treatment.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7963907" data-originallang="fr">Premier Tech employs 5,200 people in 28 countries, has 48 plants and generates sales of over $1 billion. The company is deeply committed to its home community, but it is also involved internationally in the world of cycling. The Israel-Premier Tech team has achieved major successes, including at the Tour de France with Canadian cyclists.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7963908" data-originallang="fr">I would like to commend my friends Bernard Bélanger and his son Jean, who, through their hard work and vision, have shaped our community and made a positive impact on a global scale.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7963909" data-originallang="fr">I wish Premier Tech a bright and prosperous future, and happy hundredth anniversary to the company and its teams.</p>
