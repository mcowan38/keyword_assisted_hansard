<p data-HoCid="8455639" data-originallang="en"> I've provided you an article that I wrote on the distinction between protected speech and hate speech.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455640" data-originallang="en">I want to say simply that there are clear demarcations between the two. The example that I usually give is that, if someone wants to criticize Israel's policies, its practices, the conduct of its government and so on and so forth, that's contemplated by the IHRA definition as not being anti-Semitic. A democracy should welcome that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455641" data-originallang="en">I can tell you as a member of the Jewish community that I've been sharply critical of the Israeli government where it's appropriate. The difference is when one says that all Zionists are racist, all Zionists are evil, and Israel should be wiped off the map. That transcends protected speech, and now we're in the realm of hate speech.</p>
