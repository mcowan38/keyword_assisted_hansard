<p data-HoCid="6626326" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to be here today and to contribute to this debate on Bill <a data-HoCid="10950130" href="/bills/43-2/C-11/" title="An Act to enact the Consumer Privacy Protection Act and the Personal Information and Data Protection Tribunal Act and to make consequential and related amendments to other Acts">C-11</a>. I have been here for four years. It is hard to believe, as I just had my anniversary on April 3, that I have been serving the good people of Calgary Midnapore for four years, which I am so fortunate to do. At this point in my political career, if I do not believe that the messengers themselves are sincere, I have a hard time believing the message. It is really hard for me to think about and understand a policy if I do not have a lot of good faith in the individual or entity from which it is coming.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6626327" data-originallang="en"> There stems one of the two struggles that I have with this bill: I do not genuinely believe in the sincerity of the current government to protect Canadians. I have seen this from many perspectives, both past and present. My second concern is a sort of generalization, but it still remains that I see the government doing things in a half-hearted effort. This is along the same lines as my first point about insincerity.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6626328" data-originallang="en">When I refer to my past experience with this, I am drawing upon my time as the shadow minister for democratic institutions. Bill <a data-HoCid="10950130" href="/bills/43-2/C-11/" title="An Act to enact the Consumer Privacy Protection Act and the Personal Information and Data Protection Tribunal Act and to make consequential and related amendments to other Acts">C-11</a> is relevant to that because, during my time as shadow minister, the Digital Charter was announced. If not legislation, this was certainly an important policy announcement that was supposed to carry a lot of weight. At the time, we were debating Bill <a data-HoCid="9808070" href="/bills/42-1/C-76/" title="An Act to amend the Canada Elections Act and other Acts and to make certain consequential amendments">C-76</a>, which would have major implications for future elections. The digital conversation, along with foreign interference and foreign influence, had a lot to contribute to the discussion around Bill C-76.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6626329" data-originallang="en">When the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry made his announcement at that time, along with the minister of democratic institutions, it felt very flat. It felt as though it was one of those commercials for children on a Saturday morning or, since the current government likes to insult Conservative institutions so much, perhaps a video from PragerU. It really did not come across with a lot of sincerity or a lot of teeth. It just seemed to do what the government likes to do, which is a lot of virtue signalling.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6626330" data-originallang="en">This bill also reminds me of the tribunal composition. It always concerns me a little when the government creates a body that has any type of implication in the direction of Canadians' lives or industry. I am thinking of the Leaders' Debates Commission, which I believe significantly impacted the debates framework in the last election. I recall the question from the member of Parliament for <a data-HoCid="252545" href="/politicians/ted-falk/" title="Ted Falk">Provencher</a> to the previous speaker. If we look back now, the debates commission included one of the Kielburger brothers. It is very interesting that we find this here today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6626331" data-originallang="en">One thing I am concerned about within the framework of the Bill <a data-HoCid="10950130" href="/bills/43-2/C-11/" title="An Act to enact the Consumer Privacy Protection Act and the Personal Information and Data Protection Tribunal Act and to make consequential and related amendments to other Acts">C-11</a> legislation is that the current government members always find a way to take care of their friends. We have seen this with SNC-Lavalin, which we are still dealing with the implications of here today as we go through the pandemic; with Mr. Baylis, the former member of Parliament; and, as has been alluded to before, the WE Charity scandal, which the previous speaker indicated. Unfortunately, this legislation is being sent to ethics rather than industry in an effort to delay that. Even in the context of Bill C-11 and what this is supposed to do, I worry about government members taking care of their friends.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6626332" data-originallang="en">I mentioned that the second part of my concern was that the current government does everything half-heartedly. I believe that includes this legislation, without question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6626333" data-originallang="en">We look at the possibility of information being shared with other parties. The bill would allow an organization to transfer an individual's personal information to a service provider without their knowledge or consent. Regarding the right to have the collecting party delete collected information on request, it somewhat deals with that, but when I have tried to unsubscribe, in some situations it has definitely been unsuccessful.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6626334" data-originallang="en">We also see in the bill the right to opt out of the sale of personal information where an organization may transfer an individual's personal information to a service provider, again, without their consent or knowledge. This is a theme that I am seeing in terms of the government addressing things half-heartedly and Bill <a data-HoCid="10950130" href="/bills/43-2/C-11/" title="An Act to enact the Consumer Privacy Protection Act and the Personal Information and Data Protection Tribunal Act and to make consequential and related amendments to other Acts">C-11</a> definitely falls within this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6626335" data-originallang="en">Also, we have seen this half-hearted response with the pandemic from the very beginning in terms of the government's eliminating the warning system prior to the pandemic's arrival; the return of personal protective equipment, which showed such a lack of foresight for the necessity of its use not months later; and the slow closing of borders that we saw at the very beginning, and in my position as shadow minister for transport I have seen incredible, draconian measures that were inserted at a result of poor response earlier on. It is the same with any situation when the longer we allow something to fester, the greater the response it requires later on. Unfortunately, Canadians are paying the price of the inaction. There is also the rapid testing and of course vaccines, which is a complete failure of the government and of the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> . </p>
<p data-HoCid="6626336" data-originallang="en">I want to say to any Canadian who is listening to this speech, if they are upset because their business is closed, their children are at home and not at school, they have not seen their family in 18 months, there is a third wave, it is the fault of the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> for so poorly preparing for the later stages of this pandemic. This is another half-hearted response that I have referred to.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6626337" data-originallang="en">We have also seen this unfortunately within the defence committee. The government was willing to turn its back on women all across the country in not believing the stories and yet it is willing to investigate the unfortunate situation of the member for <a data-HoCid="252653" href="/politicians/william-amos/" title="William Amos">Pontiac</a>, who is an incredible individual might I say. My husband and I had the good fortune of travelling to Israel with him and I will stand in solidarity with him. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6626338" data-originallang="en">In kindergarten, I was painting a picture and when I was done, I had taken off my smock and was standing there in my slip when my good friend, Kim Crocker, who I later had the pleasure of serving with in student council with in high school said to me, “You're standing there in your slip” as all the fine women of <a data-HoCid="252807" href="/politicians/stephanie-kusie/" title="Stephanie Kusie">Calgary Midnapore</a> did wear at that time. My point is the Liberals have turned their backs on women at the defence committee as well.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6626339" data-originallang="en">If there is something good to be said about this piece of legislation, in my capacity as shadow minister for transport, many right-to-repair organizations and the small repair shops across rural and suburban Canada have said that Canadians have the right to own their data.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6626340" data-originallang="en">Colleagues within the Conservative Party will argue that this is a property right and a human right. As we advance in the digital age, I believe more and more that this is a human right, that our history of data will one day be almost synonymous with our DNA.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6626341" data-originallang="en">I will leave it there. I do not believe in the government's sincerity of protecting Canadians. I believe that so much that the Liberals do is a half-hearted effort. For both of these reasons, I stand here today in regard to Bill <a data-HoCid="10950130" href="/bills/43-2/C-11/" title="An Act to enact the Consumer Privacy Protection Act and the Personal Information and Data Protection Tribunal Act and to make consequential and related amendments to other Acts">C-11</a> with a lot of questions about the legislation, but the belief that I am not certain whether this legislation goes far enough.</p>
