<p data-HoCid="8499228" data-originallang="en">As I said, because Islamophobia is intersectional, and because your committee is seeking to gather knowledge and information to make better recommendations to government, I would suggest.... I actually would like to question why there are no Palestinian voices included today, or Palestinian experts. You need to get information from the right sources. Not to hear from Palestinians on this issue is very troubling. It's very troubling there hasn't been an inclusion of Palestinian scholars and experts. Start with that as you gather your information.</p>
