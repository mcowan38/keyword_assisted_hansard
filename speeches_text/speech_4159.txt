<p data-HoCid="8406386" data-originallang="en"> This is a regular thing. The attempt to ban Jewish student organizations on campuses is not a new thing. Everyone wants us to think this is a new thing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8406387" data-originallang="en">I come from the U.K. originally. There were attempts to ban Jewish societies on campus in the U.K. from as early as 1973, especially after the UN passed its infamous “Zionism is racism” resolution in 1975. That became a really serious thing that Jewish students had to deal with in the U.K. for 25 years.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8406388" data-originallang="en">We've come out the other side of it. Coming here, it is shocking. There is a lot more that can be done right now. Seeing my organization, Hillel, called a Zionist cultural institution, and therefore not allowed on campus, is just laughable to me.</p>
