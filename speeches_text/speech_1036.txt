<p data-HoCid="6748298" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> speaks from both sides of his mouth when defending our rights and freedoms. Last year, he attended a public protest in Ottawa, a violation of Ontario's emergency measures, yet he also claims lockdown protesters spread COVID, as if COVID spreads only at rallies he does not like.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6748299" data-originallang="en">He has affirmed the right of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters who were not ticketed by police, yet I, as a sitting MP, received two court summons for attending other peaceful outdoor protests.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6748300" data-originallang="en"> Can the government confirm the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> is in favour of all Canadians' right to peacefully protest, or just the causes he personally endorses?</p>
