<p data-HoCid="7427226" data-originallang="en"> Good afternoon, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7427227" data-originallang="en">My name is Gary Gladstone. I am the lead of stakeholder relations at Reena as well as the convenor of the Intentional Community Consortium.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7427228" data-originallang="en">Reena, celebrating our 50th anniversary next year, promotes dignity, individuality, independence, personal growth and community inclusion for people with diverse abilities within a framework of Jewish culture and values. Open to all, Reena provides supportive housing, programming and employment services to over 1,000 individuals with developmental disabilities, including autism and those with mental health challenges.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7427229" data-originallang="en">The Intentional Community Consortium represents 26 agencies that are advocating and building not-for-profit, deeply affordable housing for the most vulnerable in society: those with developmental disabilities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7427230" data-originallang="en">Reena is the fourth-largest developmental service provider in Ontario, currently operating 32 group homes and supporting an additional 140 individuals in supported independent living units. There are 252 community participants in our daily programming, with over 700 full- and part-time employees. Reena has an overall budget of $75 million.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7427231" data-originallang="en">On behalf of those we support with varied abilities and specifically those with developmental disabilities and severe mental health challenges, I am pleased to be present to support Bill <a data-HoCid="11826019" href="/bills/44-1/C-22/" title="An Act to reduce poverty and to support the financial security of persons with disabilities by establishing the Canada disability benefit and making a consequential amendment to the Income Tax Act">C-22</a>, an act to reduce poverty and to support the financial security of persons with disabilities by establishing the Canada disability benefit and making a consequential amendment to the Income Tax Act. I request that this legislation be passed as soon as possible, with a tight timeline of six months to complete regulations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7427232" data-originallang="en"> As I thank <a data-HoCid="278928" href="/politicians/carla-qualtrough/" title="Carla Qualtrough">Minister Carla Qualtrough </a> for bringing this important legislation forward, I would also like to thank all members and parties in the House for expediting this bill through the House to committee to have a full discussion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7427233" data-originallang="en">About 100,000 Ontario adults have a developmental disability. Eighteen per cent to 30% of people in homeless shelters have a developmental disability. Fifty per cent of those with developmental disabilities live with significant medical issues. Ninety per cent of those with developmental disabilities live below the poverty line and require deeply affordable rent for adequate housing, with supports that amount to about $522 in Ontario. Women with a developmental disability are 65% more likely to experience abuse than a typical female.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7427234" data-originallang="en">Honourable members of the committee, as I have said to you before, there is a waiting list of over 40 years for housing with supports for those with developmental disabilities, although things are getting a bit better, thanks to the targeted carve-out of the national housing strategy for this targeted vulnerable community.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7427235" data-originallang="en">Bill <a data-HoCid="11826019" href="/bills/44-1/C-22/" title="An Act to reduce poverty and to support the financial security of persons with disabilities by establishing the Canada disability benefit and making a consequential amendment to the Income Tax Act">C-22</a> is a vital piece of legislation that will impact the lives of those we support and those with disabilities from coast to coast to coast. We need to pass this legislation as soon as possible with all-party support so that we can immediately get working on the regulations that will address critical issues about the design and structure of the benefit.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7427236" data-originallang="en">I would urge that the following be in the regulations. Number one is a safeguard against provincial and territorial government clawbacks, as we want to ensure that there is a net benefit and that there will not be a clawback from the provinces of any additional funds provided by the federal government.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7427237" data-originallang="en">Number two is indexing for inflation. As inflation and the increased cost of living are on everyone’s mind now, it's imperative that any benefit be indexed to the rate of inflation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7427238" data-originallang="en">Number three is that we would also like to see representatives from the disabled community at the table when decisions are made with respect to Bill <a data-HoCid="11826019" href="/bills/44-1/C-22/" title="An Act to reduce poverty and to support the financial security of persons with disabilities by establishing the Canada disability benefit and making a consequential amendment to the Income Tax Act">C-22</a>, as well as all disability acts and regulations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7427239" data-originallang="en">It's imperative that we enact the bill and work on the regulations immediately so that we can get the benefits out to the most vulnerable, those who need them now, as soon as possible. Reena and the Intentional Community Consortium recommend that a deadline for the recommendations and actionable items be no more than six months.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7427240" data-originallang="en">In preparation for this presentation, I have read briefs from many outstanding organizations in the disability sector. I would like it noted that Reena and the Intentional Community Consortium share some of the concerns of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act Alliance. We would like them addressed—without slowing down the passage of this legislation, when possible—within six months, to ensure that the benefit gets out the door as soon as possible.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7427241" data-originallang="en">“A nation's greatness is measured by how it treats its weakest members” is a quote attributed to Mahatma Gandhi. Through the proposed act, you can ensure that Canada takes care of those who cannot advocate for themselves. With your support, we need to ensure that those with developmental disabilities are never left behind again. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7427242" data-originallang="en">Thank you for the opportunity to speak in support of Bill <a data-HoCid="11826019" href="/bills/44-1/C-22/" title="An Act to reduce poverty and to support the financial security of persons with disabilities by establishing the Canada disability benefit and making a consequential amendment to the Income Tax Act">C-22</a> with the request that it be quickly passed into law, with unanimous all-party support, with regulations brought forth within six months. </p>
