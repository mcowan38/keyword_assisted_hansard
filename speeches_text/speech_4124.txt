<p data-HoCid="8406091" data-originallang="en"> Anti-Semitism has always been a conspiracy myth. It puts the Jew in the position of what is considered evil in society. Society has changed, and what we consider evil changes. I think it's great that we have more of a cultural awareness of discrimination and of hatred toward all people, but Jews, because of the way anti-Semitism functions, are put as the oppressor, which is what is considered evil in our society.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8406092" data-originallang="en"> That's a good thing that we're being aware of discrimination and oppression, but Jews are put in the position where we are seen as helping that. That's why, I think, there's a lot of anti-Semitism in society and how it continues to be that way.</p>
