<p data-HoCid="8139102" data-originallang="en">For example, you will often hear the government say that it doesn't support increases to development assistance because there isn't public support for that, yet we see, for example, with the call for a ceasefire in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, a Mainstreet poll that says that 71% of Canadians do support a ceasefire, and the government chooses not to do that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8139103" data-originallang="en">We pick and choose when we want to use public opinion as a legitimizing force for our foreign policy, which is obviously a very big problem.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8139104" data-originallang="en">We're also talking today about diplomacy, though, and Canada's diplomatic role, and I would say, too, that what we have here is a focus on trade, which I think is important. However, from my perspective, trade is a reward you get when you do the hard work of diplomacy, development and all these other foreign policy issues, which I don't think we've done.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8139105" data-originallang="en">Could you talk a little about that and perhaps about how some of the things that we see Canadian companies doing abroad are quite detrimental to our reputation? How might they harm our bigger foreign policy goals?</p>
