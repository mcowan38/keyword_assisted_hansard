<p data-HoCid="8301044" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301045" data-originallang="fr">I'd like to begin by thanking Mr. Housefather for moving his motion. I think it expresses a concern that many of us share, more or less everywhere throughout Quebec and Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301046" data-originallang="fr">Each and every person should be able to live out their religious beliefs in peace and freedom. I don't think that religious or moral beliefs, apostolic or otherwise, should divide people. Whatever the religion, it should be a set of values that brings people together, not divides them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301047" data-originallang="fr">I have a great deal of respect, fondness and sympathy for members of the Jewish community, given what they're going through at the moment. I don't want to stray too far from the debate, but Quebec has a state secularism law. I've had discussions with many friends of the Jewish faith, as well as some of the Muslim faith. There are extremists in all faiths, but I would say that 99% of people agree that the state should be secular and that everyone should be able to practice their religion in peace, respect and solidarity.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301048" data-originallang="fr">I don't have anything to add to the debate, but I would like to say that I agree with what Mr. Housefather and Mr. Mendicino have said. These things are important.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301049" data-originallang="fr">You can count on the support of the Bloc Québécois on these issues.</p>
