<p data-HoCid="8784217" data-originallang="en"> Library and Archives Canada must release the names from the DeschÃªnes commission report. All documents related to Canada's Nazi past must be released to our public so we can learn and educate ourselves about the trauma inflicted by Canada on the survivors of the Holocaust, and so that, as a society, we can grow and learn from the mistakes of our past.</p>
