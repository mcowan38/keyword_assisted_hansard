<p data-HoCid="8561715" data-originallang="en">That upholding of international law against Putin's targeting of children, of civilians and infrastructure, is effective. We have to stand up to that, of course, and I know this is the case across all parties. We support international law; that's key. The ICC and the ICJ are working to investigate Putin and to hold him accountable. However, this isn't the only crisis that we've seen across the world. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8561716" data-originallang="en">This summer, I've heard from many Palestinian Canadians who are disgusted that the government, and the Conservatives as well, refuse to recognize the ongoing genocide in Gaza. Many of those civilians, hospitals and children are being targeted. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8561717" data-originallang="en">How can the Canadian government stand strong in terms of that upholding of international law if we don't do it consistently? </p>
