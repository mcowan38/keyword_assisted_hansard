<p data-HoCid="7125347" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125348" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much to all the witnesses who came today. Your testimony was incredibly compelling.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125349" data-originallang="en">I think it's important to note something about the groups that are here today: The Jewish community has been in this country for over 260 years, and the Black community has been here for hundreds of years. There's a proud legacy of contributions that all of these different communities have made to Canada, and nobody deserves to face hate in their own country. No. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7125350" data-originallang="en">There are a lot of things that I can say, and one is that Canada has a very low rate of anti-Semitism overall. If you look at Pew studies, you see that compared to other countries, the rate of anti-Semitism overall in Canada is low. In fact, in the Angus Reid poll that was done last week, you saw that the Jewish community had the highest favourability of any religious community in Canada. At the same time, as a Jewish Canadian in the last federal election, I was shocked to see that every day of my campaign, new Nazi swastikas appeared on my posters. Never had I had that in my life in this country. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7125351" data-originallang="en">Last May, during the conflict between Israel and Hamas, for the very first time I had constituents who asked me if it was safe for their children to play in parks wearing a kippah. Holocaust survivors would come to me and ask, “Should I take the mezuzah off my door so that nobody can know I'm Jewish?” Every group in this country should be able to be visible and proud in Canada, and we should not be ashamed of our religions; they should be allowed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125352" data-originallang="en">Coming to that, I want to get to the questions that I had, because it's really important to understand what hate is and to make sure that we're not going overboard in terms of free speech. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7125353" data-originallang="en"> Daniel, it was really interesting to hear what you said about hundreds of symbols and how they change all the time. There are a few core ones, whether it's the Confederate flag or the Nazi swastika—and I'll be careful saying the “Nazi” swastika—or some others. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7125354" data-originallang="en">I'd like to hear from the witnesses. Do you believe, based on sections 318 and 319 of the Criminal Code, that it would already be covered, or would the explicit mention of, for example, the use of the Confederate flag or the Nazi swastika be subject to the religious exceptions and other exceptions that have to be made? Would it be a useful addition to the Criminal Code as it was proposed in my friend Mr. Julian's bill? Maybe you can just go one after the other.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125355" data-originallang="en">Go ahead, Mr. Marceau.</p>
