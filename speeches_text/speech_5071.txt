<p data-HoCid="8660452" data-originallang="en"> I'd like to refer to an ABC News article dated October 18, 2023, titled “US says initial independent review shows no evidence of bomb strike on Gaza hospital”. I want to read the first paragraph of this article.</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8660453" data-originallang="en"> A day after the Hamas-led Gaza Health Ministry claimed Israel had attacked the Al Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, saying some 500 Palestinians had been killed, Israeli and U.S. officials, explosive experts, and President Joe Biden said Wednesday an available evidence shows the destruction was caused instead by a failed Palestinian terrorist rocket launch. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8660454" data-originallang="en">I'm going to end that quote from that story there. However, I would then like to refer to a tweet on October 17, 2023, posted on X by Canada's <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">foreign affairs minister</a>. It says:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8660455" data-originallang="en"> Bombing a hospital is an unthinkable act, and there is no doubt that doing so is absolutely illegal. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8660456" data-originallang="en">Now, that was viewed 2.7 million times, and I want to draw to your attention the context that existed at the time. That goes back to this ABC article's opening graph that talks about that initial claim, and that initial claim was that Israel had perpetrated an attack on a civilian site, killing 500 civilians, innocents, in that war. That was reported by mainstream news outlets across the west, including here in Canada, and many, if not all, issued some form of correction.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8660457" data-originallang="en">However, with regard to the tweet that I read to you from Canada's <a data-HoCid="278529" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">foreign affairs minister</a>, I just read that and wrote it down in the last five minutes, so that tweet is still up, viewed 2.7 million times. Now, how harmful is this? Frankly, it's recklessness from a government verified account. Now, on the platform X, there are different types of verification, and one of them is from a government official or an elected official. This has the gray check mark. Talk about the disruption that foreign or hostile state actors seek to create. It's not necessarily to favour one political ideology or another.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8660458" data-originallang="en">I think, Professor Bradshaw, you talked about a very contentious time in 2020 in the U.S., the BLM riots, and the same hostile states were sponsoring or fomenting both supporters of BLM but also supporters of Blue Lives Matter, trying to create discord between two groups in a very tense situation, a tense time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8660459" data-originallang="en">So, with regard to this example here, do you believe that this type of failure to act after a hot take, which can happen on social media, enables hostile foreign states to create the kind of division that, frankly, we've seen in Canada in the face of this ongoing war in the Middle East?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8660460" data-originallang="en">I'll start with you, Professor Bradshaw.</p>
