<p data-HoCid="7300283" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, Sunday evening at sundown will mark Rosh Hashanah, which is the Jewish new year. It is a time of celebration and renewal as families and loved ones come together around the world to rejoice in the year ahead. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7300284" data-originallang="en">On Rosh Hashanah, we are asked as a community to prepare to build a new year. The 10 days leading to Yom Kippur allow us to reflect on how we will instill the coming year with life and goodness, and to fashion a new and different year with kindness and compassion, a year that allows us to stand up for one another and to protect those who are most vulnerable among us.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7300285" data-originallang="en">As we start this new season in Parliament, the spirit of Rosh Hashanah is one we can all reflect on, as members of the House, to shape a year and a country that looks out for all Canadians. From me and my family to our community in York Centre and Jewish families from coast to coast to coast, <em>shanah tova umetukah</em>: a sweet year to all.</p>
