<p data-HoCid="8714799" data-originallang="en"> I hope you're as generous with your minute and a half as you were with my colleague's. Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714800" data-originallang="en"> I'm curious about some of the comments that you've made, but there's one thing I want to start with. Legally, the State of Palestine already exists. I think it's important that we do recognize here that Palestine exists; what we're talking about right now is Canada's recognition of Palestine. The state exists, so we are not creating a state. This is not what we're talking about. It's the recognition by Canada. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8714801" data-originallang="en">You talked about the right to defence, so I have some questions for you on the right to defence being a legal ability. What about the attacks on UN workers? What about collective punishment? We also know that innocent civilians have the right to not be punished for the behaviours of terrorists within their realm. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8714802" data-originallang="en">Would you say, for example, that Israel's response in Gaza, where we have seen tens of thousands of innocent lives lost, is within Israel's right to defence, or do you think that it is collective punishment and has strayed beyond the right to defence into a war crime and, I would argue, a genocide? </p>
