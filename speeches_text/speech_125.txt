<p data-HoCid="6111922" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for giving me the opportunity to speak here today on this important issue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6111923" data-originallang="en">We certainly are in unprecedented times. It is remarkable for me to be here today representing my own riding while also carrying the weight of those living in the ridings of my Green Party colleagues, the member for <a data-HoCid="252941" href="/politicians/elizabeth-may/" title="Elizabeth May">Saanich—Gulf Islands</a> and <a data-HoCid="252987" href="/politicians/paul-manly/" title="Paul Manly">Nanaimo—Ladysmith</a>. I have also been asked to share these comments on behalf of the independent member for <a data-HoCid="253061" href="/politicians/jody-wilson-raybould/" title="Jody Wilson-Raybould">Vancouver Granville</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6111924" data-originallang="en">I would first like to acknowledge that we are on the unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinabe people. It is essential that we remember the historical and ongoing implications of those words and the responsibilities we bear toward indigenous communities across the nation, especially as we face this unprecedented crisis.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6111925" data-originallang="en">I know I am not alone in having made this bizarre trek to Ottawa to be present here for these proceedings. I made the 10-hour trip by car with my husband and two boys.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6111926" data-originallang="fr">We stopped only to get gas and take a break. We followed all the recommended hygiene measures.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6111927" data-originallang="en"> Of course, we did our best to entertain a toddler and a seven-year-old for 10 hours in the car. I think of the many families and households across the nation who are answering difficult questions from their children and trying to keep them entertained. I feel that too. I want to let the children of Canada know we love them and we are here for them too. We know this is a difficult time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6111928" data-originallang="en">I would like to take this opportunity to also humbly thank many, many people: the front-line workers staffing our hospitals, stocking our grocery stores and keeping our communities safe; the businesses and educational institutions that are answering the call and mobilizing in a warlike effort to provide and manufacture and supplies that we need; Dr. Tam and her team for coordinating our public health response, as well as Dr. Bonnie Henry of B.C. for her incredible work; the tireless efforts of our cabinet ministers and their staff to coordinate a response to COVID-19 across government departments; and my colleagues here in this House and those practising social distancing at home for proving that in the face of a national crisis, we can and will work together for the people of this country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6111929" data-originallang="en">We gather in these extraordinary times to pass extraordinary legislation. It will allow the federal government to reach out and help Canadians directly with their personal finances. It will allow help to reach the self-employed, small and medium-sized businesses and large corporations. I am very relieved that a compromise was found that allows us to pass this legislation today, albeit a bit later than we had hoped.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6111930" data-originallang="en">It is a fundamental principle of Westminster parliamentary democracy that Parliament controls the public purse. We cannot, even in a public health emergency, convey unprecedented powers without any oversight and without any criteria limiting those powers to any government, no matter how well-intentioned.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6111931" data-originallang="en">This is a defining moment for our country. I am prouder than ever before to be Canadian and to see the expedited response to this crisis. I am also so proud to be from New Brunswick. I commend Premier Higgs and chief medical officer Jennifer Russell for declaring a state of emergency. To the decision-makers of the neighbouring Atlantic provinces of Nova Scotia, P.E.I. and Newfoundland, I commend them all for making the difficult decision to close provincial borders to further protect citizens. I thank them for their leadership.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6111932" data-originallang="en">We have now seen more than a week of social distancing, of closures and restrictions. It is now the time for all Canadians to comply and do our part to get us through this together. Effective suppression would mean fewer cases of coronavirus, a fighting chance for our health care system and the humans who run it, a reduction in the number of total fatalities and a reduction in collateral damage. As well, it would give us the time for infected, isolated and quarantined health care workers to get better and return to work.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6111933" data-originallang="fr">Canada has been quick to respond so far. Inevitably there are lessons to be learned to ensure that we are better prepared for this type of disaster in the future.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6111934" data-originallang="en">I am here to work collaboratively with my colleagues in government, but I must also point out the ways we need to improve so that we can get this right for Canadians. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6111935" data-originallang="en">I am sure we are all in the same boat when it comes to the level of correspondence with our constituents over the past few weeks. We have been hearing a lot of concern. One thing the situation has made clear is the inequalities within our society. COVID-19 has amplified the challenges people are already facing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6111936" data-originallang="fr">I am thinking of the Canadians who are living in poverty, especially those who are homeless.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6111937" data-originallang="en">Working Canadians have been laid off or are facing reduced work hours, particularly at a time when they feel financially insecure. Older Canadians living on a fixed income are worried about their pensions and investments. Indigenous peoples are facing heightened challenges in their communities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6111938" data-originallang="fr">It is not easy for Canadians living in rural areas to access health care services.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6111939" data-originallang="en">Permanent residents and other newcomers worrying about family abroad are trying to get home amidst travel cancellations. Our charities and not-for-profit organizations are losing their donor base right now and really need our support. We must also stay vigilant against those who want to profit from this crisis, and they are out there.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6111940" data-originallang="en">We are facing this giant together, but from very different vantage points. Almost a million people have applied for employment insurance. Our Green Party has been proposing a guaranteed livable income for Canadians for years, and if we had a GLI in place now, we would easily be able to ramp up payments to people facing layoffs and reduced hours without clogging the phone lines of Service Canada and scaring people who are afraid in their unique situations, leaving them without support. The government measures announced are now taking time to roll out because we lack the infrastructure to quickly disseminate direct payments to Canadians. We need to have a closer look at this issue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6111941" data-originallang="en">It is also clear to me that if we had already made much-needed improvements to our health care system in areas that have been advocated by professionals, such as improved infrastructure, preventive health care and pharmacare, we would be much better situated to address the needs of Canadians in this COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6111942" data-originallang="en">Best estimates of what lies ahead vary widely. We can all agree that the more we are able to maintain social distancing among those who are asymptomatic and maintain isolation for those who have symptoms, the greater our chances are of getting through COVID-19 without overwhelming the system. The extent to which individual Canadians and businesses can follow the advice provided depends on the extent of their financial ability to do so. People have to be in a financially secure position in order to take the public health advice.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6111943" data-originallang="en">When we talk about the economic impacts, it seems we have left some things out. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6111944" data-originallang="en">We have discussed a few of them here today. Renters, both residential and commercial, need measures to protect them from landlords who are not passing along the goodwill of the banks or who do not have the goodwill of their bank. New Brunswick and a few other provinces have made it illegal to evict tenants for nonpayment of rent. These measures are good, but they need to be standardized across the country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6111945" data-originallang="fr">We must do more for the small and medium-sized businesses that keep our economy moving.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6111946" data-originallang="en">As Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, says of the wage subsidies, “It's the right measure, but it's the wrong amount.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="6111947" data-originallang="en"> Our assistance measures for businesses are being dwarfed by steps taken or being contemplated elsewhere. For example, in Denmark the government is offering up to 75% of wages, with the maximum payout per employee 10 times higher than the current offering in Canada. As well, there seems to be nothing for unincorporated businesses that have employees. This is a big concern.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6111948" data-originallang="en">New Brunswick is allowing small businesses to defer WorkSafe New Brunswick premiums for three months. The federal government could do the same for EI, CPP and HST.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6111949" data-originallang="en">These are trying times, but we do see examples of hope all across the country. I have seen jingle-dress dancers standing out in their yards dancing for all of our collective healing. I know that we have seen churches, synagogues, mosques and other places of worship adapting to a new reality and being steadfast in their support of spirituality and faith, which we need now more than ever.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6111950" data-originallang="en">These are emotional times for citizens as well, and we also must consider their mental health. We should get outside if we can, but we must maintain our social distancing. We can go for the online museum tours. Online zoo tours are happening. I have seen people making badminton nets out of tape. We can play Hide the Potato. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6111951" data-originallang="fr">I have also seen people making Portugese-style or Quebec-style tortillas. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6111952" data-originallang="en">We are finding really creative examples to deal with this crisis. Let us keep it up. I urge us all to call neighbours, check in, do FaceTime with grandparents. We all have a responsibility here. Let us stay connected. Isolation can be a really difficult thing for each of us to face.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6111953" data-originallang="en">Many of us are setting an example by operating from home as well, and we can continue to play a leadership role here by exploring digital options for the work we do here in the House. Let us continue to have that conversation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6111954" data-originallang="en">Today means passing this motion to ensure Canadians have the financial resources they need to make ends meet while we rigorously follow the advice of public health experts. We will get through this if we stick together, even if that means standing apart.</p>
