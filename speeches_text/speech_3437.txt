<p data-HoCid="8170754" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, this is a very serious situation. The <a data-HoCid="300012" href="/politicians/ahmed-hussen/" title="Ahmed Hussen">minister</a> acted immediately last week to pause funding to UNRWA. A pause means a pause. It means that, going forward, no Canadian funding will flow to UNRWA as the investigation unfolds. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8170755" data-originallang="en">In the meantime, our humanitarian commitment to helping the most vulnerable Palestinian civilians in the region remains unwavering. We are going to continue working with partners in the region to ensure that life-saving aid gets to those vulnerable civilians, and I encourage the member to support us in this.</p>
