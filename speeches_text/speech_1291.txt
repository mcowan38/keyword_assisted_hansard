<p class="procedural" data-HoCid="6875169"> moved for leave to introduce Bill <a data-HoCid="11471874" href="/bills/44-1/C-208/">C-208, An Act respecting early learning and child care</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6875170" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> for seconding this bill and for her work on this file.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6875171" data-originallang="en">There is an affordability crisis in this country. Being able to afford housing, food and other necessities is becoming increasingly difficult, and the pandemic has only exacerbated the struggles that many encounter. Families are struggling to find early learning and child care spaces and costs are not affordable in many cities. Parents are forced to make impossible choices between delaying their return to work and paying huge amounts for the child care they need.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6875172" data-originallang="en">After promising an affordable child care program for 28 years, I am glad to see that the Liberals are finally moving forward on their many promises. However, there is still a lack of critical details on the agreements signed with the provinces and the long-term stability and universality of this program.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6875173" data-originallang="en">I am tabling this bill today to establish the core principles of a universal early learning and child care program, one that is based on accountability, quality, universality and accessibility, and to establish the standards needed to meet these principles. I am calling on the government to work with us to continue to move child care forward. It is too important to get wrong.</p>
