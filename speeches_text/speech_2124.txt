<p data-HoCid="7549753" data-originallang="en">This year, many Canadian families and friends are finally able to gather safely together to celebrate this significant festival. I was grateful to join with many of my constituents as we counted down to the lunar new year and celebrated with street parades and lion dance performances. We even invited Asian Canadians from across our country yesterday to come to our nation's capital to commemorate this joyous occasion with my fellow members of Parliament and our <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7549754" data-originallang="en">During this celebration, let us take time to recognize the immense contributions Asian Canadians have made and remind ourselves how vibrant and multicultural Canada is.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7549755" data-originallang="en">I wish everyone success, prosperity and good health in the Year of the Rabbit.</p>
