<p data-HoCid="6169355" data-originallang="fr"> Mr. Speaker, I freely admit that I was surprised at the motion moved by our Conservative Party friends even though the Conservatives are always full of surprises. For example, they are taking full advantage of the Canada emergency wage subsidy even though they asked the government to make sure nobody undeserving could benefit from the government's measures. Few things the Conservative Party does should surprise us.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6169356" data-originallang="fr">When I read the motion carefully, it does not seem particularly objectionable at first glance. In recent months, we have all watched as the People's Republic of China used the Hong Kong administration to repress the pro-democracy movement. We were all appalled. Before the pandemic, the Special Committee on Canada-China Relations had plans to examine this issue and study the situation in Hong Kong.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6169357" data-originallang="fr">The previous speaker talked about what is happening with the Uighurs, Taiwan and Tibet. The Special Committee on Canada-China Relations was supposed to look at those issues too.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6169358" data-originallang="fr">Ignoring the fact that the committee intended to address the issue suggests some degree of intellectual dishonesty. One wonders why the motion denouncing the imprisonment of human rights advocates was referred to the Special Committee on Canada-China Relations under the guise of examining the security legislation the People's Republic of China is seeking to impose on Hong Kong. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6169359" data-originallang="fr">We agree that we must address the deeply worrisome law introduced by the Communist Party of China during its congress. We must insist that the People's Republic of China respect the one country, two systems agreement and that it keep the promises it made to the United Kingdom when the UK handed the territory over.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6169360" data-originallang="fr">We expect the People's Republic of China to keep its commitments. We can demand nothing less given its thinly veiled threats against the territory's independence. After the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong, we would have expected the situation to de-escalate, but such was not the case, since the People's Republic of China is taking advantage of the current pandemic to tighten its hold on the territory.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6169361" data-originallang="fr">I agree with our Conservative Party friends that the <a data-HoCid="253367" href="/politicians/francois-philippe-champagne/" title="FranÃ§ois-Philippe Champagne">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> must remind authorities from the People's Republic of China that the blood of Canadian soldiers was shed to defend Hong Kong and that we will not tolerate the violation of the rights of those citizens. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6169362" data-originallang="fr">That being said, let us come back to the text of the amendment to today's motion. I must say that, as in the case of the December motion that instituted the Special Committee on Canada-China Relations, this proposed amendment to the motion regarding the committee's interim report reeks of crass partisanship. In fact, the Conservatives are not even trying to hide the fact that their only objective is to make the Liberal government look bad.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6169363" data-originallang="fr">Their motion seems motivated by a preconceived idea. I would like to know what the Conservatives have to say about the objective that was very clearly announced by the Israeli government, that of annexing new Palestinian territories, namely, the colonies, the Jordan Valley and the area north of the Dead Sea.</p>
