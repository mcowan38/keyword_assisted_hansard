<p data-HoCid="8760268" data-originallang="en"> It's actually not me who's shaking my head, Mr. Chair, it's the family members with loved ones. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8760269" data-originallang="en">I'm aware of a Canadian family member whose spouse and child are being left behind. They cannot get a visa to get to safety. They're being asked to leave their spouse and child behind. That is the reality. That's what people are reacting to. I'm pretty sure MP Zahid would have heard about these cases and is equally concerned with the situation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8760270" data-originallang="en">In the immigration levels plan of the government, Minister, you're reducing the refugee numbers by 20% in 2025. We have not only the Lebanese Canadian community who cannot get to safety—there are no special immigration measures for them—but Sudanese communities' applications are also severely delayed. So far there's been a complete failure with Gaza. Hongkongers are going to be faced with eight years of waiting in trying to get their permanent residence. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8760271" data-originallang="en">I can go on. I have a giant pile of Afghan applications, and guess what? They've gone through all of their processing. Everything has been done. Do you know what? Their bring-forward date in the letter is July of 2025. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8760272" data-originallang="en">Minister, how do you explain that all these applications are faced with severe delays? </p>
