<p data-HoCid="6374118" data-originallang="en">This government has repeatedly stated that anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial have absolutely no place in our society. Earlier today, we announced that the Hon. Irwin Cotler would be our new special envoy on preserving Holocaust remembrance and combatting anti-Semitism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6374119" data-originallang="en"> The special envoy will lead Canada's delegation to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, advance Holocaust education, awareness and remembrance, all while taking meaningful action to combat anti-Semitism at home and abroad.</p>
