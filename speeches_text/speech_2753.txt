<p data-HoCid="7993365" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair. I appreciate that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7993366" data-originallang="en">First, the CBC leadership gave direction to their people to not call Hamas a terrorist organization, which is to side with the terrorists. Then the CBC started actually pumping out false information after saying that it was incumbent upon them to report only the facts.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7993367" data-originallang="en">They put out a story with the title, “Hundreds killed in Israeli airstrike on Gaza City hospital, Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza says”. Only moments later, they discovered that this was actually false information. Of course it is. Their intelligence came from Hamas. You have the CBC taking public dollars and using those dollars to broadcast a message from a terrorist organization. It's despicable.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7993368" data-originallang="en">The request to this committee is that we have the opportunity to speak to CBC's leadership and understand why they've been giving the direction that they've been giving, why they've been presenting the misleading and false information that they've been presenting.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7993369" data-originallang="en">They falsely claimed that the explosion was the result of Israel's purposely attacking the hospital. They falsely reported that it killed hundreds, and they falsely used B-roll to show dead bodies being removed from a hospital and the wounded being cared for. Only hours later, we discovered that the hospital actually wasn't hit; it was the parking lot. Hundreds weren't killed; wounded weren't removed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7993370" data-originallang="en">This is a public broadcaster taking over a billion dollars from Canadians in order to tell a false narrative on behalf of a terrorist organization.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7993371" data-originallang="en">Therefore, my request before this committee—</p>
