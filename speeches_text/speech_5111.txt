<p data-HoCid="8663377" data-originallang="fr">Thank you. That is very enlightening.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8663378" data-originallang="fr">When you appeared before our committee for the study of Canada's sanctions regime, you explained that the ultimate objective of the regime is to effect a change in the behaviour of the offending party, but also to constrict its ability to act financially and economically.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8663379" data-originallang="fr">I fear that Canada has a problem when it comes to credibility and consistency. It cited respect for the rule of law, the rules of international law and the sovereignty of states as a reason to stand up for Ukraine when Russia engaged in illegitimate, illegal and unjustified aggression against sovereign Ukrainian territory. However, it is less vocal about Israel's violation of the sovereignty of Lebanon, a member state of the United Nations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8663380" data-originallang="fr">Wouldn't it be appropriate to put sanctions in place to, as you put it, effect a change in the behaviour of the offending party and constrict its ability to act financially and economically?</p>
