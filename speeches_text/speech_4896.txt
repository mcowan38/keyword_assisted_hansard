<p data-HoCid="8576638" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the member for Thornhill can have her own version of the truth, but she cannot change the truth. Earlier tonight, she tweeted something that took a clip out of what the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> had said at a press conference and cut it off at only a few seconds. It was a shameful act of misinformation and disinformation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576639" data-originallang="en">The <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">minister</a> did call for de-escalation in the situation, as Canadians have all called for, but she also said immediately thereafter that we support Israel's right to protect itself against the attacks. Why did the member cut that part to try to foster division in this country, when we are supposed to heal this country?</p>
