<p data-HoCid="8003540" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, I'll be moving a motion for consideration at this committee. I would like it to be considered immediately, given that we are currently in committee business. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8003541" data-originallang="en">The motion reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8003542" data-originallang="en"> This committee condemns the CBC for publishing a false headline based on disinformation from Hamas, a criminal terrorist organization, that incorrectly stated Israel was responsible for the explosion at al-Alhi hospital in Gaza that resulted in the deaths of innocent civilians, and given that, </p>
<p data-HoCid="8003543" data-originallang="en"> The Prime Minister, the Minister of National Defence, the Canadian Forces Intelligence Command, the United States, the United Kingdom and France have all concluded this claim is false, </p>
<p data-HoCid="8003544" data-originallang="en"> The committee calls on the CBC to apologize to the Jewish community and all Canadians for spreading this dangerous disinformation and to publicly correct the record and to report this finding to the House of Commons. </p>
