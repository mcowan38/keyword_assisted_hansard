<p data-HoCid="8093355" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8093356" data-originallang="fr">Thanks to everyone who has come here today to tell us about this extremely important issue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8093357" data-originallang="fr">I'll go first to the representatives of Save the Children Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8093358" data-originallang="fr">We're all aware of the dramatic events that have been unfolding for several weeks in Gaza, which is now living under indiscriminate bombardment. I'd like to hear what the people from Save the Children Canada think about this because they discussed it in their opening remarks.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8093359" data-originallang="fr">What do you think are the consequences of this conflict and these bombardments in Gaza for children with disabilities? What impact will this have on their future?</p>
