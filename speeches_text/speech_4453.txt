<p data-HoCid="8455918" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, I want to thank the member for his question. I can answer it in a couple of ways.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455919" data-originallang="en"> First of all, our code of student conduct indeed notes that vexatious conduct directed at one or more specific individuals is potentially evidence of discriminatory conduct or harassment. It names race, ancestry, ethnic origin, colour, religion and these kinds of traits, which are straight out of the Ontario Human Rights Code. It takes that approach, rather than naming individual faiths, religions or cultures, so it's meant to be all inclusive.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455920" data-originallang="en"> Another way of answering the member's question would be to note that directly as a result of the work of our anti-Semitism working group, we have reviewed and overhauled our EDI process to make sure that our equity policies explicitly recognize anti-Semitism as a form of discrimination, harassment or hate. We have trained all of our equity officers expressly to address these issues.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455921" data-originallang="en">I could say more, but I think that directly answers the member's question.</p>
