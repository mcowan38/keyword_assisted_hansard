<p data-HoCid="8576455" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I have seen no credible reports of the State of Israel's violating either international humanitarian law or customary international law. The number of civilians who have been, unfortunately, killed in this conflict is not an arbitrary determinant as to whether a state is complying with international law.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576456" data-originallang="en"> I remind this House that the Allies during the Second World War killed 400,000 German civilians and that was not a war crime. Those were incidental to the targeting of military objectives. I remind this House that the Luftwaffe killed 40,000 Londoners during the Second World War and every one of those deaths was a war crime because the Luftwaffe deliberately targeted civilian areas of East London and not military objectives. The number of civilian deaths, however unfortunate, is not the determinant as to whether international humanitarian law has been breached.</p>
