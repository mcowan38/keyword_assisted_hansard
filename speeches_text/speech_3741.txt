<p data-HoCid="8300176" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300177" data-originallang="en">At the appropriate time, Mr. Chair, I intend to move a motion to have the minister come back to make up for the lost time. The other times the minister is scheduled to appear before committee are on other issues. This is on Gaza and the many family members who want accountability, transparency and answers from the government, and I think they deserve that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8300178" data-originallang="en">This motion specifically calls for the minister to appear before the committee for the full two hours and, because of votes—it's not the minister's fault—we have lost that time, and we need to make up that time. At the appropriate time, Mr. Chair, I will be moving a motion to that effect.</p>
