<p data-HoCid="8074587" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, the second point of order is a little more detailed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8074588" data-originallang="en">I rise to respond to a point of order raised on Tuesday, November 28, by the member for <a data-HoCid="278258" href="/politicians/andrew-scheer/" title="Andrew Scheer">Regina—Qu'Appelle</a> respecting the inadmissibility of the notice of Ways and Means Motion No. 19 and two items of Private Members' Business.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8074589" data-originallang="en">The crux of the argument by the member opposite is on the principle of a bill at second reading stage. This is the heart of the argument. I would humbly point to the purpose of the second reading debate and the vote at that stage, which is on the principle of the bill.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8074590" data-originallang="en">Before I get into the specific matters involved in the member's argument, I would like to remind my colleagues across the aisle of what a debate and vote on the principle of a bill entails.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8074591" data-originallang="en">Members of the House know that our Standing Orders and practices derive from those of Westminster. If a member would like to look into how debates at Westminster are handled at the second reading stage, they might be surprised. The British House of Commons has 650 members, yet the debate on any government bill at the second reading stage very rarely exceeds one sitting day.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8074592" data-originallang="en">Now I will go to the specific argument raised by my colleague across the way. The two bills in question that are subject to certain provisions containing Ways and Means Motion No. 19 are Bill <a data-HoCid="12260777" href="/bills/44-1/C-318/" title="An Act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and the Canada Labour Code (adoptive and intended parents)">C-318</a>, an act to amend the Employment Insurance Act, and Bill <a data-HoCid="12260850" href="/bills/44-1/C-323/" title="An Act to amend the Excise Tax Act (mental health services)">C-323</a>, an act to amend the Excise Tax Act (mental health services).</p>
<p data-HoCid="8074593" data-originallang="en">With respect to the first item, Bill <a data-HoCid="12260777" href="/bills/44-1/C-318/" title="An Act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and the Canada Labour Code (adoptive and intended parents)">C-318</a> requires a royal recommendation which would govern the entire scheme of a new employment insurance benefit for adoptive parents. As a result, the bill cannot come to a vote at third reading in the absence of a royal recommendation provided by a minister of the Crown.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8074594" data-originallang="en">The bill was drafted by employees of the law clerk's office who would have notified the sponsor of this requirement. While I would not want to speculate on the intentions of the member who sponsored this bill, there is little doubt that the member knew this bill would not pass without royal recommendation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8074595" data-originallang="en">As a result of a ministerial mandate commitment to bring forward an employment insurance benefit for adoptive parents with an accompanying royal recommendation, the government has brought forward this measure for consideration of the House in a manner that raises no procedural obstacle to providing this important benefit for Canadians. It is the sole prerogative of the executive to authorize new and distinct spending from the consolidated revenue fund, and that is what is proposed in the bill that would implement the measures contained in Ways and Means Motion No. 19.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8074596" data-originallang="en">Now I will go to the point of a similar question. The example my colleague raised with respect to the Speaker's ruling on February 18, 2021, concerns Bill <a data-HoCid="10983057" href="/bills/43-2/C-13/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (single event sport betting)">C-13</a> and Bill <a data-HoCid="10866122" href="/bills/43-2/C-218/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (sports betting)">C-218</a> respecting single sports betting. Both bills contain the same principle, that being to allow certain forms of single sports betting. The approaches contained in Bill <a data-HoCid="10983057" href="/bills/43-2/C-13/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (single event sport betting)">C-13</a> and Bill <a data-HoCid="10866122" href="/bills/43-2/C-218/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (sports betting)">C-218</a> were slightly different, but achieved the same purpose. As a result, and rightly so, the Speaker ruled that the bills were substantially similar and ruled that Bill <a data-HoCid="10983057" href="/bills/43-2/C-13/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (single event sport betting)">C-13</a> not be proceeded with.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8074597" data-originallang="en">The situation with Bill <a data-HoCid="10983057" href="/bills/43-2/C-13/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (single event sport betting)">C-13</a> and Bill <a data-HoCid="10866122" href="/bills/43-2/C-218/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (sports betting)">C-218</a> bears no resemblance to the situation currently before the House, and the member opposite has been again helpful in making my argument. The member cites the situation with Bill <a data-HoCid="11719486" href="/bills/44-1/C-19/" title="An Act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on April 7, 2022 and other measures">C-19</a> and Bill <a data-HoCid="11535416" href="/bills/44-1/C-250/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (prohibition — promotion of antisemitism)">C-250</a> concerning Holocaust denial.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8074598" data-originallang="en">The case with this situation, and the case currently before the House, is instructional for the question faced by the Speaker, which is whether the principle of the questions on the second reading of Bill <a data-HoCid="12260777" href="/bills/44-1/C-318/" title="An Act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and the Canada Labour Code (adoptive and intended parents)">C-318</a> and Bill <a data-HoCid="12260850" href="/bills/44-1/C-323/" title="An Act to amend the Excise Tax Act (mental health services)">C-323</a>, and the question on Ways and Means Motion No. 19, are the same.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8074599" data-originallang="en">The answer is categorically no. The question on both Ways and Means Motion No. 19 and the question should Ways and Means Motion No. 19 be adopted on the implementing of a bill are vastly different. The questions at second reading on Bill <a data-HoCid="12260777" href="/bills/44-1/C-318/" title="An Act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and the Canada Labour Code (adoptive and intended parents)">C-318</a> and Bill <a data-HoCid="12260850" href="/bills/44-1/C-323/" title="An Act to amend the Excise Tax Act (mental health services)">C-323</a> are specific questions on the principle of measures contained in those private members' bills.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8074600" data-originallang="en">The question on Ways and Means Motion No. 19 and the question at second reading on the bill to implement those measures is much broader. As the member stated in his intervention yesterday, Ways and Means Motion No. 19 contains many measures announced in the 2023 budget as well as in the fall economic statement. While the measures to implement the fall economic statement are thematically linked to the issue of affordability, they contain many measures to address the affordability challenges facing Canadians. As a result, the question at second reading on implementing legislation is a very different question for the House to consider.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8074601" data-originallang="en">In conclusion, while there have been precedents respecting similar questions on similar bills which propose a scheme for a specific issue, namely Bill <a data-HoCid="11603137" href="/bills/44-1/C-13/" title="An Act to amend the Official Languages Act, to enact the Use of French in Federally Regulated Private Businesses Act and to make related amendments to other Acts">C-13</a> and Bill <a data-HoCid="11472482" href="/bills/44-1/C-218/" title="An Act to amend the Excise Tax Act (psychotherapy services)">C-218</a>, this and other precedents do not in any way suggest that the questions at second reading on Bill <a data-HoCid="12260850" href="/bills/44-1/C-323/" title="An Act to amend the Excise Tax Act (mental health services)">C-323</a> and Bill <a data-HoCid="12260777" href="/bills/44-1/C-318/" title="An Act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and the Canada Labour Code (adoptive and intended parents)">C-318</a> in any way resemble the question on Ways and Means Motion No. 19 and the question at second reading on the implementing bill for the measures contained in the 2023 budget and the fall economic statement. </p>
