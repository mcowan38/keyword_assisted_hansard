<p data-HoCid="8232227" data-originallang="en">There's no question that there exists in the west—and by “the west”, I mean western countries broadly—a strain of conservatism that is pro-Putin and pro-Russia. It puts support for Ukraine in question, and it supports and disseminates conspiracy theories about Ukraine. It repeats propaganda statements made by, among others, the President of Russia. I would submit that Mr. Carlson is certainly in that category. In fact, he has expressed direct support for Russia in this conflict, which is quite incredible. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8232228" data-originallang="en">This also exists in Canada. What we have to do is stand up every day for the people of Ukraine and for our support of Ukraine to dissipate all of these conspiracy theories and plots that are described to us sometimes on the Internet and that sometimes lead us down some very dark, deep, rabbit holes. We'll continue to be doing that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8232229" data-originallang="en">One thing that will not stop is the government of Canada's support, and I hope the support of your party and that of the Bloc Québécois. By that I mean Canada's uniform support, economic support, diplomatic support and military support for the people and the armed forces of Ukraine.</p>
