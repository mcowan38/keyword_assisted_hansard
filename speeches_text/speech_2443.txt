<p data-HoCid="7836263" data-originallang="en"> That's why I wanted to clarify that. I know, for example, that you're passionate about sports, especially soccer. I know you're passionate about religious minority communities in Canada. You have often talked to me about anti-Semitism and other communities, the protection of churches and the protection of all of the things that have been raised today. I know you are passionate about them, and I don't want people to think that just because you're not responsible for them, you don't care about these things. I know you care deeply about them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7836264" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, I think my time is up. I just wanted to leave it at that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7836265" data-originallang="en"> Thank you.</p>
