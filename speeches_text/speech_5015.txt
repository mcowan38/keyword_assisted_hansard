<p data-HoCid="8583989" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I think every member of the House has raised concerns about civilians in Lebanon, as we have about civilians in Israel, in Gaza and in the West Bank. We will continue to advocate for peace. The violence and destruction in Lebanon has to end.</p>
