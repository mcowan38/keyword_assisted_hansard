<p data-HoCid="8428445" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, we are deeply concerned about the violence in Gaza and the devastating actions of the Israeli army in Rafah.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8428446" data-originallang="fr">We continue to call for an immediate ceasefire, as we have been doing since December. We are calling for much more humanitarian aid to be delivered to the people of Gaza. We continue to work with our partners, allies and friends in the region to establish a process towards a two-state solution, with a secure and recognized Palestinian state.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8428447" data-originallang="fr">Yes, we are working towards that.</p>
