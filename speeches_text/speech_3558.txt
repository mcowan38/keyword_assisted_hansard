<p data-HoCid="8267926" data-originallang="en">Through the chair, thank you MP Gazan for that very important question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8267927" data-originallang="en">I've been very excited today to hear the consistency across our testimony when it comes to the care economy and the importance of reversing the devaluation of that work. It is devalued for the very reason that it has traditionally been held by women, and there are ongoing stereotypes about the reason why people do this work. I have been told by government representatives that part of the compensation is the goodwill I get from the work I do, but I think we would all agree that goodwill doesn't put dinner on the tableâ€”certainly not in today's economy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8267928" data-originallang="en">We need to rethink how we're viewing this work and understand that the work the care economy does is critical. It underpins the rest of the Canadian economy, allowing others to work and contribute.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8267929" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
