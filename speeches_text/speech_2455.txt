<p data-HoCid="7861271" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, as I said, this bill would not infringe on anything involving the indigenous rights under section 35. I discussed this with my colleagues here in this place: the member for <a data-HoCid="278704" href="/politicians/lori-idlout/" title="Lori Idlout">Nunavut</a> and the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>, who are well versed in these matters.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7861272" data-originallang="en"> Again, this is the fifth time this bill has been tabled in this place. Those matters have been discussed in committee and discussed at length in other venues, so I am confident we are actually making this country a clean and healthy place for all. Indigenous people are really the best stewards we have had, and I am sure they would appreciate any legislation that would keep us all protected from anything that would limit the ability for us to live in a healthy environment.</p>
