<p data-HoCid="8823391" data-originallang="en">We condemn, on this side, unequivocally, any form of hate or anti-Semitism in this country. We have actually put forward Canada's first-ever action plan on combatting hate, with $274 million supporting communities on the ground. We have put forward $25 million for a new Montreal Holocaust museum, which the Conservatives voted against, and $5 million for the first-ever national Holocaust remembrance program, which the Conservatives voted against. </p>
