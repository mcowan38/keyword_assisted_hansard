<p data-HoCid="8300443" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300444" data-originallang="fr">I want to welcome the three witnesses, and thank them for their generosity. They always agree to come back before the committee to enlighten us on certain issues.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300445" data-originallang="fr">Ms. MacIntyre, many Canadians and people in the riding I represent, in particular, are concerned about the safety of their family members and loved ones in Gaza. Under these measures, the number of applications that can be accepted has been capped at 1,000, which has caused a great deal of concern.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300446" data-originallang="fr">Could you explain the objective of this cap to the committee?</p>
