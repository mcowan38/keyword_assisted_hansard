<p data-HoCid="6028542" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak about this issue from the member for <a data-HoCid="252804" href="/politicians/garnett-genuis/" title="Garnett Genuis">Sherwood Parkâ€”Fort Saskatchewan</a>. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6028543" data-originallang="en">I would like to remind my hon. colleague that Canada has already put in place a series of strong measures to hold Iran accountable for its support of terrorism. To start, we continue to list the IRGC's Quds Force as a terrorist entity under the Criminal Code. The Quds Force is Iran's primary mechanism for cultivating and supporting terrorist groups abroad. Its actions have destabilized countries across the Middle East and wreaked havoc throughout the region. Our government is also continuing to list a number of terrorist entities that have benefited from the force's patronage, including arms, funding and paramilitary training, and that help advance Iran's interests and foreign policy. These include Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the Taliban.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6028544" data-originallang="en">In Canada, recommendations can be made to the Governor in Council for individuals or groups to be officially designated as terrorist entities, and last June our government added three new Iran-backed groups to the Criminal Code list. These three groups are aligned with Iran and their actions further Iranian interests. Iran provides them with substantial resources, including training and weapons to carry out terrorist acts that advance its goals in the region.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6028545" data-originallang="en">Canada has also imposed restrictive measures against entities and individuals within the IRGC that have a similar effect to a listing. The IRGC and its leadership continue to be sanctioned under the Special Economics Measures Act in response to Iran's nuclear and ballistic missiles program. This allows assets of individuals and entities associated with the group to be frozen. Regulations explicitly target the IRGC and several sub-organizations, including the IRGC air force and air force missile command, IRGC logistics and procurement, IRGC missile command, and the IRGC navy and several members of its senior leadership. Iran also continues to be designated as a state supporter of terrorism under Canada's State Immunity Act. Through our engagements in the Financial Action Task Force, Canada also contributes to international efforts to hold Iran accountable for its financing of terrorism. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6028546" data-originallang="en">The Government of Canada will continue to hold Iran accountable for its actions and support for terrorism. We remain committed to ensuring the safety and security of Canadians and Canadian interests against any and all threats.</p>
