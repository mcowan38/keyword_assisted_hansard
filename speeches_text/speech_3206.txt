<p data-HoCid="8124762" data-originallang="en">I have four things I'd like to raise.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8124763" data-originallang="en">The first thing is thanking officials at Global Affairs Canada headquarters and the people in the emergency watch and response centre who've had to step up. That's extremely important. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8124764" data-originallang="en">Also, I thank the people who have been brought in at missions in Ramallah, Tel Aviv, Cairo and perhaps elsewhere, such as Amman.
