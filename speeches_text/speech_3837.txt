<p data-HoCid="8303248" data-originallang="en">This part is not only on politicians. This part is not only on members of Parliament. It is the duty of Canadians, be they of Ukrainian descent or Polish descent or Jewish descent, to work together. We cannot relitigate the past. We obviously have deep differences of opinion here around this table. That said, there is already work being done between the Polish community, the Ukrainian community and the Jewish community. This work has to be encouraged by members of Parliament, but it has to be <em>sui generis</em>. It has to be from the communities themselves. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8303249" data-originallang="en">I would put it to you, Mr. Kmiec, that this is work that the respective communities want to do.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303250" data-originallang="en">Now, in terms of repairing the damage that has been done, it's ensuring that something like this does not happen again. That part is actually on this institution, on members of Parliament and on the administration of this place.</p>
