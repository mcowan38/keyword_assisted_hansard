<p data-HoCid="7988244" data-originallang="fr">Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988245" data-originallang="fr">People in my riding are very worried and feel powerless. As a mother, I'm also very concerned about the circumstances of children affected by this horrible conflict. The children and families of people in Gaza are almost out of food, water, electricity and medical supplies. Israeli children are being held hostage and must be returned to their families.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988246" data-originallang="fr">Canadians agree on one thing: and that is that it's absolutely essential to provide humanitarian aid. It's true that Canada has committed $60 million for humanitarian aid, but based on what we can see on TV, aid is only trickling in.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988247" data-originallang="fr">Can you explain to Canadians what is preventing humanitarian aid from reaching those who need it most? They don't understand the difference, technically speaking, between a ceasefire and a cessation of hostilities. The process of providing humanitarian aid has to be safe for humanitarian workers, and the lives of civilians need to be protected.</p>
