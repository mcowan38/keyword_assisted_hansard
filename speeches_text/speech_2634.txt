It was a terrorist attack that must be condemned in the strongest possible terms. We also agree that Hamas must be eradicated from the Gaza Strip. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7957643" data-originallang="fr">The Gaza Strip is now blockaded and, under international law, humanitarian corridors must be put in place. Currently, this is not the case.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957644" data-originallang="fr">In my colleague's opinion, what is currently preventing Israel from setting up humanitarian corridors?</p>
