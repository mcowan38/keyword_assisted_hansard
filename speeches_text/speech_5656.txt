<p data-HoCid="8718659" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present a petition from members of the Lebanese Canadian community in my riding of Scarborough Centre. They draw the attention of the House to the expansion of the conflict in the Middle East, which has killed tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians, into Lebanon, where Israeli military action has killed hundreds of people and injured and displaced thousands since September 23 alone. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8718660" data-originallang="en">Petitioners note what they consider endless visa restrictions for people trying to flee the war zone. They call on the government to implement a special visa program similar to what Canada provided for Ukrainians fleeing their war zone; temporary resident visas for the extended family of Canadian citizens and permanent residents who want to reach Canada; the safe evacuation of Canadian citizens and their extended families from Lebanon; and a transparent and fair process that gives priority to evacuating women, children and the elderly.</p>
