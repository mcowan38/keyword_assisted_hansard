<p data-HoCid="7553493" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7553494" data-originallang="fr">I'd like to thank all the witnesses for their testimony.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7553495" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Keating, after the hearing, which lasted a month, the tribunal ruled in favour of Shaw, Rogers and Videotron. That was December 31. Expert testimony was cited extensively, particularly that of Mark Israel from Compass Lexecon.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7553496" data-originallang="fr">The tribunal found Mr. Israel open, candid and knowledgeable, and that he did expose a number of significant flaws in the opposing experts' analysis. Where Mr. Israel and the opposing expert disagreed, the tribunal noted that Compass Lexecon was the expert who provided the strongest and most convincing testimony. The tribunal concluded that Mr. Israel had convincingly demonstrated that the opposing expert's model would not have predicted a significant price increase and agreed with Mr. Israel that the opposing expert's predicted price increase in the wake of the merger was highly questionable.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7553497" data-originallang="fr">We just heard from representatives of the Competition Bureau. However, when they testified, they had not studied the new deal between Shaw, Rogers and Quebecor. They insisted on looking only at the agreement between Rogers and Shaw. The tribunal determined that the Commissioner of Competition had not fulfilled his responsibility to determine certain impacts the agreement would have.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7553498" data-originallang="fr">Could you give us examples of how the Commissioner of Competition has failed to fulfill his responsibilities in recent months?</p>
