<p data-HoCid="7966268" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, imagine someone having lunch in a Jewish-owned business in downtown Toronto, only to be shouted at because they are Jewish. Imagine someone being harassed outside their children's school, where they have been told they would be safe, as they are escorted in by uniformed police officers. Imagine someone being told they should not come to the office on a Monday morning, or maybe that it would be wise to take the religious identifier that was meant to signify their faith off their front door because it would make them a target.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7966269" data-originallang="en">We do not have to imagine it. It is all happening here, and it is being further fuelled by the irresponsible statements pushed by the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, who, six days after repeating Hamas's talking points, still has not corrected the record.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7966270" data-originallang="en">Imagine someone being terrified in their own community and having a <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> who has not said a word about it. It is quite the opposite: He took the word of a terrorist organization over the words of his own military and our allies and still has not retracted his statement.</p>
