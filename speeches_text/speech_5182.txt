<p data-HoCid="8679510" data-originallang="en">I will get in one last question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679511" data-originallang="en"> You also said at this committee that recognizing Palestinian statehood is “the least that Canada can do”, and you've spoken quite a bit about what's necessary with respect to the occupied Palestinian territories. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679512" data-originallang="en">Can you share more? We're talking about Palestinian statehood and a lasting peace. What are the implications if we want a lasting peace, as it relates to the occupied Palestinian territories? </p>
