<p data-HoCid="6703660" data-originallang="en">I think the idea that Veterans Affairs has developed going forward is to focus on geographical parts of the world over a five-year cycle and then, within that five-year cycle, not repeating the focus each time. If it is a Middle East focus, for example, it may be UNEF 1 on the first go-round that will have the focus, although the whole commitment will be covered, but then the next time it'll be Iraq. The next time, it could be the Jordan-Israeli border.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6703661" data-originallang="en">I think that notion of going around the world geographically on a repetitive cycle but changing the specific focus each time is going to bring out the large number of deployments that there have been.</p>
