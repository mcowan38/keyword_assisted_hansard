<p data-HoCid="7702191" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, thank you for presiding again today. They should give you an honorary badge, half a robe or something because you are doing a good job, as usual.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7702192" data-originallang="en">I appreciate the opportunity to intervene on Bill <a data-HoCid="11876139" href="/bills/44-1/C-288/" title="An Act to amend the Telecommunications Act (transparent and accurate broadband services information)">C-288</a>. I want to start with a bit about process before I get into the content. I think it is important for those who are watching today to understand more about how this place works.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7702193" data-originallang="en">I also want to congratulate the member for <a data-HoCid="278380" href="/politicians/dan-mazier/" title="Dan Mazier">Dauphin—Swan River—Neepawa</a>. We have limited chances in this place to make a real difference. The way it works for Private Members' Business is that our names are all put into a drum, so to speak. We can think of it like a ping pong ball being drawn. We each get a number assigned to us; this allows each of us to have the possibility of a private member's bill or motion presented here in the chamber. In a minority Parliament, it is very rare to get through a lot of these slots. It is difficult even with a majority government.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7702194" data-originallang="en">When we get the chance or opportunity, in many respects, it is like winning the lottery. What do members do after that? They decide what they want to do with their legislative agenda. They can bring a motion. The motion could pass, and it may be a really good motion on any number of subjects, but it may not change law. It changes the law only if the government decides to use it, because it is not binding in the House of Commons.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7702195" data-originallang="en">We can also bring through legislation. In the history of this place, it is very difficult to get private members' legislation passed. It does happen. I hope that this Parliament will actually set a record.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7702196" data-originallang="en">I think the member needs to be congratulated because he has brought forth a reasonable approach to an issue that is really important for all Canadians, as well as for consumers. I think it is important for the House to show that at the end of the day, we can actually use Private Members' Business for good.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7702197" data-originallang="en">It can be any government; I do not care whether it is red or blue over there. Eventually we want it to be orange, but that is for another day. Nobody over there just owns all the best ideas. This place needs more of them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7702198" data-originallang="en">I congratulate the member because he has a specific thing here to fix broadband services and bring greater accountability to their advertising and what they are promoting, which is critical in a couple of contexts. One is obviously truth in advertising. This bill would give more expectations and oversight to ensure that when services are advertising certain speeds, consumers actually get that. That is important for making purchasing decisions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7702199" data-originallang="en">However, this is not just about how fast someone can download entertainment, whether it is a Disney movie, a cat video, a squirrel waterskiing on YouTube or whatever. The reality is that when people make these decisions, whether they are businesses or individuals, speed can matter. We have seen that come to fruition. I think that is something that gets lost in this bill. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7702200" data-originallang="en">The government once had immigration numbers, where someone's spot in line would be determined by getting online. I do not like that. If someone had a better speed at that time, their case was advanced over other people's cases. If we think about other businesses that require the proper speeds and services they pay for, it adds a consequence that is more than just the entertainment value that I talked about earlier.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7702201" data-originallang="en">I think that part really needs to be mentioned a couple of times. If someone owns a business or wants to spend extra money on this type of service, they should get it. If they do not get it, there are real consequences.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7702202" data-originallang="en">I am a PlayStation gamer, and I play Apex Legends with my friends. If my speed is interrupted, that has very few consequences. However, if it is a tool and die manufacturer or some other business that requires more real-time analysis and quicker responses, and their competitors have an edge over them, that has a consequence for their overall income.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7702203" data-originallang="en">I mentioned the immigration case where it actually had consequences for people's casework in becoming Canadian citizens in reality. They are not doing that anymore.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7702204" data-originallang="en">My point is that, on the surface, this bill might seem like a consumer-friendly approach to doing things that should be done anyways. However, at the end of the day, the consequences can be quite real.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7702205" data-originallang="en">I also want to commend the member for using previous work from the House of Commons. I was on the industry committee. I am going to read the title of something we studied in 2021. It was called “Affordability and Accessibility of Telecommunications Services in Canada: Encouraging Competition to (Finally) Bridge the Digital Divide”. We had a recommendation for truth in advertising related to speeds and services.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7702206" data-originallang="en">I think the member using that bipartisan work that was done in committee and taking a recommendation is a clever way, a smart way and also a good way, because we never saw any action on it. We did not see the government act and complete it. I am not saying that that the government is derelict or negligent on that, but unfortunately many committee studies do not see actual results because of the volume of work; because the issue is not “sexy” enough, in terms of grabbing attention; or because the government does not totally agree with it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7702207" data-originallang="en">The member went back, and on that committee we had the Bloc, the NDP, the Conservatives and the Liberals, and then the report was tabled here in the House where the Green Party could also look at it and also other independents. They do not participate in the committee structure formally, but informally they can, so it has gotten the eyes of all of this place here. Using that recommendation and pulling from it is actually, again, another reason to say “thanks”, because resources were spent in this place to do that study, resources like money and time, all the staffing support and the researchers who did the work in previous Parliaments. They do not want it buried and put on a shelf with other studies in this place.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7702208" data-originallang="en">It is actually getting life again, and the member for <a data-HoCid="278380" href="/politicians/dan-mazier/" title="Dan Mazier">Dauphin—Swan River—Neepawa</a> deserves credit for that, because that is all work that took place. We passed it the first time and it went to committee. I was at committee. The member showed up and gave testimony. We had other submissions, and it basically survived the test of mettle of another review, and that is why we are back here today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7702209" data-originallang="en">From what I understand, we are supporting it as New Democrats. I hope the bill is going to get unanimous support in this chamber and then move to the Senate. For people who are watching this time, it is a private member's bill, and it could actually have a real impact, if it goes before the summer to the Senate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7702210" data-originallang="en">Perhaps we could see the bill come out of the Senate and passed before we actually have the end of the session. That would be awesome, because it would then provide, again, some more accountability out there, and it would show that parliamentary work can get done. Despite question period, which is a time that is not the best environment to see things, there are times when we actually work quite well together and use Canadian resources to the best of our abilities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7702211" data-originallang="en"> I am going to finally wrap up by saying New Democrats are really pleased to see the bill go forward. I am hoping the member has it passed. I worked with the member for <a data-HoCid="278477" href="/politicians/kevin-waugh/" title="Kevin Waugh">Saskatoon—Grasswood</a> on his private member's bill on single-event sports betting that was passed and made law. I took my legislation off the table and gave the spot to him. He used his spot in a non-partisan way. We actually worked together on that issue, and I am hoping the member gets similar results here and that we can see the bill come into law before the end of the session.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7702212" data-originallang="en">I am going to wrap and say thanks again.</p>
