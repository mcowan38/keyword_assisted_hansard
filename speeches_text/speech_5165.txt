<p data-HoCid="8679426" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much for the question, sir. You've skipped a portion of it. The proposition that resolution 181 of November 29, 1947, is illegal does not equate to suggesting that in 2024 Israel does not have a right to exist. Let's be clear. Israel is a fact. It is a state. It has the right to territorial integrity and political independence as a state. It's a state—full stop. That's a fact. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679427" data-originallang="en">The question that I was looking at in that speech and as a scholar, which I have done in a book I would commend to you called <em>The United Nations and the Question of Palestine</em>—see chapter 4—is that actions taken in November 1947 by the UN General Assembly to partition Palestine did not comport with the requirements of international law as international law stood at that date. The principle of inter-temporal law requires that we apply the law as it exists at the time in question that you're looking at. Israel exists today. It is established.</p>
