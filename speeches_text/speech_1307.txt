<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for <a data-HoCid="253002" href="/politicians/leona-alleslev/" title="Leona Alleslev">Aurora—Oak Ridges—Richmond Hill</a>. As the strong, proud and ready member of Parliament for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, I am honoured to represent Garrison Petawawa.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Today's motion is about the legacy of the Canadian Armed Forces during the current <a data-HoCid="214311" href="/politicians/harjit-s-sajjan/" title="Harjit S. Sajjan">defence minister</a>'s tenure. He needs to step aside, since he is not prepared to admit each time he failed to uphold his oath of office to the Canadian people. He was under the direct supervision of the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>. There is no room in the Prime Minister's Office or the Department of National Defence for sexism, misogyny, racism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, discrimination, harassment or any other conduct that prevents the institution and the whole of government from being a truly welcoming and inclusive organization.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Canadians understand that a culture change, starting with the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, is required to remove his culture of toxic masculinity behaviour to create an environment where everyone is respected, valued and can feel safe to contribute to the best of their abilities. As the member of Parliament for Garrison Petawawa, I know that respect is precious. If the <a data-HoCid="214311" href="/politicians/harjit-s-sajjan/" title="Harjit S. Sajjan">Minister of National Defence</a> has any respect for the members of the Canadian Armed Forces, he would have resigned a long time ago.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">I have worked very hard to earn the respect of our women and men in uniform. They are heroes. This was in the 2018 briefing note to the chain of command, up to the <a data-HoCid="214311" href="/politicians/harjit-s-sajjan/" title="Harjit S. Sajjan">Minister of National Defence</a>, the individual at the top who claims ignorance of war crimes:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en"> We remain uncertain whether appropriate action was effectively taken...I am an ethical man and I believe in our moral doctrine and the LOAC (Law of Armed Conflict). I am bothered by the fact that my assigned duties allowed me to train and enable people who in my mind were criminals. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">These soldiers are also my constituents. I have a direct responsibility in calling out this dereliction of duty on the part of the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>. I acknowledge the trust they placed in me when they acted with a conscience. I will always have the backs of the women and men in uniform.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">On behalf of the people of Canada and on behalf of our Conservative government-in-waiting, I thank the soldiers who first raised the issue of war crimes, and then continue to raise these concerns. They have the gratitude and full support of the Conservatives, even if the Liberal Party continues to slough them off and act vindictively towards the soldiers who reported what they saw.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">It is obvious to those who care about things like international treaties and the law of armed conflict that the <a data-HoCid="214311" href="/politicians/harjit-s-sajjan/" title="Harjit S. Sajjan">Minister of National Defence</a> has many lessons to learn. He needs to take lessons from the official opposition when it comes to serving his country. The minister claims no politician should ever start investigations. How quickly he forgot his own advice when it came to an hon. naval officer, like Vice-Admiral Mark Norman. What the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> ordered, however, was not an investigation against Mark Norman, it was a witch hunt that ended badly for the Prime Minister and his minister. </p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">While I am proud and ready to defend the honour and reputations of the women and men who serve as the members of the Canadian Armed Forces, I cannot say the same about the current <a data-HoCid="214311" href="/politicians/harjit-s-sajjan/" title="Harjit S. Sajjan">Minister of National Defence</a>. The reputation has been maligned by the government of our country. The lack of leadership and direction from the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> has created many casualties.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">First is the <a data-HoCid="214311" href="/politicians/harjit-s-sajjan/" title="Harjit S. Sajjan">Minister of National Defence</a>. The motion put forward by the <a data-HoCid="263838" href="/politicians/erin-otoole/" title="Erin O'Toole">leader of my party</a> says it all. Seeing the Minister of National Defence reduced to repeating mindless talking points is sad, when he had a strong role model sitting next to him, the former minister of justice, the MP for <a data-HoCid="253061" href="/politicians/jody-wilson-raybould/" title="Jody Wilson-Raybould">Vancouver Granville</a>. As a principled woman, she knew when it was time to stand up and act honourably.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">The next casualties of the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>'s lack of leadership are the women in uniform who have been victims of sexual misconduct under his watch, and the double standard on the way women and men are treated by the so-called, let me grope for his self-label, “feminist Prime Minister”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Let us talk about the female officer who was charged, convicted, fined and removed from her post. Her treatment was in direct contrast to the treatment afforded to Lieutenant-General Christopher Coates who, while serving as deputy commander of NORAD, had a consensual relationship with a civilian woman serving with the U.S. military in Colorado Springs.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">He was allowed to continue his post before being transferred home last summer to take over the military's joint operations command. Coates was due to be transferred to the senior NATO post in Naples, Italy, until news of the affair became public. Now, ignoring the family relationship between Coates and DND deputy minister Jody Thomas, this example of the double standard women in uniform face every day from the government is appalling. We can add that to the casualty list on sexual misconduct.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">The <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>'s own chief of staff, Katie Telford, did nothing to rein in the problem of the Prime Minister's toxic masculinity and seriously address the problem of the sexual misconduct crisis in the military. That makes her part of the problem and she should have resigned her position when her complicity was exposed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">The next casualties of the lack of leadership and direction by the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> and his <a data-HoCid="214311" href="/politicians/harjit-s-sajjan/" title="Harjit S. Sajjan">Minister of National Defence</a> are all the serving women in the Canadian Armed Forces. From the highest-ranking general to those who are still around, to the newly enlisted, who should be eager to serve their country, but who are now demoralized by the actions of the Prime Minister.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">There are also fine individuals like Mark Norman and former armed forces ombudsman, Gary Walbourne. I am a member of the Standing Committee on National Defence. We invited Gary to come to our committee. He stated for the record he met the <a data-HoCid="214311" href="/politicians/harjit-s-sajjan/" title="Harjit S. Sajjan">defence minister</a> in 2018 to discuss an allegation of sexual misconduct against former chief of the defence staff, Jonathan Vance.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">When he offered to show the <a data-HoCid="214311" href="/politicians/harjit-s-sajjan/" title="Harjit S. Sajjan">minister</a> proof of the allegation, former armed forces ombudsman Walbourne stated the government pushed him away and refused to review the evidence. “The only thing I ever wanted the minister to do was his job,” he is quoted as saying at the time that this happened. He then observed that “doing nothing wasn't the response I was looking for”. Doing nothing is the legacy of the <a data-HoCid="214311" href="/politicians/harjit-s-sajjan/" title="Harjit S. Sajjan">defence minister</a> and the government. This is now a government-wide scandal.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">The next casualties in the DND scandal are the MP for <a data-HoCid="252970" href="/politicians/karen-mccrimmon/" title="Karen McCrimmon">Kanata—Carleton</a> and the MP for <a data-HoCid="252655" href="/politicians/anita-vandenbeld/" title="Anita Vandenbeld">Ottawa West—Nepean</a>. The endless filibustering of the Standing Committee on National Defence will not go unnoticed by voters. They also had a role model like the member who had also left the Liberal caucus who used to sit beside them in the government caucus. To retired general Andrew Leslie, the former member of Parliament for Orléans, who resigned rather than being reduced to a mindless government cheerleader, I thank him for his service to this country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">The last point I will now deal with is the myth that some elements of the bought media repeat is that the military fared okay while the member for <a data-HoCid="253008" href="/politicians/harjit-s-sajjan/" title="Harjit S. Sajjan">Vancouver South</a> has been sitting in the defence minister's chair. Under the <a data-HoCid="214311" href="/politicians/harjit-s-sajjan/" title="Harjit S. Sajjan">defence minister</a>'s time, though the government may have committed spending more money on the military in real dollars, it is all promised spending. The devil is always in the details. My constituents clearly remember the decade of darkness when Liberals slashed budgets, starting with disbanding the Canadian Airborne Regiment.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">For spending to actually happen, soldiers have to rely on a future elected Conservative government. Of the purchases that have actually been delivered so far, they are mired in controversy. Who is Adam Coates again? By all tests, the <a data-HoCid="214311" href="/politicians/harjit-s-sajjan/" title="Harjit S. Sajjan">Minister of National Defence</a> has failed Canadians.</p>
