<p data-HoCid="8359808" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, our position when it comes to arms export permits is well known and absolutely clear.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8359809" data-originallang="en">When it comes to what is happening in the Middle East, we have been clear: The violence must stop. We need a ceasefire now. Hostages must be released, and we need to make sure that humanitarian aid gets into Gaza. At the end of the day, what we need is a two-state solution where the State of Israel can live side by side in peace and security with a Palestinian state.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8359810" data-originallang="en"> I have been in contact with my U.S., U.K. and many Arab countries counterparts over the weekend, working hard on bringing back peace to the Middle East.</p>
