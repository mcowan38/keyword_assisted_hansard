<p data-HoCid="8679269" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679270" data-originallang="en">I want to thank all three witnesses. I go to a lot of committee meetings, and it is rare that I listen to every word that every witness says. I felt it was emotional for me to listen to your testimony and also helpful, so to all of you, thank you for your preparation, for your care and for the work you do.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679271" data-originallang="en"> I think we're agreed in this Parliament and on this committee to a two-state solution. That has been something that successive governments have said. To do that, we need two states. The question is not if there should be two states—with the recognition of Palestine—but when. We also value a negotiated settlement. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679272" data-originallang="en">I'm looking at what you believe are the carrots and the sticks that we can provide for the two parties to have a negotiated settlement going forward. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679273" data-originallang="en">Finally, if we can't get a negotiated settlement, what other options under international law or the UN are there? </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679274" data-originallang="en">The question is about carrots and sticks to build a negotiated settlement for Israel and for the Palestinians, and what Canada's role could be in that, Professor Kersten.</p>
