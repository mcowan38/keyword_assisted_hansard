<p data-HoCid="7927941" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for his question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7927942" data-originallang="fr">As I mentioned, it was a very painful incident for everyone in the House and, of course, for all Canadians, especially those who have family members who were affected by the Holocaust, namely, the Jewish and Eastern European communities. This really hurts. Personally, I was disappointed by what happened.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7927943" data-originallang="fr">I would like to ask everyone to deal with this responsibly.</p>
