<p data-HoCid="7427620" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7427621" data-originallang="en">I thank all the witnesses for being here today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7427622" data-originallang="en">Before I get to my questions, I would like to move a motion that I have on notice. I will go through this quickly so that we can get back to our important witnesses right away. I move: </p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7427623" data-originallang="en"> That, pursuant to Standing Order 108(2), the committee invite the Minister of Housing and Diversity and Inclusion and relevant officials to appear before the committee for no less than two hours regarding the federal funding provided to the Community Media Advocacy Centre by the Government of Canada and the officials’ handling of the situation; that the meeting be televised; and that the meeting take place no later than November 10, 2022. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7427624" data-originallang="en">I'll make just a couple of points. To clarify, this would be during our constituency week next week. We have no meetings scheduled then, so it would not take away from any of the work that this committee is doing. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7427625" data-originallang="en">I'll note as well that during the heritage committee meeting on October 21, in testimony regarding the grant given to the CMAC, <a data-HoCid="278929" href="/politicians/pablo-rodriguez/" title="Pablo Rodriguez">Minister Rodriguez</a> said, “Minister Hussen is totally responsible for this program.” </p>
<p data-HoCid="7427626" data-originallang="en">We have new information that we need answers to. We need to hear from <a data-HoCid="278914" href="/politicians/ahmed-hussen/" title="Ahmed Hussen">Minister Hussen</a> quickly, given Laith Marouf's anti-Semitism and anti-French views.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7427627" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair. </p>
