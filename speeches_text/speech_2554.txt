<p data-HoCid="7956566" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, innocent lives, be they Palestinian, Israeli, Jewish, Muslim, Christian or otherwise, are all equally precious. Countless innocent lives have been lost or put in danger as a direct result of the sadistic attacks of Hamas. That was the purpose of those attacks: to exact maximum damage on both Israelis and Palestinians and to thwart any attempt for peace. We know that the regime in Iran was behind these attacks, and we know that the most powerful organizer of terrorism in the world is the IRGC, which operates legally in Canada today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7956567" data-originallang="en">Will the government accept the common-sense Conservative bill to criminalize the IRGC in Canada?</p>
