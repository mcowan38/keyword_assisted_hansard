<p data-HoCid="8178126" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I am rising on a question of privilege about a very serious matter: the misleading comments of the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> concerning the invitation of Yaroslav Hunka, a former soldier of the Waffen-SS military unit in World War II, to attend events with the President of Ukraine during his recent visit to Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8178127" data-originallang="en">As we all recall, last September this chamber was the epicentre of a grave international embarrassment for Canada when this individual, a former SS soldier, was recognized and given a standing ovation during President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's address to our Parliament. This gave Vladimir Putin a major propaganda coup and caused significant pain for Jewish Canadians and all victims persecuted in World War II.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8178128" data-originallang="en">The government, and the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> in particular, were at great pains to distance themselves from any connection to this individual, claiming that they had absolutely nothing to do with his invitation and subsequent recognition. Lo and behold, Global Affairs Canada recently released, through access to information, a copy of an email sent to Yaroslav Hunka inviting him to a reception with President Zelenskyy, which was reported on yesterday afternoon by The Globe and Mail and, subsequently, other media outlets.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8178129" data-originallang="en">Here is the kicker: It was the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>'s invitation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8178130" data-originallang="en">On Monday, September 19, 2023, some four days before the President's address to Parliament, an email account called "RSVP Official Events/Événements officiels RSVP" sent an email with the subject line, “INVITATION FROM THE PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA — SEPTEMBER 22, 2023”. The body of the email begins, “Dear Yaroslav Hunka, The Right Honourable...Prime Minister of Canada, is pleased to invite you to a special event.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8178131" data-originallang="en">As members may recall, until the visit was formally announced a few days later, there was a lot of coded language being used, like in the case of this "special event", but the point remains, that the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> invited this former SS soldier to attend an event honouring the President of Ukraine. Of course, members will recall that the Prime Minister and his government were under sustained questioning in the House in the week following the visit about just how such a colossal mistake, with international reverberations, could take place.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8178132" data-originallang="en">There were questions like those asked by the <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">Leader of the Opposition</a> on the first occasion the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> appeared in the House after the scandalous events, such as, “did the Prime Minister's national security, intelligence or diplomatic officials vet the names of the people the Prime Minister allowed within mere feet of President Zelenskyy?”; and “the Prime Minister has just said that he allowed the president of a war-torn country, who is perhaps the biggest target of false propaganda and potential assassinations, to be surrounded by hundreds of people who had not been vetted for their security background, the potential risks they present or, in this case, the massive diplomatic disasters they could have brought to the event. Is the Prime Minister really saying he did absolutely nothing to protect the Ukrainian president from all those many risks?”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8178133" data-originallang="en">Repeatedly, we were assured that the blame lay exclusively at the then-Speaker's feet, as if the address to Parliament was the only opportunity for this former SS soldier to come near President Zelenskyy. For example, the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> told the House on September 27, 2023, “The Leader of the Opposition knows that not one parliamentarian was aware”, and, later, “no parliamentarian knew the name or the identity of the person he welcomed to this House and recognized”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8178134" data-originallang="en">Now we know, that this is just not so. The <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> invited this individual, by name, to an event with President Zelenskyy. The Prime Minister also said that day, “the Speaker of this House of Commons invited an individual without apparently doing that Google search, but it is not up to the government of the day to oversee or to have a veto power over those who the Speaker or, indeed, members of official parties choose to invite into this House.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8178135" data-originallang="en">Who does the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> blame for not doing “that Google search” for his own personal invitation?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8178136" data-originallang="en">Before the Liberals jump up and claim that these are two separate events, two separate guest lists and whatnot, let me quote an interview the former Speaker, the honourable member for <a data-HoCid="278667" href="/politicians/anthony-rota/" title="Anthony Rota">Nipissing—Timiskaming</a>, gave to CTV Northern Ontario two weeks ago, explaining the central role the Prime Minister's Office plays in guest invitations for major international events held on Parliament Hill, like President Zelenskyy's wartime address, stating, “normally it goes to the Prime Minister's Office and they go through it with a fine-tooth comb” and then the invitation goes out from protocol. “So who invited him? That's up for grabs....”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8178137" data-originallang="en">Besides the fact that there was no sign of a comb, fine-tooth or otherwise, to be found, yesterday afternoon's revelations add new context to the last words in that quotation: "who invited him? That's up for grabs".</p>
<p data-HoCid="8178138" data-originallang="en">According to news reports at the time, it is understood that this individual's son approached the then Speaker's constituency office about securing an invitation to the Ottawa address. Knowing on the Monday of the week of the visit that there was a personal invitation from the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> to attend the Toronto event, it is not hard to picture this invitation becoming part of the discussion in the North Bay constituency office. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8178139" data-originallang="en">One can put themselves in the shoes of the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278667" href="/politicians/anthony-rota/" title="Anthony Rota">Nipissing—Timiskaming</a>. One is told about the individual's connection to Ukraine and is shown an invitation in the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>'s name, the name of the leader of the party whose label one is elected under. Is one really going to sit there and think they better second-guess the judgment of the PMO, the PCO and the diplomatic protocol office? I sincerely doubt it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8178140" data-originallang="en">As the member for <a data-HoCid="278667" href="/politicians/anthony-rota/" title="Anthony Rota">Nipissing—Timiskaming</a> said, “So who invited him? That's up for grabs”. That statement makes a whole lot more sense in light of yesterday's Globe report. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8178141" data-originallang="en">I would respectfully submit it is now obvious that the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> invited Yaroslav Hunka to meet the President of Ukraine, and the then Speaker took it on good faith and, in turn, authorized his own invitation. At the very least, it shows us that the protocol office itself, in the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>'s Office, had the name of this individual on its guest list. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8178142" data-originallang="en">Whatever happened between the Speaker's office and the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>'s Office in terms of the invitation, we now know that this individual, this former SS member, was already on the protocol list. He was already on the list of people to be invited.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8178143" data-originallang="en">On September 27, the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> told the House, “we apologized today on behalf of all parliamentarians. For the past few days, we have been saying how sorry we are about the mistake made by the Speaker of the House of Commons.” The only mistake, Mr. Speaker, was that your predecessor put blind trust in the fact that an invitation was issued by the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8178144" data-originallang="en">I am aware the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs has agreed to conduct some form of a study on the matter; although, the Liberal-NDP coalition does not seem to consider the matter important given that no hearings have yet to take place some five months later.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8178145" data-originallang="en">However, these revelations and the obvious concern that the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> appears to have misled the House are of a whole new dimension, one which engages the privileges of the House and rises, in my respectful submission, to a contempt of Parliament.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8178146" data-originallang="en">Page 85 of <em>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</em>, third edition, notes that cases of privilege have involved “the provision of deliberately misleading information to the House or one of its committees by a Minister or by a Member”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8178147" data-originallang="en">It is a well-established principle that to make out a prima facie case of privilege in relation to a claim of misleading the House, three elements must be established. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8178148" data-originallang="en">Firstly, it must be proven that the statement was misleading. Knowing what we know now from the Global Affairs Canada access to information release, we can see it was misleading. There is no doubt that members of Parliament, of all opposition parties, were trying to find out exactly what interaction, what role, was under the purview of the PMO or the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> for inviting this individual. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8178149" data-originallang="en">There were multiple questions coming from many different angles, and the government always gave the same explanation that it had absolutely no knowledge of this individual's background and that it had nothing to do with his invitation. We now know, through this access to information release, that is false and, therefore, misleading.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8178150" data-originallang="en">Secondly, it must be established that the member making the statement knew it to be misleading. The invitation that was released is in the name of the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>. To claim he had no knowledge of this individual is now absurd. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8178151" data-originallang="en">Thirdly, the misleading statement must have been offered with the intention to mislead the House. The House was engulfed in a massive international scandal, one which saw our own Speaker resign, falling on his sword for the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, so there is little doubt that the Prime Minister was eager to deflect his own role and responsibility and to lay the blame elsewhere. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8178152" data-originallang="en">Of course, before the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> might stand up and assert that he was blindsided by his own officials' denials, let me quote Bosc and Gagnon at page 116:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8178153" data-originallang="en"> Misleading a Minister or a Member has also been considered a form of obstruction and, thus, a prima facie breach of privilege. For example, on December 6, 1978, in finding that a prima facie contempt of the House existed, Speaker Jerome ruled that a government official, by deliberately misleading a Minister, had impeded the Member in the performance of his duties and consequently obstructed the House itself. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8178154" data-originallang="en">No matter how one cuts it, the House was misled. Its privileges were breached, and action should be taken immediately.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8178155" data-originallang="en">Should the Speaker agree with me that the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>'s words amount to a prima facie contempt, I am prepared to move the appropriate motion.</p>
