<p data-HoCid="8575692" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, we have all seen the attacks by Iran against Israel today, and of course we condemn them unequivocally.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8575693" data-originallang="en"> These attacks from Iran will only serve to further escalate the situation in the region. That is why I have been in contact with my Israeli counterpart this morning. I have been in contact with many G7 foreign ministers, as well as Arab countries' foreign ministers.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8575694" data-originallang="en"> This is a very dangerous time for the Middle East, and we need to make sure that this war stops.</p>
