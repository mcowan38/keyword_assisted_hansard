<p data-HoCid="8734240" data-originallang="en">I think the answer is yes, it would, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a non-starter. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8734241" data-originallang="en">As we've heard, there is a balancing act to be had when it comes to all of the rights. In a sense, that's built into our charter. We heard earlier that this is a hallmark of the Canadian approach, which is that these rights aren't absolute and there is a need to balance.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8734242" data-originallang="en">Balancing freedom of religion, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and association and some of those other rights is always going to be a challenge. When people use some of these rights to engage in conduct that quite clearly is not just harmful in terms of what's being said, but has real-world impact in terms of the safety of kids going to school or people going to their synagogues, there is a need to act.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8734243" data-originallang="en">We've seen some of that. We saw that, for example, with Samidoun fairly recently, which also had some of its people involved in some of these kinds of protests. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8734244" data-originallang="en">After more than a year of these experiences and this massive increase in targeting communities, in my case particularly the Jewish community, there is a need to act.</p>
