<p data-HoCid="8406304" data-originallang="en">I'm a queer Jew. My funding at my university goes to an initiative for queer people to feel safe. That same club posts images supporting October 7. I don't feel safe in queer spaces, and I should be feeling safe in those spaces. Our funding—my funding, my student funds—should go to those spaces to make sure I feel safe in them, because I can't take away one part of my identity. It's all my identity. I'm this one person, and I can't check it at the door, because it's who I am. </p>
