<p data-HoCid="7002397" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002398" data-originallang="fr">Thank you for inviting us today. I am here to testify on behalf of Oxfam.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002399" data-originallang="fr">Oxfam is an organization that works on the ground to provide a humanitarian response during emergencies and to support long-term community development. Our testimony is based on our direct, in-person knowledge of those impacted by human rights violations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002400" data-originallang="fr">In the first two years of the COVID‑19 pandemic, we have observed a major reduction in the space given to civil society organizations and an increase in inequality among those communities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002401" data-originallang="fr">Our observation is that a whole-of-government approach will be necessary to better protect human rights defenders and to reduce the obstacles that confront organizations working to provide humanitarian assistance in conflict situations. The various development services, foreign affairs, trade, diplomacy, defence and the environment, must absolutely come together and work together. In situations such as the one in Yemen, which I am going to tell you about, all those factors come into play and nothing can be done in a piecemeal fashion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002402" data-originallang="fr">The media has largely forgotten about the crisis in Yemen. However, according to the United Nations, the UN, it's one of the worst humanitarian crises ever. Two thirds of the 30 million Yemenis are living on humanitarian assistance. Thirteen million are experiencing serious food shortages, especially women and children.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002403" data-originallang="fr">Meanwhile, the conflict has raged on for seven years. Around 19,000 people have been killed and January 2022 was one of the most troubling months in terms of attacks. These include the destruction of a water supply and distribution system on which 120,000 people depend. Access to water is a basic right. Hospitals and schools have been destroyed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002404" data-originallang="fr">Currently, we know that the conflict is being fuelled by weapons coming from Saudi Arabia. We cannot guarantee that military equipment from Canada has not been used during those attacks. There have been investigations but, according to our research, they have not been conclusive.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002405" data-originallang="fr">Canada is a signatory to the Arms Trade Treaty. We must examine the issue of arms sales, and suspend the export of military equipment, to Saudi Arabia, as a number of other countries have done, such as Austria, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Finland, the Netherlands, and Sweden. We have a duty to protect.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002406" data-originallang="fr">Yemen is hardly talked about. The conflict has been going on for seven years. There is no joint, international action as we see with Ukraine. What is being done for Ukraine is really impressive. As someone said earlier, the system is working, people are coming together and concerted sanctions are being imposed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002407" data-originallang="fr">The Yemenis have been somewhat abandoned. I feel that the Government of Canada could address the situation by playing a stronger role. This will also take an intergovernmental approach. That is very important.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002408" data-originallang="fr">Allow me to make one final comment about Yemen. The UN Group of Eminent Experts on Yemen, a body created to monitor human rights violations in Yemen, was dissolved in October 2021 and has not been replaced.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002409" data-originallang="fr">January 2022 was a deadly month in the country. So it is important to create another independent mechanism, a replacement for the group of experts, to monitor what is happening in Yemen in terms of human rights violations and even to provide humanitarian assistance to the people directly affected.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002410" data-originallang="fr">Some of my colleagues have spoken at length about Palestine. So I will not do so, although I have things I could tell you. Instead, I will talk to you about Latin America.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002411" data-originallang="fr">In Colombia and Honduras, we are seeing an extremely troubling increase of violence against human rights defenders. They are victims of harassment, surveillance, defamation campaigns, threats, disappearances, physical assaults and, unfortunately, murder.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002412" data-originallang="fr">Indigenous and racialized people are particularly vulnerable as they defend their land and their natural resources against the establishment and proliferation of extractive industries, tourist projects and extensive monocultures.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002413" data-originallang="fr">Particularly noteworthy are the defamation campaigns against the women who lead human rights groups, especially indigenous women. These campaigns are aimed at the role of women in society and their sexuality.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002414" data-originallang="fr">We are also seeing a troubling increase of violence against LGBTI+ communities and especially against those standing up for the rights of those communities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002415" data-originallang="fr">Colombia, unfortunately, holds the sad world record for the number of human rights defenders who have been murdered. Despite a small drop in 2021, more than half the people killed around the world while defending their rights are from Colombia. That's 177 of 331 people, or 53%. It's terrible.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7002416" data-originallang="fr">In addition, in the regions of Central and South America—</p>
