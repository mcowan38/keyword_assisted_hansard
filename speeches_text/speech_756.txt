<p data-HoCid="6594667" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Ms. Gill.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6594668" data-originallang="en">Let me put it to the committee that access to the binders typically would not be in order. However, we could agree, on unanimous consent of the committee, notwithstanding the routine motion governing the distribution of documents, that Ms. Gill and Ms. Gazan be granted access to the committee's digital binders for the duration of this study on the matter of Bill <a data-HoCid="11007812" href="/bills/43-2/C-15/" title="An Act respecting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">C-15</a>. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6594669" data-originallang="en">Do we have any objections from anyone on our committee to allowing the digital binders to be shared?</p>
<p data-HoCid="6594670" data-originallang="en">Seeing none, I will ask for unanimous consent, by a show of hands, to allow the binders to be shared. </p>
