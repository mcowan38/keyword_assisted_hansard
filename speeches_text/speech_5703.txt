<p data-HoCid="8784149" data-originallang="en">It is the position of B'nai Brith Canada that the unfortunate rise in anti-Semitism and such recent events as protests that glorify and celebrate acts of terror, as we have seen on our streets, present us with the opportunity to re-examine the provisions of the Criminal Code that have been designed to prevent terrorism. These Criminal Code provisions need to be amended to ensure that the groups we are listing as terrorist entities are not celebrated and glorified on Canadian streets. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8784150" data-originallang="en">Yes, we do have provisions designed to prevent terrorism and its occurrence here in Canada, but we need to amend those to acknowledge the realities that we are currently seeing on Canadian streetsâ€”the display of the symbols of listed terror entities and the occurrence of rallies and vigils whose sole intent is to glorify the actions of terrorists. The existing legislation does not presently encapsulate the events we're seeing. It needs to be amended in order to respond to the problematic conduct we are witnessing on our streets, which is actually making a mockery of our current efforts to combat terrorism. </p>
