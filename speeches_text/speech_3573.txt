<p data-HoCid="8267729" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Madam Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8267730" data-originallang="en">I want to thank the witnesses. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8267731" data-originallang="en">I'm actually going to talk about something else. On December 11 I put forward a notice of motion related to a really important study. I know we don't have time to deal with this in my two and a half minutes. I just want to put it on the record that I will be moving the following at the next meeting of the committee, when we come back in two weeks:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8267732" data-originallang="en"> That pursuant to Standing Order 108(2) and in view of the alarming escalation of antisemitism in Canada, the committee undertake a study on the issue of antisemitism and the additional measures that could be taken to address the valid fears that are being expressed by Canadaâ€™s Jewish community. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8267733" data-originallang="en"> That the study include but not be limited to the issue of antisemitism on university campuses. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8267734" data-originallang="en"> That the study be at least three meetings and that the committee report its findings to the House. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8267735" data-originallang="en">I know that the subcommittee will be discussing this afterwards, but I also know that a lot of my colleagues sympathize and agree that this is an important study that we should be doing. This has not gone away since October 7. There has been a dramatic escalation in anti-Semitic incidents all across the country in Canada's big cities. That's not to say that there hasn't been an increase in other incidents for other communities, such as the Muslim community. I would welcome other studies on that issue as well. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8267736" data-originallang="en">With regard to the numbers on anti-Semitism, Jews constitute 1.1% of Canada's population, but over 70% of religious-based incidents are anti-Jewish. Students at campuses across the country have come to me. I have spoken at Hillels across the country. Yesterday at UBC, there was a referendum proposal to end the lease with Hillel. There are just constant incidents across the country. I think we as a committee have to do our due diligence in terms of looking at what we as a national government...and what moral suasion we can give to university administrations, municipal governments and provincial governments to act. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8267737" data-originallang="en">I appreciate that with my colleagues. I look forward to the subcommittee's discussing it. I intend to move that when we come back. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8267738" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
