<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I enjoy working with my colleague from <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> on the status of women committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">I have been listening to her speech, and I can understand how disappointed she is. We are disappointed on this side of the House as well. Very simply, will she vote against the budget, yes or no?</p>
