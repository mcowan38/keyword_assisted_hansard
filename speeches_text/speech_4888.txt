<p data-HoCid="8576556" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the member about the role the Iranian regime is playing in instigating violence against Israel, against peoples throughout the Middle East and, of course, against the people of Iran itself.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576557" data-originallang="en"> Six years ago, the House passed a motion calling on the government to list the IRGC as a terrorist organization. In fact, members of the government present that day voted in favour of the motion. However, it took six years for there to be any implementation of the motion. Unfortunately, in the intervening time, we have seen the further expansion of that regime's influence, the further empowering of terrorist organizations, which have continued to victimize people throughout the region and, in fact, here in Canada. We never got an answer from the government throughout that time on what its plans were. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8576558" data-originallang="en">In retrospect, does the member believe the government should have listed the IRGC much earlier and that more could have been done to limit its terroristic reach if it had been put on that terrorist list when the House initially voted to do so?</p>
