<p data-HoCid="8601971" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the only embarrassment is the NDP, which does not condemn people who are sympathizers of a terrorist regime that would burn a Canadian flag and say, “death to Canada”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8601972" data-originallang="en">The member brought up a phrase; she said “[no] moral fortitude”. “No moral fortitude” is how I would describe the NDP <a data-HoCid="278714" href="/politicians/jagmeet-singh/" title="Jagmeet Singh">leader</a>, someone who faked and put on a dramatic scene, ripping up their supply and confidence agreement, only to flip-flop two weeks later and tape it right back up just so the NDP could win a seat in Manitoba and use the people of Manitoba. That is no moral fortitude.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8601973" data-originallang="en">The NDP continues to prop up the most corrupt government in Canadian history. Maybe what it needs is some moral fortitude and some clarity to Canadians that we will not stand for anti-Semitism anymore in this country.</p>
