<p data-HoCid="6833821" data-originallang="en"> I call to order the 36th meeting of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6833822" data-originallang="en">Pursuant to Standing Order 108(2) and a motion that we adopted on Wednesday, June 9, the committee is resuming its study on ideologically motivated violent extremism. Later this afternoon we have some committee business that will be in camera.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6833823" data-originallang="en">We're fortunate today. I appreciate the understanding of both sets of witnesses, that they're able to appear with us together.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6833824" data-originallang="en">From the National Council of Canadian Muslims, we have Mustafa Farooq, chief executive officer, and Sameha Omer, director of legal affairs. From the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, we have Shimon Koffler Fogel, president and chief executive officer.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6833825" data-originallang="en">Again, I thank both groups for agreeing to appear. We look forward to your opening statements of seven minutes each.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6833826" data-originallang="en">With that, I'll turn to the National Council of Canadian Muslims.</p>
