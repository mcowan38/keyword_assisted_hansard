<p data-HoCid="8679364" data-originallang="en">I think the best role Canada can play is adhering to international law. We pride ourselves on having fidelity to the rules-based international legal order. Any solution to any conflict needs to be measured by and consistent with the firm guardrails of what international law requires. As I mentioned, the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, the ICJ, determined on July 19 that Israel's very presence in the occupied Palestinian territory is, in and of itself, unlawful and therefore an internationally wrongful act. The law on state responsibility does not require that the end of that act be made subject to negotiation. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679365" data-originallang="en">The same is true with respect to the Palestinian people's inalienable right to self-determination. If you require the end of the occupation and the Palestinian people's exercising of their right to self-determination to be subject to negotiation between a bad faith, belligerent occupier—that is physically in the territory and unlawfully colonizing it—and a defenceless population subject to its control, you're in effect giving the occupying power a veto, through negotiations, over the exercise of the Palestinian people's right to self-determination. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679366" data-originallang="en">Canada should abide by international law and encourage Israel to withdraw—as per the ICJ ruling—from the occupied Palestinian territory. Then two states can discuss other issues in negotiations between themselves.</p>
