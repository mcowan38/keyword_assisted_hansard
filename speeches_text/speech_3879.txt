<p data-HoCid="8309615" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8309616" data-originallang="en">I want to start by thanking all of our witnesses for their great testimony and for being here to answer some questions on this very important study brought forward by Leah Gazan, who is a big advocate of this and talks about it very often, and makes sure that we're talking about it here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8309617" data-originallang="en">My first question is going to Charlene, because you were the last one to testify and this one is top of mind for me.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8309618" data-originallang="en">You mentioned that policing is part of the problem, that law enforcement hasn't always sided with vulnerable indigenous women, and I agree, of course. I'm wondering what changes you think can be made to improve that situation and to improve collaboration with the police to make the red dress alert something the police are helpful with.</p>
