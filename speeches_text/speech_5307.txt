<p data-HoCid="8693831" data-originallang="en">It might surprise members of the committee to know that Avis supports a one-state solution. This is the map I got about eight years ago when I went to Israel to drive around. There's no indication of an occupied territory. It's all Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693832" data-originallang="en">Canada for years has allowed the conversation about a potential two-state negotiation to fester so that now this is normalized in Israel. Israelis believe this is all Israel; it's not a Palestinian territory. We've allowed that to develop by not insisting on a two-state solution, so I think that we are partly culpable for the situation today when the idea of Palestinian statehood is very low in Israel.</p>
