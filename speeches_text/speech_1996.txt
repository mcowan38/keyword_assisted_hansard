<p data-HoCid="7493658" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, last week new charges were laid in the murders of four more indigenous women.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7493659" data-originallang="en">Indigenous women and girls are 12 times more likely to be murdered or go missing than other women and girls across the country. This is an ongoing genocide, and we need urgent action from all levels of government to keep indigenous women safe.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7493660" data-originallang="en">Will the minister commit to doing what the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> and other indigenous leaders have called for, and provide immediate funds and resources to end this cycle of violence?</p>
