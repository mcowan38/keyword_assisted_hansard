<p data-HoCid="8763130" data-originallang="en"> We're talking about the continuum of minority language education services. I think Mr. Lightbound spoke to this. I'd like to continue that about the earliest part of that education in child care situationsâ€”preschool, if you will</p>
<p data-HoCid="8763131" data-originallang="en">I know that my colleague <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Leah Gazan</a>, the MP for Winnipeg Centre, introduced an amendment to Bill <a data-HoCid="12138647" href="/bills/44-1/C-35/" title="An Act respecting early learning and child care in Canada">C-35</a> that supported the availability of minority language child care across Canada. If you're a francophone family in Manitoba or British Columbia, it would be good to have child care available in French, for instance.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8763132" data-originallang="en">I'm just wondering if you could further comment on that and what that provision in Bill <a data-HoCid="12138647" href="/bills/44-1/C-35/" title="An Act respecting early learning and child care in Canada">C-35</a> might mean to that situation.</p>
