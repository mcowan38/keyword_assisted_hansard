<p data-HoCid="8405967" data-originallang="en"> My grandfather was born in a refugee camp outside of Yemen in the British protectorate of Aden because Jews were being persecuted, and my grandmother was born in Morocco when Jews were being persecuted, and Israel was the only country that took them in. I would not be alive today if it were not for the State of Israel. When I see a sign on my campus saying “No Zionists allowed”, that means no Jews allowed. That is terrifying.</p>
