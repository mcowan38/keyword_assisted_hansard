<p data-HoCid="8551698" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for <a data-HoCid="278546" href="/politicians/arielle-kayabaga/" title="Arielle Kayabaga">London West</a>. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8551699" data-originallang="en">It is a pleasure to rise for the first time in this House after the summer recess to represent the good people of West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast—Sea to Sky Country. It is especially important today because we are debating Bill <a data-HoCid="13103731" href="/bills/44-1/C-71/" title="An Act to amend the Citizenship Act (2024)">C-71</a>, an act to amend the Citizenship Act. It is very important that we start our session with this legislation because it strikes right at the core of what it means to be Canadian or, rather, how. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8551700" data-originallang="en">What do Mary Pickford, Leslie Nielsen, Ricky Gervais, Jimi Hendrix, Glenn Ford and Roméo Dallaire all have in common? These folks are well known as eminent Canadians, but they are also what are known as lost Canadians. Lost Canadians are individuals who were born in Canada or believed they were Canadian citizens but who lost or never acquired citizenship due to certain provisions in our outdated and confusing citizenship legislation. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8551701" data-originallang="en">For instance, first-generation Canadians born abroad are unable to confer citizenship to their children, and those born to a first-generation Canadian abroad automatically lose their citizenship at the age of 28 due to a cruel and unconstitutional law passed by the Harper Conservative government. The legislation we are debating today would fix these issues by amending the Citizenship Act to extend access to citizenship to descent beyond the first generation. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8551702" data-originallang="en">Once passed, Bill <a data-HoCid="13103731" href="/bills/44-1/C-71/" title="An Act to amend the Citizenship Act (2024)">C-71</a> will automatically confer citizenship by descent to all those born abroad to Canadian parents before the coming-into-force date of the legislation. For those born after the coming-into-force date, there would be a new framework governing citizenship where citizenship by descent can be passed on beyond the first generation if a Canadian parent is present in Canada for 195 days straight, in what is being called the substantial connection test. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8551703" data-originallang="en">Bill <a data-HoCid="13103731" href="/bills/44-1/C-71/" title="An Act to amend the Citizenship Act (2024)">C-71</a> would also allow people born abroad and adopted by a Canadian citizen who was born abroad to have a pathway to citizenship by way of a grant of citizenship. This different process is required because to comply with the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption, which seeks to protect the child's best interest and prevent abuses such as the abduction, sale and trafficking of children, an assessment is necessary to ensure that an adoption complies with international adoption requirements. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8551704" data-originallang="en">Many of those currently affected by this issue are, in fact, children who are unable to access Canadian citizenship and the benefits that we so often take for granted, such as access to universal health care and education. The consequences these children face as a result of this outdated legislation are unacceptable. Take, for instance, the story of 12-year-old Zach Hirschfeld. He was born in Mexico to his Canadian father Bert, who was born in the United States and later naturalized to become a Canadian citizen. At the time, Zach's Canadian grandmother could not confer citizenship to Zach's father due to the discrimination against women that remains embedded in the Citizenship Act, which I will get to later in my speech. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8551705" data-originallang="en">Last year, Zach applied for proof of citizenship and was denied. As a naturalized Canadian, Bert was deemed to be born in Canada and thus could confer citizenship to his son, but this was later rescinded by Conservative Bill <a data-HoCid="3188741" href="/bills/39-2/C-37/" title="An Act to amend the Citizenship Act">C-37</a> when it became law. Under Bill C-37, Conservatives took away the right for Canadians born abroad to pass on citizenship to their children. This law not only separated families, but created an undemocratic tiered system of citizenship and a new class of Canadians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8551706" data-originallang="en">Today, Zach does not have citizenship in Mexico or Canada, and there is a legitimate question of him being stateless. Zach's father tragically died during COVID and his family in Vancouver wants him to live with them. The problem is that Zach has no legal status in Canada and thus cannot enrol in school, get medical coverage or get a social insurance number. To access these things, he needs to become a Canadian citizen. Under Bill <a data-HoCid="13103731" href="/bills/44-1/C-71/" title="An Act to amend the Citizenship Act (2024)">C-71</a>, he would.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8551707" data-originallang="en">To be clear, this is not an issue of immigration, as some members of the opposition claim. This is an issue of citizenship. As we can see from Zach's story, it is also an issue of equality and women's rights. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8551708" data-originallang="en">Prior to 1977, women could not confer citizenship on their children. Instead, children were seen as property of the father if they were born in wedlock, and property of the mother if born out of wedlock. This inequality has lasting impacts on new generations of Canadians born abroad. Bill <a data-HoCid="13103731" href="/bills/44-1/C-71/" title="An Act to amend the Citizenship Act (2024)">C-71</a> would correct this by acknowledging the rights of second-generation Canadians born abroad to obtain citizenship, including descendants of women who previously could not confer citizenship due to these inequalities. This is not only the right thing to do; it is also necessary in order to make sure the legislation is compliant with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8551709" data-originallang="en">Bill <a data-HoCid="13103731" href="/bills/44-1/C-71/" title="An Act to amend the Citizenship Act (2024)">C-71</a> would also bring our laws into compliance with international standards set by the United Nations. Currently our legislation violates the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which states that all children have a right to education. It violates the UN Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, which outlines the measures countries must take to provide a nationality to those who are stateless. It also violates the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8551710" data-originallang="en">While the bill is a step in the right direction, there is more work that needs to be done to ensure that citizenship remains protected. However, we know that not all parties in the House share this view. With the passage of Bill <a data-HoCid="3188741" href="/bills/39-2/C-37/" title="An Act to amend the Citizenship Act">C-37</a> in 2009, the Conservatives demonstrated their willingness to strip Canadians of their rights and identity. In 2014, the Conservatives also passed Bill <a data-HoCid="6401990" href="/bills/41-2/C-24/" title="An Act to amend the Citizenship Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts">C-24</a>, which allowed them to revoke the citizenship of dual citizens. This created an entire category of second-class citizens whose status as Canadians is insecure.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8551711" data-originallang="en">Further, we know that the <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">Leader of the Opposition</a>'s flagship bill as the minister of democratic reform was to make it harder for indigenous people, youth and less affluent people to vote. We already know that the Conservatives would not care about being out of compliance with international law, because they have openly committed to withdrawing from the United Nations. Even more concerning is that the leader of the Conservative Party has committed to ignoring charter-protected rights and freedoms by invoking the notwithstanding clause. We would not be able to rely on the courts to protect us from the Conservatives' revoking citizenship, which can be changed on a whim.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8551712" data-originallang="en">Let us think of what those whims may be, because we know the tried-and-true playbook that the Conservatives use to ostracize minority groups to create fear in the population of people they do not know, to rally support. We know this is an effective method, but that is why we should be concerned to see the <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">Conservative leader</a> cozying up to white national groups, and it even filters into the anti-trans policy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8551713" data-originallang="en">The complete and utter silence of the Conservatives on the plight of Palestinians over the last year has been deafening. How safe would someone feel in protesting in support of the Palestinian cause under a Conservative government? We already saw the Conservatives label environmentalists as a violent threat to Canada's security, pass legislation to spy on environmental NGOs and weaponize the Canada Revenue Agency to silence awareness that these groups were raising about the impact of fossil fuels.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8551714" data-originallang="en">How safe would someone feel speaking out about the impacts of climate change? How safe would someone feel about their Canadian citizenship? The answer is that they would probably feel a lot safer in an insurrection to overthrow the government because they might get brought coffee and donuts.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8551715" data-originallang="en">Therefore, I believe that citizenship should be enshrined as a right rather than a revocable privilege, so that we can protect all Canadians, whether dual citizen or not, born in or out of wedlock, adopted or not, from the Conservatives or any future government, from manipulating citizenship laws to exclude those they do not agree with. This risks eroding our democratic principles and turning citizenship into a privilege rather than a fundamental human right.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8551716" data-originallang="en">There also remain questions regarding when citizenship in Canada began. For many, it is assumed it began with the introduction of the Citizenship Act in 1947. However, that would mean that thousands of Canadian servicemen and women who died in the First World War and the Second World War would not be technically considered Canadian citizens. This ambiguity goes beyond just legal definitions; it influences how we remember our history and those who contributed to it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8551717" data-originallang="en">Citizenship provides us with a sense of duty and belonging to the country we all are proud to call home. With the passage of Bill <a data-HoCid="13103731" href="/bills/44-1/C-71/" title="An Act to amend the Citizenship Act (2024)">C-71</a>, the Citizenship Act would have laws that are equally enforced and consistent with international human rights principles for the first time in Canadian history. It would grant citizenship to individuals like Zach, for whom there is genuine fear they may become stateless. It is an opportunity for us to modernize our citizenship legislation to ensure that those who rightfully deserve to be Canadian citizens do not get left behind. I hope all members of the House will support the legislation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8551718" data-originallang="en">I want to give a special shout-out to Don Chapman, a constituent of mine in Gibsons who has worked so hard to move the legislation forward through the courts, and today through legislation we are debating.</p>
