I wish to very briefly add to the submissions made by my colleague, the member for <a data-HoCid="278731" href="/politicians/melissa-lantsman/" title="Melissa Lantsman">Thornhill</a>, on the question of privilege she raised last Friday.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8777131" data-originallang="en">I wish to add that the member for <a data-HoCid="278619" href="/politicians/blake-desjarlais/" title="Blake Desjarlais">Edmonton Griesbach</a> was among the NDP MPs who participated in the anti-Israel demonstration. My staff observed the member among the protesters as they blocked the driveway in front of the Confederation Building.</p>
