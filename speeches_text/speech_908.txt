<p data-HoCid="6623553" data-originallang="fr"> Madam Speaker, as I enter my ninth year of remission following treatment for testicular cancer, I rise today to recognize the hard work of nurses and all frontline health care workers who continue to save lives during this health crisis.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6623554" data-originallang="en">Yesterday, as I walked through the halls of Montreal's Jewish General Hospital for my annual blood work and X-rays, the experience was understandably different, but one thing remained the same: the dedication and resolve of our nurses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6623555" data-originallang="en">I strain to find the words to describe my gratitude to the nurses who cared for me and, indeed, care for us all, so I will try to sum up these heroes with one anecdote. As I was leaving the hospital yesterday, one of the nurses who treated me looked at her colleague and said, “Okay, see you tomorrow. I'm off to the clinic. It's vaccines time”, because in addition to working her shift, she was also giving her time delivering life-saving vaccines to us and those we love.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6623556" data-originallang="fr">They are true heroes. On behalf of everyone in this House, I sincerely thank them for everything they do for us and for all Canadians. </p>
