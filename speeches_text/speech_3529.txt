<p data-HoCid="8222879" data-originallang="fr">Good morning, everyone.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8222880" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Chair, thank you for your warm introduction. I'd also like to thank the committee for inviting me to appear before you today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8222881" data-originallang="fr">I'm here as chair of the Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade. I'm going to talk about our committee's report, “More than a Vocation: Canada's need for a 21st Century Foreign Service,” that was tabled in the Senate on December 6, 2023.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8222882" data-originallang="fr">Prior to our committee's study, the last in‑depth review of our foreign service was done in 1981. It resulted in the release of a report by the Royal Commission on Conditions of Foreign Service, headed by Commissioner Pamela A. McDougall, a former Canadian diplomat.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8222883" data-originallang="en"> The key question guiding the Senate committee's study was: Are Global Affairs Canada and the Canadian foreign service fit for purpose?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8222884" data-originallang="en">Our answer is yes, but with several caveats. Over 16 meetings between April 2022 and June 2023, we were guided by 22 hours of testimony from expert witnesses ranging from current and former ministers, including one former prime minister, to retired practitioners, academics, younger serving officers and members of employee-led networks within the department.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8222885" data-originallang="en">The Senate committee also undertook productive fact-finding missions to Washington in December 2022 and to London, Oslo and Berlin in September 2023. That's because several of our major allies, including Germany, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States, have also undertaken or are in the process of undertaking reviews of their own foreign services.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8222886" data-originallang="en">We made 29 recommendations designed to strengthen the already considerable abilities of Canada's foreign service. The results of our survey, launched in the Senate before the announcement of the department's own “Future of Diplomacy” review, is an excellent and comprehensive report, but, of course, I'm biased.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8222887" data-originallang="en">The Senate committee's recommendations span areas including organizational structure and coherence, recruitment, career management and conditions of foreign service. Among our concerns is staffing. The foreign service is still feeling the effects of a suspension in recruitment between 2009 and 2019.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8222888" data-originallang="en">Recent events have also underscored the importance of a foreign service that can respond with agility to emergencies, including evacuating Canadians from conflict zones such as Lebanon, Afghanistan, Ukraine, Sudan and Gaza; however, we heard that the department's search capacity should be increased. That's why the Senate committee strongly recommends that Global Affairs Canada run an annual entry-level foreign service officer recruitment campaign to fill vacancies and create that needed surge capacity.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8222889" data-originallang="en">It should also recruit more mid-career professionals from other government departments and from outside government altogether. Our study revealed that generalist knowledge is prioritized over specific thematic expertise, due in part to some of the staffing challenges.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8222890" data-originallang="en">Russia and China will continue to hold the world's attention for years. That means that Russia and China specialists, people with understanding of the languages, cultures and goals of these countries and governments, are invaluable.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8222891" data-originallang="en">This is why the Senate committee urges Global Affairs Canada to increase investment in foreign language training and to provide opportunities for Canada-based staff trained in a foreign language to maintain their foreign language skills throughout their careers.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8222892" data-originallang="en">This also speaks to our recommendation on the equal use of French and English within the department and to ensure that, <em>ab initio</em>, official language training is maintained for new hires.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8222893" data-originallang="en">The conditions of the foreign service could also be improved. The foreign service directives provide for allowances and benefits for staff serving abroad. Because they have not been reviewed since 1981, the Senate committee strongly urges a complete modernization of the foreign service directives to ensure that they are adapted to the current and evolving realities faced by Canada's public servants.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8222894" data-originallang="en">What happens around the world impacts us here at home, from economic security to physical security, and Canada's foreign service, through a broad range of duties, is at the forefront of mitigating negative impacts and taking advantage of opportunities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8222895" data-originallang="en">This goes to the heart of the committee's first recommendation, that Global Affairs Canada must do a far better job of communicating to Canadians what it and the foreign service specifically do.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8222896" data-originallang="en">There is hard work ahead, and what the Senate committee recommended is not the end of it. We did not even get into costing issues. We need to ensure that our talented people have the tools, skill sets, funding and consistent, non-partisan political support to do their jobs.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8222897" data-originallang="en">Again, thank you for the invitation to be here today. I'll be pleased to answer any questions you might have.</p>
