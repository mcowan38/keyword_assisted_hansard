<p data-HoCid="8277193" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the key thing here is that we cannot expand the scope to take in more subject matter than was in the original motion. We see that one of the amendments proposed by the government would expand to deal with settlements on the West Bank. This is not a motion about the West Bank. It is about Gaza. Indulging in a discussion about aspects of Israeli policy that deal with some other area, with Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Syria and the occupation of the Golan, is outside the original scope.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8277194" data-originallang="en">It is very nice that the government would like to add the settlements on the West Bank. Perhaps they should have been in the original motion, but they are not. They are part of a separate topic. The government cannot now violate parliamentary practices based on the fact that its members think they should have been included.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8277195" data-originallang="en">The government should have debated this before introducing the motion and not change it now at the end of debate. That is well beyond the scope of the original motion.</p>
