<p data-HoCid="8455521" data-originallang="fr">I understand that the Criminal Code contains definitions. I'll be more specific if that's okay with you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455522" data-originallang="fr">The Criminal Code currently contains a provision, in section 319, which states that “[no] person shall be convicted of an offence” of antisemitism “if, in good faith, they expressed or attempted to establish by an argument an opinion on a religious subject or an opinion based on a belief in a religious text”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455523" data-originallang="fr">In your opinion, should an exception of this nature—that is to say that hate can be promoted based on a religious text—be maintained or should it be reviewed?</p>
