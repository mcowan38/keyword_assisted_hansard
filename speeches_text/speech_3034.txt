<p data-HoCid="8040688" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8040689" data-originallang="en">I want to again thank our witnesses who are here and coming back to see us today. I have a couple of questions, so I'm going to try to stay as succinct as I can.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8040690" data-originallang="en">We know that in addition to some of the concerns of domestic challenges—flood, wildfires and other natural disasters—we're also experiencing different international pressures, such as the war in Ukraine and now the conflict in the Middle East, in Gaza.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8040691" data-originallang="en">I would like to hear from each of you, particularly if you can speak to how your department balances the pressures of meeting the urgent operational requirements while also continuing to meet the procurement needs at the same time.</p>
