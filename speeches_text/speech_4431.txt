<p data-HoCid="8454158" data-originallang="en"> The Gaza program was designed specifically as a temporary resident program for three years, not knowing what the outcome of this would be for a number of reasons. I think there are very important geopolitical considerations, particularly with some of the rhetoric around the emptying of Gaza and the perception that Canada would be participating in that. It's quite the contrary. We're participating in trying to save lives. </p>
