<p data-HoCid="8276038" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, clearly my colleague has not read the motion and did not listen to my speech. I was very clear that what Hamas did on October 7 is appalling. It is written into our motion what actions we are calling for with regard to Hamas. I spoke very clearly about that, so if she would like me to explain the motion to her again, perhaps the Speaker could read it for her again.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8276039" data-originallang="en">However, because she did ask me that, I just want to finish off with a poem from Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish, who wrote <em>The War Will End</em>:</p>
<p data-HoCid="8276040" data-originallang="en"> <span class="verse"> The war will end<br> The leaders will shake hands<br> The old woman will keep waiting for her martyred son<br> That girl will wait for her beloved husband<br> And those children will wait for their heroic father<br> I don't know who sold our homeland<br> But I saw who paid the price.<br> </span> <span class="verse"> The War Will End<br> </span> </p>
