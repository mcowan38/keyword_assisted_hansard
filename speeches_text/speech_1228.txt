<p data-HoCid="6802865" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, across the country Canadians have been coming together to grieve our past and present actions of discrimination and racism in this country, whether it is the long history of abuse toward our indigenous peoples as we unearth the tragic killings and disappearances of our innocent children at the hands of our institutions, or the recent rise of anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, anti-Black racism, anti-Asian racism and xenophobia. I vow to do everything in my power to fight against hate in all its forms. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6802866" data-originallang="en"> Last night I attended a vigil in Brampton commemorating the tragedy in London, where a family of four was killed solely because they were Muslim. Islamophobia has no place in Canada. Every Canadian, regardless of race and creed, deserves to live in peace and security, and my heart goes out to the victims, loved ones and the entire Muslim community.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6802867" data-originallang="en">As we build back better, all of us must step up to make our communities safer and more inclusive.</p>
