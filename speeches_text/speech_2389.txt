<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en"> <em>Uqaqtittiji</em>, I would also like to send my condolences to the family in the member's riding.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">I really appreciated the member's intervention, because he seems to be taking Bill <a data-HoCid="12138647" href="/bills/44-1/C-35/" title="An Act respecting early learning and child care in Canada">C-35</a> seriously and not talking only about the motion about the short title.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">The bill is especially important for Nunavummiut. I do not know if members have read the Auditor General's report published on May 30 about Inuit children's and youth's rights being infringed. There are many children and youth who are in care, but who also who do not need to be in care. Preferably, Bill <a data-HoCid="12138647" href="/bills/44-1/C-35/" title="An Act respecting early learning and child care in Canada">C-35</a> would help make sure that families are able to get the supports they need to use day care, rather than having their children stolen by governments.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">What I do appreciate about the bill as well, and I thank the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> for her great work, is that it includes the importance of upholding indigenous rights, because of the inclusion of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the implementation of UNDRIP. I wonder if the member agrees that it is absolutely necessary that we pass Bill <a data-HoCid="12138647" href="/bills/44-1/C-35/" title="An Act respecting early learning and child care in Canada">C-35</a> so indigenous children's rights can be upheld.</p>
