<p data-HoCid="7372410" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, as I have stated before and will say again, anti-Semitism, hate and racism have no place in our society. The funding to this organization has been cut, and we have demanded repayment of the funding. We are implementing new measures to improve the Department of Canadian Heritage's vetting processes to ensure that this never happens again.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7372411" data-originallang="en">On this side of the House, we will ensure that we always stand against anti-Semitism and hate in all its forms.</p>
