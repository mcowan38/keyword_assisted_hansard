<p data-HoCid="8451185" data-originallang="en"> While I have no problem amending the motion to have <a data-HoCid="278777" href="/politicians/pascale-st-onge/" title="Pascale St-Onge">the minister</a> for one hour and officials for the other hour—which is in accordance with other committees—we in the NDP oppose the current amendment ahead of us, and certainly the proposal to eliminate the date.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8451186" data-originallang="en">This is obviously close to the end of the session. We feel that we've been waiting for the anti-racism strategy for months. The fact that we possibly won't be able to hear from <a data-HoCid="278777" href="/politicians/pascale-st-onge/" title="Pascale St-Onge">the minister</a> until before the end of session is simply not acceptable on something as important as an anti-racism strategy, and the inclusion of anti-Palestinian racism as part of that strategy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8451187" data-originallang="en">We will be opposing these two measures.</p>
