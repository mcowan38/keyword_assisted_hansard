<p data-HoCid="8731466" data-originallang="en"> Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8731467" data-originallang="en">I have a point of order on a procedural matter that I'd just like you to confirm, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8731468" data-originallang="en">We are continuing after the suspension, but we have that 106(4) request, as you've outlined. It is my understanding that, once those issues of the matters in the suspension are resolved, we would go into the 106(4) matter, which is, of course, about the ISIS terrorist plot to bomb Parliament Hill and a Jewish gathering that had MPs and others there. Of course, we sent a letter to the chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8731469" data-originallang="en">Can you just confirm that, if the matter at hand is resolved and the Liberals end the filibuster, we would go into the 106(4) if we deal with that motion first?</p>
