<p data-HoCid="6415369" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6415370" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Ms. Hicks, for your responses earlier.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6415371" data-originallang="fr">I'll now turn to Ms. Triggs.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6415372" data-originallang="fr">Unfortunately, I have very little time. I'll ask you three questions at once. If you don't have enough time to answer the three questions, I would appreciate it if you could send us additional written comments.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6415373" data-originallang="fr">Ms. Triggs, we know that the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees works with various sister agencies, including UNRWA, the agency for Palestinian refugees. Some agencies, including this one, are experiencing funding issues that pose a threat to their operations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6415374" data-originallang="fr">How is this funding issue being addressed for a number of agencies working with refugees on the ground?</p>
<p data-HoCid="6415375" data-originallang="fr">We saw that people tried to leave Hong Kong by sea, but were intercepted by the Chinese authorities. How does the Office of the High Commissioner anticipate possible population displacements in order to ensure the safety of people who want to leave Hong Kong and seek refuge elsewhere?</p>
<p data-HoCid="6415376" data-originallang="fr">What can you tell us about the displacement of people following the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh?</p>
