<p data-HoCid="8074417" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, Canada was the first western government to take action, by providing $60 million in aid for civilians affected by the conflict in Gaza. This included a matching fund that brought in 12 Canadian humanitarian organizations. I am pleased to share with the House that Canadians from coast to coast to coast donated almost $14 million to this campaign, and we will double this amount to nearly $28 million. The funding will go to providing much-needed water, food and medicines to all civilians affected by the conflict.</p>
