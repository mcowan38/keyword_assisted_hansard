<p data-HoCid="6935546" data-originallang="en"> I think it's really important to consider, first of all, that there are some thriving centres of tech across the country. Six months ago nobody would have thought that Alberta would have been such a tech hub, and there's a lot of tech activity also happening in your home province as well. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6935547" data-originallang="en">If the idea is to create new structures maybe adjacent to the superclusters program, or I guess even in thinking about what the new CARPA program will look like, it's going to be really critical to understand what those investments look like for companies and make sure that they're serving the local, domestic ecosystem.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6935548" data-originallang="en">I talked a little bit about research and development tax credits in my deputation. Our budget submission also spends a lot of time talking about creating what we like to call “marketplace frameworks”, which include the right standards and regulations to ensure that the wealth is staying here in Canada and servicing Canadians. That means that ideas that are generated are not picked off and taken out of Canada—and that's protected through tools like a patent box or through the Innovation Asset Collective that the government has already established to protect IP. A lot of that really has to be done in concert with Canadian technology companies. </p>
