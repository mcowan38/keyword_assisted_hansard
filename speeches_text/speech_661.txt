<p data-HoCid="6524760" data-originallang="en">We're here to talk about the variants, and certainly the one think that's spreading the most in Canada is the British variant, which, in my understanding, may be more infectious but the vaccines still work on it. It seems to me the biggest question concerning vaccination right now is how far we can go between the first shot and the second booster shot. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6524761" data-originallang="en">I know Moderna has done studies that show after one dose it has a 92% efficacy. I think you will probably be familiar with the data coming out of Quebec that showed that 80% of elderly people were covered after three weeks, and I think that 80% of health care workers were covered after two weeks. I know in Quebec the strategy has been to prolong the period between the first and second shot. Certainly if you can go three months, that will double our ability to get people vaccinated quickly. Let me throw in there that I think Israel had some concerns with one shot being effective in the elderly.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6524762" data-originallang="en">I know there may be some competing data out there, but I wonder if the Public Health Agency of Canada or NACI will be making recommendations about the interval between first and second dose, and at the moment what are those recommendations?</p>
