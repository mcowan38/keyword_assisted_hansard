<p data-HoCid="8737302" data-originallang="en"> I work in the lobster industry. In southern Nova Scotia mainly it's a big part of the economy. Dumping Day is coming next week and you'll see the MPs and MLAs out there wishing the lobstermen a safe, prosperous trip. I always post and remind them about the seasonal workers in the lobster pounds. Without them, the lobsters do not move. They're not worth anything if we don't go in.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8737303" data-originallang="en"> My typical day might start at three in the morning. I know the day before. And I've gone to work at three in the morning until six. I'll grab a coffee at McDonald's and drive a half hour and text my boss at the other place and tell them I'll be asleep in your parking lot, grabbing a half hour sleep, just before I start my next job at the other lobster pound. To juggle both, it's a hard thing to do when they need you and somebody else needs you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8737304" data-originallang="en"> In the off-season, they say, why can't you get a job? My season runs from the end of November to the end of May, but there are always lobsters in the pound until fall. I might have a really busy week and then some days, some weeks, it might be 20 hours a week. </p>
