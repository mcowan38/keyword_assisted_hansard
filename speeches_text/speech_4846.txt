<p data-HoCid="8568746" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, Canada and the world will soon observe the first anniversary of the October 7 massacre carried out by Hamas terrorists against innocent Israeli citizens. For almost a year, the Liberal government has turned a blind eye to numerous pro-Hamas rallies that incite violence and hatred. Jewish-owned Canadian businesses have been vandalized, schools and synagogues shot at, and people assaulted. Even my wife was stalked, and our home targeted with posters falsely claiming that I support genocide. I support the rule of law.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8568747" data-originallang="en"> However, hate promoters like Samidoun, an entity outlawed in Germany with its leader banned from the EU, are free to have a rally in Vancouver to celebrate a terrorist act. Other rallies will also be held to support Hamas. Thanks to U.S. intelligence, Canada thwarted one terrorist attack being planned on Canadian soil by a foreign national to mark the anniversary. Does someone have to be killed before the Liberal government acts to keep Canadians safe in the lead-up to October 7 and beyond?</p>
