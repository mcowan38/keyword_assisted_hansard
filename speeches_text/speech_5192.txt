<p data-HoCid="8683561" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Dr. Ge.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8683562" data-originallang="en">You talked about the chilling effect and impacts on others. I just want to take it back a step. We know that freedom of expression is critical to a healthy democracy. It is seen as a fundamental right here in Canada, yet your experience proves that Canadians such as you are targeted for speaking out in favour of human rights, in favour of peace and in favour of international law.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8683563" data-originallang="en">You gave the example of this plastic surgeon. Have you connected with others? Have others come to you to speak about how speaking out about Palestine has had negative impacts on their livelihoods or their reputations? What have you heard from others, whether in the medical field or beyond?</p>
