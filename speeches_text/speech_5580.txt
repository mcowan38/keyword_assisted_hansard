<p data-HoCid="8736642" data-originallang="en"> Professor SÃ©rafin, I am interested in your statement, and I'm curious whether you can walk me through.... I actually think what you're talking about provokes a series of interesting questions related, in particular, to the notion of freedom and the way in which we deal with expression.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8736643" data-originallang="en"> You have seen the good and the bad of conversations on campus. I've read some of your work. Campuses have become very interesting places for debate and discussion over the last little while. Briefly, I would like your honest opinion about what we hear as polarizing natures of conversation. We have Jewish students who feel that they can't speak their mind. We have students who are supporting the Palestinian cause saying that they feel their freedoms are being stifled in expression. In all of this, we are grappling with communities that are hurting, angry and frustrated. At what point does this whole notion of freedom, particularly of expression, become something that we need to be looking at differently, or are those debates, discussions and confrontations healthy for our democracy?</p>
