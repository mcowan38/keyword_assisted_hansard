<p data-HoCid="8369892" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, I've let this go several times, but it is against the rules of the House, which apply in this committee, to impugn the motives of other members. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8369893" data-originallang="en">Mr. Moore has used the word "blackmail". He's used other things to imply what the motivations of other members are in supporting this bill. I unreservedly support this bill. I have no other motivations. I would very much like to move on to the study of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. It is out of order and a breach of privilege for Mr. Moore to imply that we have motives other than those we have stated in this committee. </p>
