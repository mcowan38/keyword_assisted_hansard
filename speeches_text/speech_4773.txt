<p data-HoCid="8592274" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8592275" data-originallang="en">I will speak to the amendment, but since I haven't had a chance to speak to the motion, I want to refer to both of them throughout my conversation. I won't take too long. I think any conversation on this subject will be difficult. There are G7 parliaments and parliaments around the world discussing this conversation. I think we should, as parliamentarians, have a robust conversation about the issues in the Middle East at this time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8592276" data-originallang="en">I always begin this conversation by talking about the heinous attack that happened on October 7. It was the largest attack on Israel, the Israeli people and, really, the Jewish population of the world by the terrorist organization Hamas. We will be approaching the first anniversary of that very soon. It has to be emblazoned in our minds and our memories as something that continues, as hostages still have not been released and as that war continues.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8592277" data-originallang="en">At the very same time, we are cognizant of the huge civilian casualties that have happened in Gaza as well as, frankly, in the West Bank in recent weeks. The large toll is the more than 40,000 people in Gaza who have lost their lives, including some 17,000 children. We recognize that Canada is one of the leading nations in calling for a ceasefire. We took a little time on that, I will say, as many countries did, because we also recognize Israel's right to defend itself from a terrorist attack. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8592278" data-originallang="en">However, the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, as the head of the government, has been very clear that there needs to be a negotiated ceasefire, that hostages need to be returned, that both sides need to lay down their arms and that it should happen immediately. A variety of peace proposals have happened. Canada continues to work with a number of partners on those proposals, but we are extremely concerned about the continued loss of civilian lives. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8592279" data-originallang="en">We do put a responsibility on Hamas as the instigator of this conflict. We also put a responsibility on Israel to follow the rule of law with respect to war. We have also been very clear about that. These are complex, complicated and interwoven issues. The government has been attempting to provide assistance in world fora on this, and we'll continue to do that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8592280" data-originallang="en">While we are calling for an immediate ceasefire, the laying down of arms by both parties, the release of hostages by Hamas and the delivery of humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza, we also have in our sights a two-state solution. That is firmly embedded in the government's policy. I fear that it is waning in some people's minds and that the events of October 7 have actually derailed other people's commitment to a two-state solution. Canada remains firmly in favour of a two-state solution and in taking steps to ensure a two-state solution.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8592281" data-originallang="en">If we are to have a two-state solution, Mr. Chair, we need two states. That is very clear. Canada is a friend and ally of the State of Israel. We've been a friend to the Palestinian people. However, our <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> has been very clear that the recognition of the state of Palestine has to be done “at the right time, not necessarily as the last step along the path.” Let me say that again. The Government of Canada is prepared to recognize the state of Palestine “at the right time, not necessarily as the last step along the path.” </p>
<p data-HoCid="8592282" data-originallang="en">The <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> also said: </p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8592283" data-originallang="en"> ...we urgently need to build a credible path toward lasting peace. We oppose efforts by the Netanyahu government to reject a two-state solution. At the same time, Hamas, a terrorist group, currently controls areas in Gaza and has not laid down its arms or released its hostages. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8592284" data-originallang="en"> That is the reality of the situation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8592285" data-originallang="en">The reason we will continue to support the motion that was made is that we believe the best place to give government advice on those conditions for the right time for the recognition of the state of Palestine is in this committee. This is a forum where we can bring experts, academics, international NGOs and Canadians from a variety of opinions and backgrounds to find a way to advise the government as parliamentarians as to the conditions and the timing that will bring a lasting peace, a peace with justice.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8592286" data-originallang="en">This is something many of us have been committed to for decades. There is a huge possibility that this can happen in the very near future. There's also a chance it could be completely derailed for generations, so I think it's incumbent upon this committee to very seriously look at this issue to recognize that we're not all of the same opinion on this committee. There are a variety of opinions. There's probably a spectrum. In our House of Commons, we're not all of the same opinion. In the country as a whole, we're not all of the same opinion. What better place than Parliament and, most specifically, this committee, to have that discussion on the recognition of the state of Palestine?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8592287" data-originallang="en">It goes without saying that we hold in our hearts and in our minds the people of Israel who have, for generations, for millennia, faced hatred, anti-Semitism and horrendous loss of life. Israel is their homeland, safe haven and a place that we need to defend and protect. There's no question about it, but people take up space. What I learned on my very first trip to Israel was that people take up space. We have two peoples living on a small piece of land, and we need to find a way for the two of them to not just coexist but thrive together. The safety and security of Israel is dependent upon the safety and security of Palestine, and they go hand in hand. That means we believe in the two-state solution. That means you need two states to do it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8592288" data-originallang="en">The question for this committee, which we believe is well expressed in the motion, is to let us study that without presupposing. We read the motion differently, I understand that. I've heard the opposition. We read the motion differently. We are not presupposing the timing of the recognition, but we are presupposing the recognition, because we have presupposed the two-state solution. That's how we're reading it. We are committed to that. We want to work with this committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8592289" data-originallang="en">It will be an uncomfortable set of hearings. We'll have people bringing their pain, bringing their differences and bringing their anxieties, their worries and their fears on both sides or maybe more than two sides. That is what we need to do.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8592290" data-originallang="en">I want to close by saying that we are on the verge of this becoming a regional conflict, so we have to find a way to de-escalate. I speak particularly about the Israel-Lebanon border, south Lebanon and attacks that are taking place both in Israel from Hezbollah, a terrorist organization, and in Lebanon, which have killed civilians. That has to stop.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8592291" data-originallang="en"> We also recognize the role of Iran in this. We recognize that the Arab states are trying to find a way to broker peace. The United States is trying to do that. Canada is playing its role. The Palestinian Authority is attempting to play its role. We will continue to do that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8592292" data-originallang="en">I will close by saying that this is the place for us to have this discussion, and it shouldn't wait. That's why we will be supporting the motion and continuing to defend it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8592293" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
