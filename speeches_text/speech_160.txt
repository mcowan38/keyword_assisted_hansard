<p data-HoCid="6153277" data-originallang="en">On a point of order, as well, Chair, today the time has not been great at all. There have been lots of people going well over their time, between 30 seconds and a full minute, which limits my opportunity and the opportunity of my colleague MP Gazan to get in more questions. We know we are doing these virtually. We know we should be signing on a half-hour before, making sure our technology works in order to start on time and prevent any further delays. I think it's time that all of us, as committee members, decide we're going to take that extra step to make sure we're ready and we're prepared. We understand we're going to have these difficulties. I would never schedule something at 4 p.m., the same day I had a committee, because of these kinds of things, Chair. I think these are all things that we need to discuss in the future if it continues to be an issue. </p>
