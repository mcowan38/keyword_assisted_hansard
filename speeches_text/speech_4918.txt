<p data-HoCid="8576766" data-originallang="fr">Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that we rise this evening to discuss this topic, which is creating a lot of despair. I come from the Thetford Mines area, in the riding of Mégantic—L'Érable, where there are no large Jewish, Palestinian or Lebanese communities. However, there has never been so much talk about everything happening in the Middle East.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576767" data-originallang="fr">First of all, I must say that I very much appreciated the speech tonight by my colleague from <a data-HoCid="278408" href="/politicians/michael-chong/" title="Michael Chong">Wellington—Halton Hills</a>, our foreign affairs critic. I do not want to repeat his entire speech, but I invite Canadians and Quebeckers to take a few minutes to listen to it. He reminded us what it was like for Canadians who lived through the two great wars. Countries were forced to take up arms to defend themselves and, more importantly, their people against deadly attacks from authoritarian states.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576768" data-originallang="fr">As I said, I do not often get a chance to talk about the conflict. The conflict is not a simple one. Many of the constituents I meet ask me to explain what is really going on in Israel, Palestine, Lebanon and Iran, and what the roots of the conflict are. I do my best to answer their questions. It really is a lot more complex than it appears at first glance. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8576769" data-originallang="fr">A year or so ago, I could have provided the beginnings of an explanation about the situation in the Middle East, but on October 7, 2023, that explanation broke down. The horrors of October 7 will be etched in the memories of Jewish communities around the world for a long time, as well as international rights advocates and all those who are directly or indirectly interested in the rich history of the Middle East. It will be etched in my memory for a long time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576770" data-originallang="fr">On October 7, a liberal, democratic state came under attack. Israel was attacked by the terrorist group Hamas. Israel was invaded by 2,500 Hamas terrorists, who crossed a sovereign state border established in 1949 to kill more than 1,100 civilians. Over 1,100 people died. These poor people were not killed by accident or as collateral damage. They were systematically, deliberately targeted and murdered by the terrorist group Hamas. They were slaughtered. On October 7, entire families were executed, innocent babies and children were killed, together with mothers, fathers and young people. Imagine parents in Canada sending their children to a big festival attended by youth groups, where the only goal is to have fun and enjoy life. Now imagine the festival being targeted by a terrorist attack, and most of the participants being hunted down and killed by terrorists. Imagine the horror. In fact, it is impossible for us to imagine it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576771" data-originallang="fr">On top of that, some victims were paraded around the streets of Gaza. Their mutilated bodies were displayed like trophies at a parade. Canadians were among those who were deliberately murdered or taken hostage by Hamas. Some hostages are still being held captive a year later, those who have not already been killed by the terrorists, that is.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576772" data-originallang="fr">That is the origin of the war we are talking about and witnessing right now in the Middle East. It was a brutal terrorist attack on the sovereign land of Israel, and these terrorists are responsible for the situation we are in today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576773" data-originallang="fr">Unfortunately, other groups have decided to join Hamas. Ever since Hamas launched its attack against Israel on October 7, 2023, Hezbollah and the Islamic Republic of Iran have deliberately chosen to commit terrorist acts against the people of Israel. Since October 7, 2023, Hezbollah has launched some 8,000 rockets at Israel over the past 12 months, forcing the displacement of 60,000 people. These 8,000 missiles filled with explosives were fired for the purpose of killing civilians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576774" data-originallang="fr"> All states have a responsibility to defend their citizens and their territory, and the State of Israel is no different. Israel is at war. As my colleague from <a data-HoCid="278408" href="/politicians/michael-chong/" title="Michael Chong">Wellington—Halton Hills</a> said, and I quote: “This is a legal war under international humanitarian law. The war the State of Israel is conducting against Hamas, against Hezbollah and against the Islamic Republic of Iran under international humanitarian law is a justifiable war.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576775" data-originallang="fr">I agree with my colleague that war is never pretty, but it is sometimes justified. This war against terrorist groups and a regime that sponsors terrorism is justifiable. Israel has the right to defend itself against the 8,000 rockets that Hezbollah has fired into its territory over the past year. Israel has the right to defend itself against the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which launched hundreds of missiles into its territory just last night. Israel has the right to pursue this war against Hamas, Hezbollah and the Islamic Republic of Iran to protect itself and, above all, its citizens.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576776" data-originallang="fr">Imagine for a moment what would happen if Canada were attacked by terrorist groups. There is no doubt that all of us here would agree to defend our families and our children, and to use whatever means necessary to do so. That is what Israel is doing right now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576777" data-originallang="fr">However, we have to recognize that war is war. Millions of innocent civilians are suffering as a result of the war in Gaza, Lebanon, and Israel. Obviously, we mourn the loss of innocent civilians, especially women and children. All combatants in this conflict must be careful to distinguish between fighting forces and civilians. Every possible precaution must be taken to minimize the harm caused to civilians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576778" data-originallang="fr">To end this war, Hezbollah and Hamas must lay down their weapons to protect the innocent Lebanese and Palestinians who have been subjected to these brutal terrorist entities for decades. The citizens of Israel are not the only victims of these terrorist groups and regimes. Palestinians, Lebanese, Syrians and Iranians have been and continue to be victimized by Hamas, Hezbollah and the Islamic Republic of Iran regime.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576779" data-originallang="fr">Allow me once again to quote my colleague from Wellington—Halton Hills: “For too long, these regimes have suppressed democracy, human rights and freedoms, and the rule of law through brute force.... If there is any ray of hope in recent events, it is that they mark the end of the terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah, and the beginning of the end of the Islamic Republic of Iran's hold on much of the region.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576780" data-originallang="fr">I share my colleague's opinion and I wish from the bottom of my heart for these peoples to find a lasting peace, free from these authoritarian terrorist groups and regimes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576781" data-originallang="fr">In Canada, we value the freedom that our democracy affords us. It may not be perfect, but it safeguards our freedom and the rights of every citizen of this country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576782" data-originallang="fr">Unfortunately, what is happening in the Middle East is a battle between our liberal democracies and authoritarian states and groups, such as the People's Republic of China, which is baring its teeth at Taiwan, the Russian Federation and its illegal attacks on Ukraine, and the Islamic Republic of Iran, which supports terrorist groups against the State of Israel and which has just taken up arms against it. What do Taiwan, Ukraine and Israel have in common? They are democratic states, like us, that are being threatened and attacked by the authoritarian regimes I just mentioned.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576783" data-originallang="fr">Canada must defend democracy, human rights, freedoms and the rule of law as set out in international law. To end the war, the hostages must be released. Hamas must release the hostages. Hezbollah must stop its attacks on the people of Israel. However, more is needed. These terrorist organizations must be dismantled. They must cease to exist.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576784" data-originallang="fr">The Conservatives support the State of Israel. Israel has the right to defend itself and to use all of the legal means necessary under international humanitarian law to ensure its peace and security. Clearly, when there is a choice to be made between authoritarian and democratic states, Canada should have no trouble choosing what side we are on.</p>
