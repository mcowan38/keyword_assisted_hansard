<p data-HoCid="8372444" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372445" data-originallang="en">We have undertaken extensive engagement. There have been over 16 engagements in the different regions of the country, many of which were attended by MP Damoff, as well as MP Gazan. I participated in some of them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372446" data-originallang="en">There are a number of different critical partners who have been working for many years on the issue of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls and gender-diverse people, and they've informed us a great deal.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372447" data-originallang="en">The next step of this is where we need to start codeveloping the system along with our partners and to ensure that the system is responsive to the needs, because the last thing we want to do is create a system that is devoid of usage by those who are meant to use it, as well as those it's meant to support. It's critical that we get this right.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372448" data-originallang="en">I want to ask Krista Apse to shed a little more light on what the next steps are.</p>
