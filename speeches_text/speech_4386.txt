<p data-HoCid="8455517" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Ms. Bisla.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455518" data-originallang="fr">In your opinion, should all forms of hate be treated equally, or should more special consideration be given to antisemitism or Islamophobia, for example? Should specific treatment be reserved for these forms of hate, or should any hate speech or any form of hatred be dealt with in the same way?</p>
