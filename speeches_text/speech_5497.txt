<p data-HoCid="8723530" data-originallang="en">Yes, I can certainly elaborate. The motion I submitted on Monday, September 23, indicates:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8723531" data-originallang="en"> That, given that the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage regrets the continued protection given by the Minister of Canadian Heritage to the estimated 900 Nazis that were allowed to enter Canada after the Second World War by refusing to release their names and refusing to listen to organizations representing victims of the Nazis, the committee invite the Minister of Canadian Heritage to instruct Library and Archives Canada to release the names of the 900 Nazis before International Holocaust Remembrance Day on Monday, January 27, 2025, and that this motion be reported to the House. </p>
