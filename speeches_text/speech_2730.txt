<p data-HoCid="7959978" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I do not know if I am changing or the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> is, but this is second time this week I completely agree with everything she has said.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7959979" data-originallang="en">I genuinely appreciate her comments today, in particular about a basic income, but also about, more generally speaking, the food sharing program we absolutely need to bring into our schools throughout the country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7959980" data-originallang="en">I want to congratulate the member for <a data-HoCid="278155" href="/politicians/patricia-lattanzio/" title="Patricia Lattanzio">Saint-Léonard—Saint-Michel</a> for introducing this very important bill. Once again, we see Quebec, which has had this legislation in place for decades now, has led the way, like it quite often does on other issues socially, or the environment, for example.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7959981" data-originallang="en">This is critically important. It is important that our children, who are in the age of developing and whose minds are still developing, are not subject to a bombardment of detrimental and unhealthy choices at such a young age. I have two children under the age of 13, and I think of how easily they are influenced by what they are seeing. The forms of media have changed so much since I was a child. Nowadays children are watching much more YouTube and more custom and tailored shows. We are seeing these advertisements come across in a way I certainly was not exposed to. When I was younger, we would sit in front of a TV on Saturday morning to watch cartoons. These ads would pop up, and our parents could be kind of looking our shoulder to see what we were watching. It is much more difficult now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7959982" data-originallang="en">I also completely agree with the comments from the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> about this being a preventative step. This is about helping to prepare children so they can have the best shot at life in terms of health.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7959983" data-originallang="en">I am going to keep my comments very short. It is very refreshing to see the entire chamber support this initiative. The only thing I wish I could ask is that this be extended to grandparents too, because my mother, my children's grandmother, quite often purchases unhealthy stuff. Maybe that will be tackled at a later time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7959984" data-originallang="en">Congratulations to the member for <a data-HoCid="278155" href="/politicians/patricia-lattanzio/" title="Patricia Lattanzio">Saint-Léonard—Saint-Michel</a> for bringing this forward. This is a very important initiative, and I look forward to it making its way over to the Senate next and becoming law so we can move forward on this very important initiative.</p>
