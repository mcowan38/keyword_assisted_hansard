<p data-HoCid="8581768" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> for her work in bringing forward the bill that would recognize residential school denialism as a hate crime. I look forward to working with her.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8581769" data-originallang="en">We know that as we marked the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, it was a painful reminder that we need to do better to educate Canadians on the impacts of residential schools, as well as on the hurtful acts of denialism that take place in many parts of the country.</p>
