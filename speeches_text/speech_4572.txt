<p data-HoCid="8503283" data-originallang="en">I find it interesting, Mr. Muys, that you have an Israeli pin on. At the IATA conference I was just at, one of the airlines I talked to was El Al. They indicated that they have not returned to Canada postpandemic because they recognize that flying back to Canada is too costly for them. They do not have a direct link anymore.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8503284" data-originallang="en">I just want to address the concern about fee charges. When we talk about, for example, allowing airports to retain the $400 million more that they currently pay to the federal government, that's not essentially profiting airlines. That's allowing airports to keep the money they have to invest in infrastructure.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8503285" data-originallang="en">When we talk about the 29% increase in the air navigation fees or the 33% in the air security charge, those are fees that are directly passed on to the passenger. A reduction in those fees does not impact the profitability of an airline. Those are fees that would be directly reduced to the passenger.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8503286" data-originallang="en">There is an element that you heard from the northern carriers last week. Those fee charges do have a direct impact on their ability to do business in terms of affordability in particular. </p>
