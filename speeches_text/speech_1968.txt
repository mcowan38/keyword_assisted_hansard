<p data-HoCid="7414701" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Madam Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7414702" data-originallang="en">Mr. Singer, I found Mr. Waugh's comments somewhat insulting and inappropriate, and I'd like to apologize on behalf of the committee. He needs to be understanding, I think, more importantly the role that community newspapers play, including in his community, where he's got the Saskatchewan and Alberta weekly newspapers associations asking for legislation like this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7414703" data-originallang="en">I'd like to come back, Mr. Singer, to your comments about community news, because you are absolutely right to identify that one of the reasons why we're seeing the rise in hate in all of its toxic forms—more anti-Semitism, more racism, more homophobia and transphobia, more Islamophobia, more misogyny—is in part that those links that community journalists play, that community newspapers play, are being exploded as big tech tries to profit from hate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7414704" data-originallang="en">As you know, in the United States, a major campaign that involves a whole range of organizations fighting back against hate is Stop Hate for Profit. Could you re-emphasize the importance of having a community journalistic sector that helps to counteract how big tech has shamelessly exploited hate to pad its bottom line, so that there is some counterbalance and we can start to re-establish community links right across North America?</p>
