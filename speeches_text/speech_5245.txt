<p data-HoCid="8691851" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8691852" data-originallang="en"> What's happening here today, for the folks watching, is an unfolding of what we've seen repeatedly since the time I was elected, but I'm sure it's been like this longer than I've been here. It's a deflection of accountability. That's ultimately the big conversation that has to happen on a bigger scale.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8691853" data-originallang="en">It's ironic that you have Mr. Maloney, who sits on this committee, writing a tweet asking if the leader is gagging us. It is no secret to the public that there are 24 Liberal MPs who have signed a letter asking for the resignation of the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>.

<p data-HoCid="8691856" data-originallang="en"> Let's talk about that. Let's talk about the rise in anti-Semitism since <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Justin Trudeau</a> took office. Let's talk about sexual assaults, which are up 75% since Justin Trudeau took office. Let's talk about sexual violations against children, which are up 119% since Justin Trudeau took office. Let's talk about forcible confinement or kidnapping, which are up 11% since Justin Trudeau took office. Let's talk about indecent, harassing communications, which are up 86% since Justin Trudeau took office. Let's talk aboutâ€”</p>
