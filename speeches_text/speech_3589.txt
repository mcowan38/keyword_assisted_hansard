<p data-HoCid="8284557" data-originallang="en">Mr. Lévêque, the President of the United States has publicly referred to the intolerable levels “of extremist settler violence, forced displacement of people and villages, and property destruction” in the West Bank.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8284558" data-originallang="en">Our own <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> has announced that she would like to follow the United States' example on sanctions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8284559" data-originallang="en">Can you please update this committee on whether those sanctions are going ahead? What criteria and methods of investigation is the government using to identify extremist settlers and the violence being perpetrated on Palestinians in the West Bank?</p>
