<p data-HoCid="8679392" data-originallang="en"> It's vital. In 2002, after many decades of the Israeli government clamouring for the recognition of its neighbours in the Arab world and in the Muslim world, the Arab peace initiative was launched by the League of Arab States, holding out an offer of full recognition of the State of Israel if Israel were to withdraw, as it is legally required to do, from the whole of the occupied Palestinian territory. That was 22 years ago. That offer is still on the table. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679393" data-originallang="en">When Foreign Minister Safadi mentioned that just the other day, that was a big thing, because the moment that Israel withdraws, the Arab states and the Muslim states, all of them—these are over 51 states—will recognize Israel. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679394" data-originallang="en">They'll therefore have bilateral relations with Israel that require that they respect Israel's territorial integrity and political independence in Israel's borders. The key is that Israel is not Palestine. Israel has no sovereign rights or legal rights in occupied Palestine. That's the quid pro quo. Respect international law; we recognize you and will protect you.</p>
