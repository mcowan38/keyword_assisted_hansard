<p data-HoCid="8172949" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Ms. Gazan. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8172950" data-originallang="en">As chair I must rule on admissibility of amendments. My responsibility is to ensure that the procedure of the House of Commons that has been adopted by all parties is followed. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8172951" data-originallang="en">Before I give a ruling on the amendment moved by Ms. Gazan, I'm going to ask whichever official feels it is appropriate to speak briefly to the issue. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8172952" data-originallang="en">Does Bill <a data-HoCid="12260777" href="/bills/44-1/C-318/" title="An Act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and the Canada Labour Code (adoptive and intended parents)">C-318</a> infringe on Bill <a data-HoCid="11007812" href="/bills/43-2/C-15/" title="An Act respecting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">C-15</a>? You heard the concern outlined by Ms. Gazan. Could you briefly address that before...?</p>
