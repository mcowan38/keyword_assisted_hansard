<p data-HoCid="7924325" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, tomorrow evening Carleton University's journalism program will launch a new scholarship in honour of Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Akleh.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7924326" data-originallang="en">Carleton is the first university outside of the Middle East to recognize her in this way by creating the Shireen Abu Akleh Emerging Reporter Award in Social Justice Journalism. The award will grant $5,000 each year to a Carleton journalism student to undertake a social justice reporting project. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7924327" data-originallang="en">Shireen's brother Tony Abu Akleh has travelled to Ottawa to take part in a special tribute concert being held tomorrow evening in the Carleton Dominion-Chalmers Centre.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7924328" data-originallang="en">Shireen was a trailblazer, among the first female journalists in the Arab world to be seen on TV as a war correspondent, complete with a flak jacket and helmet. We pay tribute to the remarkable legacy of Shireen Abu Akleh, a role model for generations.</p>
