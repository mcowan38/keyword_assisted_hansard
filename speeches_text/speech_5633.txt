<p data-HoCid="8759684" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8759685" data-originallang="en"> Minister, last Friday night, as Canada's second-largest city burned and was under siege by pro-Hamas terrorists rioting in the streets, damaging property and inciting their vile messaging of the extermination of the Jewish state, all the while, your leader, <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Justin Trudeau</a>, danced away at a Taylor Swift concert and shared friendship bracelets with other fans. You, as Canada's chief legal officer, remained silent.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8759686" data-originallang="en">Why, sir, did you display a lack of leadership and courage in calling out this extreme anti-Semitic hate and violence? </p>
