<p data-HoCid="7477302" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, a year ago, the advisory panel on systemic discrimination in the military recommended excluding clergy of the three Abrahamic religions from being chaplains. It said:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7477303" data-originallang="en"> Defence...cannot consider itself supportive of inclusivity when it employs as chaplains members of organizations whose values are not consistent with National Defence's ethics.... </p>
<p data-HoCid="7477304" data-originallang="en"> For example, some churches [exclude] women from their priesthoods...[and] certain faiths have strict tenets requiring conversion.... </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7477305" data-originallang="en">This recommendation is anti-Muslim, anti-Catholic and anti-Jewish. Has the government definitively rejected it?</p>
