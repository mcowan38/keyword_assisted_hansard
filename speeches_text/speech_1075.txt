<p data-HoCid="6772242" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Madame Gazan. I will note that I had those Order Paper questions distributed to all committee members in both official languages a number of weeks ago already. They should be in your inbox. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6772243" data-originallang="en">Do you know what? I didn't actually expect our committee to be disrupted in this way, but I really am trying to get answers on the rapid housing initiative, and when I get black pages from the government, that doesn't sit well with me as a parliamentarian who's responsible for fighting on behalf of my constituents, many of whom are indigenous and many of whom were upset with this program and the approach. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6772244" data-originallang="en">Furthermore, when I'm hearing from people like the mayor of Burnaby, chair of the Metro Vancouver housing committee, that there are some big problems, I have a responsibility to push for more information.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6772245" data-originallang="en">Sunshine is always the best medicine. I think there's an easy way around this, noting Mr. Vaughan's concerns around proprietary information. I understand that. That's why I was open to a friendly amendment, but he doesn't want to be accountable in a way that exposes his decision-making to the people of Canada. I understand that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6772246" data-originallang="en">That's the last comment I'm going to make on this today. Really, I didn't think it would come to this today, but my point is that transparency is always better than black pages.</p>
