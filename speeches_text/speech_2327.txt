<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, the member very often raises the issue of EI, and I want to thank her for that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">My colleague from <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>, earlier today, raised the point that the supposed feminist government is not really looking after the issues of women. We know that, when EI was first formulated, the participation rate of women in the workforce was less than half of what it is today. The EI system was not built for women.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Can the member share some comments on why it is so important to get this modernized for women after seven years?</p>
