<p data-HoCid="7673372" data-originallang="en">Education and Sharing Day is a day established in honour of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, recognizing his lifelong efforts towards improving education. He was an advocate for children and spoke out about the need for each child to be given an education that would offer them the opportunities to succeed. He often spoke about the need for education to focus not only on academic achievements but also on character building.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7673373" data-originallang="en">The rabbi's emissaries established a network of several thousand Jewish schools and education centres around the globe. They sought to empower young people and inspire individuals of all ages. A high-quality education develops the mind, opens the heart, nurtures our talents and fortifies our character. We owe a tremendous debt to Rabbi Schneerson and to all those who promote education that embraces moral and ethical values.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7673374" data-originallang="en">This year, let us rededicate ourselves to teaching the love of learning that was championed by Rabbi Schneerson.</p>
