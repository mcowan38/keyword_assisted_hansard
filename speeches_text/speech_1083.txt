Since he clearly does not want to answer that question, I will move on to another topic, that of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6756630" data-originallang="fr">I think that, like us, peace-loving Palestinians and Israelis are fed up with empty words and want action. Without giving away any caucus secrets, we know that the current minister's predecessor was asked to play the role of mediator, even before the most recent clashes occurred.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6756631" data-originallang="fr">What is happening with that? What role is Canada being called upon to play and is it prepared to play that role to bring the parties together so that lasting peace can be achieved in the region?</p>
