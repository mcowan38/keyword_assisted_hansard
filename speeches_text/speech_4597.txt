<p data-HoCid="8462923" data-originallang="fr">Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for her speech, although it feels as though she had to stick to a script today. She was repeating talking points. Personally, I am very concerned about the Liberals' lack of transparency on this issue. The NDP is worried. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8462924" data-originallang="fr">On the subject of transparency, in March she voted in favour of the NDP motion on the crisis and genocide taking place in Gaza. Among other things, the motion called for an embargo on arms sales to Israel and the Netanyahu government while it is bombing Gaza. The <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="MÃ©lanie Joly">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> has not issued a notice to Canadian arms exporters about their continuing to sell weapons to Netanyahu's genocidal regime.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8462925" data-originallang="fr">In the interests of transparency, how can my colleague explain her government's inaction when she voted for this motion?</p>
