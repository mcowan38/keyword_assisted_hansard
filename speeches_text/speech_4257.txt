<p data-HoCid="8435048" data-originallang="en">There are universities in the United States that have shown great leadership by adopting the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism. I think the better example to look at, though, is actually the United Kingdom, where the vast majority of educational institutions in the United Kingdom, including world-leading institutions like Oxford, Cambridge and Durham, have all adopted the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism. We need Canadian universities to follow the lead of these American, British and German institutions and to adopt the IHRA definition.</p>
