<p data-HoCid="8576662" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, as I said, Canadian citizens should leave Lebanon now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576663" data-originallang="en">I can offer solutions to what the government could and should have done since October 7. It should have listed, six years ago, the IRGC as the terrorist group that it is. It should ensure that every single one of those terrorists is sent out of this country. We know there are 700 here who still roam around in our communities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576664" data-originallang="en"> After the incursions into Israel today, at no time in history has it been more important to show Iranian Canadians and those fighting in the streets for freedom in Lebanon that they are on the side of freedom against tyranny. There is no time in history when the government should have taken this more seriously.</p>
