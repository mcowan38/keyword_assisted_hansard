<p data-HoCid="8019355" data-originallang="en">I can answer, because it's a little bit of a political question rather than a legal one. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8019356" data-originallang="en">I believe that pain is the same everywhere. That's why we have sympathy for those civilians and children who are suffering because of other wars. At the same time, I strongly believe this is very dangerous for Ukraine and Ukrainian society, because without military aid and without financial aid, Ukraine will not have the capability to continue to defend itself and its own society. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8019357" data-originallang="en">You may know how many people are fighting now—we have an army with one million soldiers—but without military aid, this army will not have tools and equipment for not just counterattacks and campaigning but for protecting what we have already liberated, because Russia is in the stage of starting their bigger counterattack. Without fighter jets, without equipment that will be helpful for protecting those territories that are already liberated and for continuing counteroffensive attacks on the southern part of Ukraine, first of all, Ukraine will not save itself and its own society.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8019358" data-originallang="en">When the Ukrainian army liberated the territories not only in Kyiv but also in Kharkiv and in the southern part of Ukraine, we saw how many victims we had there without any access to the information on the ground.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8019359" data-originallang="en"> That story about mass graves and tortured people who had any type of connection with the Ukrainian government or were related to the pro-Ukrainian position.... They were in danger. That's why military and financial aid is the main topic for us. It's about how to save and protect the people, how to stop this full-scale invasion on the ground and how to protect what we have already liberated.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8019360" data-originallang="en">I hope Canada will continue to support us. I just got back from D.C. a few days ago, where we had an advocacy mission. We tried to make people aware of why it's so important. We believe that Israel, Palestine and Ukraine do not have to be on the same page with regard to attention, but our sustainable and capable partners have to focus on both conflicts if they wish to support a world without war.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8019361" data-originallang="en">I'm sorry for this political statement, but it's about the suffering of civilians and protecting the children and people in need, for now. Please continue to support Ukraine. Please don't refocus from one topic to another, because all people are important, for sure. Ukraine is not just about news; Ukraine is about the ongoing war, and this war will end. The battle will end. </p>
