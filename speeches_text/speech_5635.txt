<p data-HoCid="8759801" data-originallang="fr"> First of all, with respect to my first response to Mr. Brock, I'd like to say that I take the demonstration of anti-Semitism in Montreal very seriously. I've spoken in the House and I'll say it again today: What we saw in Montreal is absolutely unacceptable.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8759802" data-originallang="fr">With respect to your question, I would point out that, over the past 40 years, one law at a time, we had to find a compromise regarding the language used to show that we weren't going to derogate from the indigenous rights protected by the Canadian Constitution. What changes with Bill <a data-HoCid="12509752" href="/bills/44-1/S-13/" title="An Act to amend the Interpretation Act and to make related amendments to other Acts">Sâ€‘13</a> is that we are proposing an amendment to the Interpretation Act that will have a broader application and affect any bill and any statute adopted by the federal government.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8759803" data-originallang="fr">That will help us in terms of the effectiveness and consistency of the language we use, because we have observed an inconsistency in that regard over the past 40 years. The language used in a bill 15 years ago is not the same as the language used, for example, 15 months ago.</p>
