<p data-HoCid="7956637" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, we want to reiterate that the Bloc Québécois strongly and unequivocally condemns the Hamas terrorist attacks. We reiterate that Israel has a right to defend itself against Hamas.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7956638" data-originallang="fr">However, we need to distinguish between Hamas and the people of Gaza and Palestine. As early as last Tuesday, the UN was calling for a humanitarian corridor into Gaza for medical reasons. That is the very basis of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons, which states in article 3, and I quote, “The wounded and sick shall be collected and cared for.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="7956639" data-originallang="fr">What concrete efforts is Canada making to obtain such assurances from Israel?</p>
