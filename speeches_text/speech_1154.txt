<p data-HoCid="6791834" data-originallang="en">On the UN resolutions, we have been voting pretty much in the same way for a number of years. That is predicated on the view that there are far too many one-sided resolutions that unfairly single out Israel. Each year at the United Nations you will have 19 to 23 resolutions—depending upon the year—all of which make all kinds of commentary on Israeli behaviour, but there's no discussion of other players in those resolutions, for the most part. I think that's one of the reasons we have voted fairly consistently. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6791835" data-originallang="en">I would note that we did have a vote change on the self-determination resolution that took place in 2018, to send a message that we very strongly support the two-state solution and a comprehensive, just and lasting peace. That's on voting.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791836" data-originallang="en">On the negotiations of a broader Middle East peace, Canada has been very active for many years on this and very active in the past several years, as well. The former U.S. administration put a lot of effort into it, with U.S. President Trump's so-called “deal of the century”. We went to the economic part of their plan to see where it was headed. One of the key problems with that plan was that it fell far below the international consensus. All the red lines related to the final status issues. There have been efforts for encouraging Middle East peace. They've just been fairly unsuccessful and unrealistic.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791837" data-originallang="en">Moving forward, I think we really need to work together collectively to prevent these kinds of conflicts from occurring. We will do our part. We are very significant in supporting the diplomatic part of that peace and the humanitarian and development part of that peace. We very regularly work with our colleagues in the new U.S. administration, with the U.K., the EU and our partners in the region to try to get it on track.</p>
