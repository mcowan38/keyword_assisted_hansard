<p data-HoCid="8576567" data-originallang="en">I also want to acknowledge that Jewish people, Palestinian people, Muslims and Arabs across this country have faced incredible racism and discrimination. Even within the House, the member has been a victim of discrimination and of horrific hate speech, in my opinion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576568" data-originallang="en">I want to give the member my sympathy and express my support for her.</p>
