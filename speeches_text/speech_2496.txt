<p data-HoCid="7882333" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I am certain the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> was not referring to my colleagues as goons. I am sure she has more respect for her fellow members in the House than that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7882334" data-originallang="en">The member and her party are the ones in the coalition with the government of big business, the government that gave money to Loblaws, for example. I think that before she accuses the official opposition of such acts, she should really take a look at who she is in bed with first.</p>
