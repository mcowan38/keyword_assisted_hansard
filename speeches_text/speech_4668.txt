<p data-HoCid="8520220" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8520221" data-originallang="en">Mr. Dolhai, I want to congratulate you on your nomination.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8520222" data-originallang="en"> I heard a lot of what you were saying earlier in response to some of the members who have already asked questions. The committee is currently concluding its study on the rise of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia in Canada. We all know that the outcomes have been incredibly painful.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8520223" data-originallang="en">Can you please comment on the low levels of successful prosecutions for hate crimes? Is this a problem with the laws Canada currently has, or are there other causes impeding successful prosecutions?</p>
