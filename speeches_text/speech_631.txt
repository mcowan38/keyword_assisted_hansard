<p data-HoCid="6496943" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6496944" data-originallang="en">I do believe that we should have debate, but it's very hard for me to debate something that I am not a part of. I have read what UNRWA has said with respect to this, and I simply have decided that I think we need to take that for what they say—so I'd be supportive of Ms. McPherson's amendment—and then continue to work with UNRWA to ensure it never happens again.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6496945" data-originallang="en"> Absolutely, we want to ensure that there are appropriate educational materials, that we do not tolerate anti-Semitism in any fashion, and that we expect all the materials that Canadian dollars are being spent on to uphold that as well. I think that adding “in error” does not diminish that whatsoever; it simply acknowledges what UNRWA has told us. I think we need to keep pushing UNRWA always to ensure they're doing their work in the way that we and our international partners want them to do it, but I don't think it serves anybody to not take them at their word for what they're saying.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6496946" data-originallang="en"> That's why I will be in support of the subamendment and then the amendment.</p>
