<p data-HoCid="8396400" data-originallang="en">Yes, but the UN report's criticism of how the World Food Programme is operated in Gaza is that it's not operating under its own auspices there. It has to operate under UNRWA rather than under the World Food Programme. Their recommendation was that UN agencies be able to go directly into Gaza without having to seek intercession through UNRWA. </p>
