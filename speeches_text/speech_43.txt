<p data-HoCid="6040960" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, my constituents in York Centre regularly share with me their deep concerns about the BDS movement and the alarming rise of anti-Semitism in Canada and around the world. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6040961" data-originallang="en">Last month, as part of the Governor General's delegation to the World Holocaust Forum in Israel and the Auschwitz commemoration in Poland, I had the opportunity to reaffirm Canada's strong resolve to fight anti-Semitism, including by formally adopting the IHRA definition.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6040962" data-originallang="en">With this in mind, can the <a data-HoCid="253367" href="/politicians/francois-philippe-champagne/" title="FranÃ§ois-Philippe Champagne">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> reiterate Canada's position on BDS?</p>
