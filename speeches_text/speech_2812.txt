<p data-HoCid="7988474" data-originallang="en"> On the assistance from Canadians, we are aware that individual Canadians have been making contributions through the Red Cross and through others that have appealed. We know that in the Jewish stakeholder community in Canada, a variety of different appeals have moved forward. I saw a report this morning that there's $100 million in assistance that has been gathered by Canadians who feel an affinity with Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988475" data-originallang="en">Individual Canadians are making those determinations and beginning to step forward. The question of the matching funds has not been broached at this point, but certainly Canada has been front and centre in terms of government-level contributions to make sure that the assistance gets to those who need it most, especially in Gaza.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988476" data-originallang="en">The longer-term question you raise about livelihoods is one that in the Palestinian territories we've been deeply engaged in. We do work with trusted partners on livelihoods, including for women in particular. We have been deeply engaged in that. I envisage that we will continue to be engaged in that. We have a very good baseline of development support that Canada provides to Palestinians each year. It is $55 million, which is the envelope we typically work with each year.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988477" data-originallang="en">Apart from this immediate crisis and the immediate catastrophe that we're trying to deal with right now, we do have a longer-term commitment to working with the Palestinian people, including on questions related to livelihood and economic opportunity.</p>
