<p data-HoCid="8284441" data-originallang="en">I would like to touch upon the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">minister</a>'s recent trip to Israel, the West Bank and the region. I took note of a number of tweets and social media posts about some of the accomplishments of the minister's trip. They included two announcements, both related to protecting the rights of women from sexual and gender-based violence. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8284442" data-originallang="en">The first tweet I saw said that Canada was giving $1 million to support the victims of sexual-based violence on October 7. That tweet was very clear about Hamas being the aggressors.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8284443" data-originallang="en">A second tweet I read said that Canada was giving $1 million to support Palestinian women who were the victims of sexual and gender-based violence, but it was unclear who the alleged party committing these crimes actually was and where the money was going in each of the two $1-million tranches. </p>
