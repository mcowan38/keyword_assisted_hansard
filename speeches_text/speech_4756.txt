<p data-HoCid="8574373" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8574374" data-originallang="en">I'll move it momentarily. I just recall that when I was on this committee last, we were able to work together. Despite not agreeing on a lot, we were able to get a lot of work done. Therefore, in an effort to do that, I would like to move a subamendment to Ms. O'Connell.... Again, given that we didn't have notice of the amendment, I'll do the best I can to make it make sense.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8574375" data-originallang="en">I'll just read hers, and then I'll give it my best shot:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8574376" data-originallang="en"> Given that the RCMP have arrested an additional alleged ISIS terrorist, who was preparing to carry out a massacre targeting the Jewish community in New York City, the committee expand its Review of the Foiled Terrorist Plot in Toronto and of the Security Screening Process for Permanent Residence and Citizenship Application to include questions around this more recent arrest in its meetings, and invite both the Minister of Public Safety and the Minister of Immigration to return for two hours respectively with officials, once the investigative findings have progressed. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8574377" data-originallang="en"> I think that may be the best open-ended word, sir.</p>
