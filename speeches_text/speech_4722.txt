<p data-HoCid="8488812" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I am rising to offer some very brief comments in response to the question of privilege raised by the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> on June 6.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8488813" data-originallang="en"> There is a tradition in this House that when a member apologizes, the House accepts this apology, whether people feel it is sincere or not, and the member for <a data-HoCid="278683" href="/politicians/brad-redekopp/" title="Brad Redekopp">Saskatoon West</a> has apologized. What I believe to be unresolved on the issue is the inappropriate changing of Hansard to try to erase what the member for Saskatoon West said from the official record. There is an old saying that the cover-up was worse than the crime, and I believe that the change made in Hansard by the member is completely inappropriate and goes beyond the scope of permitted changes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8488814" data-originallang="en"> <em>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</em>, third edition, on page 1228, states, “Members may suggest corrections to errors and minor alterations to the transcription but may not make material changes to the meaning of what was said in the House.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8488815" data-originallang="en">The change that the member for <a data-HoCid="278683" href="/politicians/brad-redekopp/" title="Brad Redekopp">Saskatoon West</a> made to the blues goes entirely against this practice. The edit made material change to the meaning of what the member said. While it was appropriate for the member to apologize, it was not appropriate for him to try to cover up what he said. I ask that the Speaker consider this point.</p>
