<p data-HoCid="8003798" data-originallang="en">The amendment, which has now been amended and then subamended, that is before this committee has to do with the CBC. Mr. Julian then added “Meta and Google”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8003799" data-originallang="en"> The intent of the subamendment being discussed would be that Ms. Tait, the head of the CBC, would be brought forward to this committee, and she would be given opportunity to answer for decisions she has made.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8003800" data-originallang="en">Further to that, there would be a desire to hear from Mr. Achi, who is responsible for journalistic standards and who instructed those at the CBC not to use the word “terrorist” when referring to Hamas, which is a terrorist organization.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8003801" data-originallang="en">Further to that, there is also a desire to hear from Mr. Nagler, who is also a part of the leadership team at the CBC. He serves as the ombudsman.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8003802" data-originallang="en">Of course, these three combined would hopefully be able to offer this committee some answers as to why they're making the decisions they are making.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8003803" data-originallang="en">What I find alarming is that the CBC is spreading dangerous disinformation, promoted by Hamas, and they put it out there as if it's fact. Just a week ago, they said that the Gaza hospital was bombed by Israel and that hundreds were dead. In fact, we now have intelligence from Canada's national defence and intelligence command, and we also have verification from the United States, France and the United Kingdom, saying that is false. Yet, the CBC has not offered an apology for their spreading of dangerous disinformation, dangerous disinformation that actually feeds into anti-Semitic beliefs and behaviour in this country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8003804" data-originallang="en">When taxpayers are putting $1.4 billion toward a machine that is spreading disinformation, that's wrong.</p>
