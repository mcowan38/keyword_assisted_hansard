<p data-HoCid="8479420" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479421" data-originallang="en">I want to start by expressing my condolences to the families that have lost loved ones. I thank the witnesses—and I agree with the chair—for the bravery of being here today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479422" data-originallang="en">I know that all members of the committee will want to know of any consequences of your appearance today. I heard from one of the witnesses who appeared in our anti-Semitism study of an attempt to retaliate for their appearance at the committee, and we will be taking measures to make sure that we follow up on that. We care very much and will be very vigilant about any attempts to intimidate people who appear before our committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479423" data-originallang="en">Your powerful testimony today illustrates what I hoped we would achieve. When we started with the idea of studying anti-Semitism, I believed we should also study Islamophobia, not necessarily because they always go hand in hand, but because these are two of the most virulent forms of hatred presently in our society.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479424" data-originallang="en">What you have said to us today about the loss of a sense of belonging and the loss of a sense of safety is very powerful and is something that Parliament really must address. I want to ask Mr. Nalir from the Toronto Islamic Centre and Community Services what he feels has been most effective in helping restore a sense of security, if that's been possible, and what would be most helpful in trying to restore a sense of security to the members of his mosque.</p>
