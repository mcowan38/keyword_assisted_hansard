<p data-HoCid="7265001" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much. I'd like to thank our witnesses for joining us here today. As I often start, please feel free to follow up with specific recommendations. Certainly, that is valuable when it comes time for this committee to put together its report.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7265002" data-originallang="en">I appreciate the content of your opening statements. One big challenge that I think lawmakers and public policy-makers have in terms of addressing this issue is trying to find that right balance. There's law enforcement that says it needs every tool available to help fight crime, to help protect victims, etc. On the other side we have the valid argument that we need to ensure that vulnerable people, groups, are protected and that the rights of Canadians, in the case of Canada, are respected.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7265003" data-originallang="en">I'd ask this question to both of you. Do you have any recommendations for this committee as to how to find that right balance? I'll start with Mr. Israel.</p>
