<p data-HoCid="8451127" data-originallang="en">Well, we are certainly waiting for that, and with that in mind, I will use my time to move a motion that we've already sent in to the committee. It is that:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8451128" data-originallang="en"> Pursuant to Standing Order 108(2), the committee invite the Minister of Diversity, Inclusion and Persons with Disabilities to appear for a period of two hours before June 19, 2024, to answer questions related to its anti-racism strategy, particularly due to the increase of both anti-Palestinian racism and anti-Semitism since October 7, 2024, and because the current anti-racism strategy has no definition or even reference to anti-Palestinian racism. </p>
