<p data-HoCid="6791810" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Lulashnyk. You answered my question very well.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791811" data-originallang="fr">I want to come back to the issue of the elections in Palestine. I was surprised to see the Government of Canada speak out publicly and in some respects admonish the Palestinian Authority for suspending the elections. I have two concerns in this regard.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791812" data-originallang="fr">The first is the situation in East Jerusalem. As you know, Israel prohibits the Palestinian population in East Jerusalem from participating in elections on the Palestinian side. Nor are they allowed to participate in elections on the Israeli side. This was one of the reasons given by the Palestinian Authority for suspending the elections.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791813" data-originallang="fr">My second concern is about the vaccination situation on the Palestinian side, which is not very advanced, which means the pandemic is still virulent on the Palestinian side.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791814" data-originallang="fr">Can we not understand the motives that led the Palestinian Authority to suspend the electoral process?</p>
