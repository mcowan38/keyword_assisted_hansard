<p data-HoCid="7146008" data-originallang="en">The question was if we can draw a parallel between what happened in Rwanda and what's happened in Ukraine. I look at it this way: I don't think we need to draw those parallels with either what happened in Rwanda or what happened in the Second World War, with the Holocaust, for instance, because that's something people tend to do.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7146009" data-originallang="en">As Mr. Stewart said, genocide leans a lot on the intent element of it, the intent to destroy a group in whole or in part. A reference to the Rwanda tribunal was made. The case law jurisprudence of the Rwandan court actually, when you analyze it, tells you that you do not need to kill a lot of people to have a genocide if that intent to destroy a group in whole or in part is there, an intent to destroy an ethnic group, racial group, religious group or a national group in whole or in part. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7146010" data-originallang="en">Mr. Czolij in his summation discussed five acts of genocide. I will repeat them: killing people, inflicting mental harm and bodily harm on people, depriving births within a group, and imposing upon people conditions of life calculated to bring about a destruction of that group in whole or in part.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7146011" data-originallang="en">If any of those five acts is identified with intent to destroy a group in whole or in part, you don't need to have 800,000 people killed as happened in Rwanda or six million as in the Holocaust to have a genocide.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7146012" data-originallang="en">I thought I should chip in there. Thank you.</p>
