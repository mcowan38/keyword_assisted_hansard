<p data-HoCid="6034795" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, this government is bragging about Canada's reputation on the world stage but is refusing to condemn Trump's new Middle East policy, which will legitimize the illegal occupation of Palestinian territories, exacerbate tensions and complicate a peaceful solution. Rather than denouncing the plan, the Liberals want to study it. There is nothing to study. This plan will not help the two parties negotiate lasting peace or put an end to the injustices faced by Palestinians.</p>
