<p data-HoCid="8564510" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I invite the member for <a data-HoCid="278569" href="/politicians/ziad-aboultaif/" title="Ziad Aboultaif">Edmonton Manning</a> to come into the House and say it. I do not read his Twitter feed. Who does? Not many do, but I know they read mine.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8564511" data-originallang="en">This shows the lack of seriousness about a horrific humanitarian disaster, the genocide happening in Gaza, with people dying, the targeting of medical doctors, the targeting of civilians and the targeting of journalists. This is something we in the House would deal with, but what we have learned from the <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">Leader of the Opposition</a> is that he has no interest in standing on the international stage. He ridicules the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> for staying at an expensive hotel. Well, he is the leader of a G7 country. I guess the Super 8 was booked the weekend he went to London. The Leader of the Opposition has to show a vision, but he does not have a vision; he has division. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8564512" data-originallang="en">The opposition could have brought in a motion today on the crisis we are facing in our medical system, but the <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">Leader of the Opposition</a> has no vision on that; he has bumper sticker slogans. His great favourite words are “radical” and “extremist”, and he is now saying that providing diabetes medication to people who need it is a radical idea. No, that is just plain human decency. That is what we should doing in Canada, but decency is not part of this leader's mantra.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8564513" data-originallang="en">What we have is a Conservative leader who has taken the fears and uncertainties of Canadians and pushed them down into dumbed-down slogans, which he has insisted that every member on his team repeat. I have been 20 years in the House and have never seen so many members reduced to caricature rhyming schemes. It is like a toxic Dr. Seuss, and the Conservatives repeat them again and again: “I don't like green eggs and ham. I don't like them, Sam-I-am. I don't like the carbon tax.” That is not leadership.</p>
