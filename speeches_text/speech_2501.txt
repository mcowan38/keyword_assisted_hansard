<p data-HoCid="7937227" data-originallang="en">First of all, I think it would be important to have that. We do have a subcommittee, and I do think there is a role for the subcommittee here that is supposed to be helping us as we set our calendar. We do have four studies that we are supposed to be undertaking, including Iran, as well as Israel and Palestine.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7937228" data-originallang="en"> More importantly, from my perspective, today we started 15 minutes late. I think we have too much work to do for that to become a habit. We could probably make an effort to start on time. I know that many folks maybe didn't make it in on time, and today is a Monday and a busy day, but when we start 20 minutes late, it's not fair to our witnesses and it's not fair to those of us who are on time.</p>
