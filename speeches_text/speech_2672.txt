<p data-HoCid="7957841" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the member for Calgary Heritage spoke about difficult times in the months and weeks ahead. I want to share some of the words of a critical care physician in Gaza right now. These words are, “The situation is catastrophic”. The hospital he works in is currently powered by a generator, having lost electricity for the past five days. He says, “Once the fuel inside the hospital vanishes, we will face a bad situation. We will turn into a big mortuary, a big grave.”</p>
