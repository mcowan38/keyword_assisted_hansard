<p data-HoCid="8172973" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8172974" data-originallang="en">I want to thank my colleague Ms. Falk for bringing this private member's bill forward, because equity is really what this comes down to. That's what this bill is all about. A parent is a parent, and a caregiver. It's a critical bill and it's something to be extremely proud of.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8172975" data-originallang="en">In relation to Ms. Gazan's amendment and what she's brought forth, I can't stress enough how vital this is. We worked together on Bill <a data-HoCid="12138647" href="/bills/44-1/C-35/" title="An Act respecting early learning and child care in Canada">C-35</a>, which is the child care bill, and we've worked together on the status of women. When this was put forward in Bill <a data-HoCid="12138647" href="/bills/44-1/C-35/" title="An Act respecting early learning and child care in Canada">C-35</a> to support the rights of Indigenous parents, the Liberals voted against it. We saw this again, and it just doesn't make sense.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8172976" data-originallang="en">I sense her frustration greatly today. I can feel it from her. I think that if we want to have a great country, we have to have healthy kids, and kids need to be cared for. This is a no-brainer amendment, and quite frankly, I'm shocked, especially when the person who has put forward the bill says that yes, this is well within the scope of what she had hoped for.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8172977" data-originallang="en">I fully support my colleague Ms. Gazan today, and I would deeply encourage.... We see article after article come forward in the news about this marketing slogan of $10-a-day child care crumbling in each province because the Liberal government did exactly what we said they would do: They set the provinces up to fail. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8172978" data-originallang="en">Do you know who's losing? It's children. </p>
