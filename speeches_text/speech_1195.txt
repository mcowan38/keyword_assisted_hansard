<p data-HoCid="6813915" data-originallang="en">Thanks, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6813916" data-originallang="en">I'm hoping we can deal with this quite quickly. I want to see if we can get unanimous consent for something. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6813917" data-originallang="en">Yesterday all parties in the House came together to condemn the attack on a Muslim family in London, Ontario, which killed three generations of one family. Last night leaders of all the parties were in my hometown of London to attend a vigil in their memory. They all spoke about working together and putting partisanship aside to deal with the issue of Islamophobia and hate. I'm trusting that we can do that today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6813918" data-originallang="en">On May 5 we passed a motion to study ideologically motivated violent extremism. We've completed two meetings thus far. I have a motion, which I would ask for unanimous consent to deal with today, that would see us continue our study next week, on Monday, and add an extra day on Wednesday. I think it would be important for us to hear from the National Council of Canadian Muslims to talk about the rise of Islamophobia, as well as the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs to talk about the rise in anti-Semitism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6813919" data-originallang="en">Chair, the clerk should have the motion in both official languages. It reads as follows: That, pursuant to the motion passed on May 5, 2001, the public safety committee continue its study on ideologically motivated violent extremism; that the meetings occur on June 14 and June 16, 2021; and that the committee invite the National Council of Canadian Muslims and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs to appear as witnesses on June 16. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6813920" data-originallang="en">I'm hoping we can get unanimous consent for that and pass it quite quickly, Chair.</p>
