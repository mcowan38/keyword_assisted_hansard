<p data-HoCid="6286958" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6286959" data-originallang="en">In substance, I agree with the motion to study the strategy. I have to reiterate, though, what Ms. Gazan just said.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6286960" data-originallang="en">Of the first two things we adopted today, one was to readopt all the things we had already adopted and we'd already looked at, and the second one was to prioritize one study that we'd already adopted. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6286961" data-originallang="en">This is an entirely new study, and I really would like to be able to read all the language of it. I may want to, for example, amend the timing of the meetings, so I'm wondering if, for the new studies—again, it's totally up to you, Brad—we could agree that, if we all get a copy of it, we'd vote on this at the next meeting. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6286962" data-originallang="en">I know Louise has studies, and the same would be true; if she could send us copies of them and we could vote on them all at the next meeting, that would be really helpful so that we understand it, and, if we have amendments, we could talk to you about them before the meeting and try to agree on them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6286963" data-originallang="en">It's just really hard. With all those paragraphs, I don't really remember in my head exactly where everything was.</p>
