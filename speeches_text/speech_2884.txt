<p data-HoCid="7971379" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the humanitarian situation in Gaza is getting worse by the minute. This collective punishment has now claimed the lives of over 6,000 people. The 12-year-old daughter of one of my constituents remains stuck in Gaza, separated from both of her parents, and we have no information on her whereabouts.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7971380" data-originallang="en">We need more humanitarian aid and a response that is fair to both Israeli and Palestinian civilians. When will the government join New Democrats in calling for a ceasefire now?</p>
