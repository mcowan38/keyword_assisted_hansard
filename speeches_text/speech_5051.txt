<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">You made the comment about striking nuclear sites—and we're talking about weapons sites in Iran. You said that it's in violation of the Geneva Convention. I just want to read to you article 56, as it is in Canadian law on the Geneva Convention. It says: “Works or installations containing dangerous forces, namely dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, shall not be made the object of attack.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">I know <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">Mr. Poilievre</a> was not talking about electrical sites like nuclear power stations; he was talking about nuclear weapons development sites that are happening right now in Iran. Do you not agree that those sites are fair game for Israel to retaliate against the regime in Tehran, yes or no? </p>
