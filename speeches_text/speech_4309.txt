<p data-HoCid="8412338" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412339" data-originallang="en">All I was going to say is that the Liberals proposed this discussion and then voted against postponing the discussion to allow us to hear witnesses. I think it's a bit rich to blame the direction of this meeting on us.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412340" data-originallang="en">Our timeline is very tight. We need to hear from the <a data-HoCid="300004" href="/politicians/pascale-st-onge/" title="Pascale St-Onge">minister</a> by May 30. We haven't heard from the minister in a while, and she has been invited for the main estimates.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412341" data-originallang="en">As you note, Madam Chair, there is only a maximum of eight or maybe 10 meetings left before we rise for the summer. I know we're going down to two meetings in the amendment, but I am concerned about the amendment, and I'll tell you why.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412342" data-originallang="en">In 2009, my wife and I got my daughter to the March of the Living for educators. It was 2009. We sent our daughter over to Poland. To move ahead now, 14 or 15 years later, I am so thankful that we scraped together that money for her to go over to learn about the Holocaust and teach it in our classrooms.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412343" data-originallang="en">Now, when I see this motion in front of me, I'm a little disappointed that it doesn't include anti-Semitism because we're dealing with it in every city. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8412344" data-originallang="en">The two meetings would bring us towards the end of May, because we have the minister coming, and as duly noted by MP Thomas, we do need to hear about safe sport.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412345" data-originallang="en">You have had a lot of emails, Madam Chair, and I have had dozens of emails on safe sport. Outside of Hockey Canada's inquest, I would say it was the second-biggest item that we have dealt with in a number of years in the Canadian heritage committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412346" data-originallang="en"> I wanted to throw that out there. We just got the report—thank you to the analysts for working day and night to get the full report to us—and now we have some recommendations on safe sport. The whole country is waiting for that report, and I can see now it's going to be delayed until probably the first part of June, which is too bad.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412347" data-originallang="en">That's all I'll say on this. I was a little disappointed by the motion in that it did not include anti-Semitism, since I believe that is first and foremost what we've seen in this country from coast to coast.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412348" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
