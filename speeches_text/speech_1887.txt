<p data-HoCid="7345964" data-originallang="en">Thank you so much, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345965" data-originallang="en">About an hour ago, I requested the member speaking, MP Thomas, to be considerate in allowing me to ask the minister the final question, I believe it was, for that round.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345966" data-originallang="en">This is not the first time the member has used this tactic to cut people off from asking questions. It's not the first time we've had officials, who are very busy people doing great work, come into a meeting to just sit there and not be asked any questions. This is not the first time it's happened.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345967" data-originallang="en">I think it's important for people who are watching this who are really concerned about the rise of anti-Semitism and racism in this country to realize what's taking place here. We have a member of the Conservative party who has, for the last hour, held the floor for a motion, and, yes, people have intervened politely to try to ask the member to allow the motion to be voted on.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345968" data-originallang="en">This is why people are so turned away from politics today. You know, anyone tuning in to see what's going in the House of Commons and this committee would be disgusted with the display of the tactics that are being used to not allow people, the officials, to come in and explain what went wrong in the system, how we can improve the system, and how we could work towards eliminating the spread of hate in this country. This is our opportunity as members of Parliament to put in place the right type of protocols to ensure that this doesn't happen again.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345969" data-originallang="en">To the member, this program we have in place, a very innovative program that works with organizations across this country to look for ways to fight against hate, is an important issue. We see a constant rise in hate. In Toronto, the most hate crimes are committed against Jewish people. It's growing, and we need to make sure that our programs are working well.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345970" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, we only have now 12 minutes left, and it's a hard stop, I believe, at three o'clock. I'm going to ask the member again to let us vote on this motion. We understand exactly what the motion means. She's explained everything in detail. We know all the statistics, numbers and the points that she's made. The member does not have to educate us further on the meaning of the motion. We're capable at this point to make a decision based on the motion that's being put on the floor. It's very clear.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345971" data-originallang="en">Again, through you, Madam Chair, I'd ask the member to yield the floor and allow the 12 minutes that remain for officials to answer questions that people, not only in this room but in the public, want to hear the answers to.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345972" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
