<p data-HoCid="7931275" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the buck stops with the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>. That is simply not good enough, not one bit. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7931276" data-originallang="en">Not only did the Prime Minister bring shame on the House, but he also tried to bury this sordid affair with a motion on Monday to strike history from the record.

Its members are demanding a personal apology. </p>
