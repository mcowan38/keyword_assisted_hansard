<p data-HoCid="6675157" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, “There is no room in the Canadian Armed Forces for sexism, misogyny, racism, anti-Semitism, discrimination, harassment or any other conduct that prevents the institution from being a truly welcoming and inclusive organization.” That is how the <a data-HoCid="253808" href="/politicians/anita-vandenbeld/" title="Anita Vandenbeld">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence</a> began her reply to an Order Paper question from the member for <a data-HoCid="252603" href="/politicians/cheryl-gallant/" title="Cheryl Gallant">Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke</a> detailing how the Canadian Armed Forces deal with sexual misconduct. I want to give kudos to my colleague from Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke for her powerful and utter indictment that she just delivered.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6675158" data-originallang="en">It is becoming disturbingly clear that the Liberals have actually allowed room for sexual misconduct and harassment in the military despite all their rhetoric. Doubtlessly, they would be happy to take credit for how much progress has been made otherwise. Indeed, the <a data-HoCid="214311" href="/politicians/harjit-s-sajjan/" title="Harjit S. Sajjan">defence minister</a>, in particular, is not shy about taking credit, as he did when he stole valour and claimed to be the architect of Operation Medusa, but true to pattern, the Liberals are dodging, shutting down committees, keeping staff from being questioned and embroiled in yet another cover-up scandal. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6675159" data-originallang="en">Today it is Parliament's job to debate this cover-up by the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>'s own chief of staff. She was informed of specific sexual harassment allegations against General Jonathan Vance three years ago, three years of another victim's voice being silenced. Committee testimony revealed that senior PMO staffer Elder Marques briefed the Prime Minister's chief of staff about an issue related to the former chief of the defence staff and that the military ombudsman and the Canadian Armed Forces had discussions with the <a data-HoCid="214311" href="/politicians/harjit-s-sajjan/" title="Harjit S. Sajjan">Minister of National Defence</a>. Mr. Marques does not work for the Prime Minister or the Liberals anymore, so he was not barred from testifying at committee like every other Liberal staffer has been. His testimony shines a light on how high up these discussions went and how many people knew, but turned a blind eye.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6675160" data-originallang="en">In March 2018, the Privy Council Office was informed of the allegations, but came to an “impasse” and no further action was taken. This did not clear General Vance; rather, it only stalled the investigation. Even so, a pay raise that bureaucrats say the <a data-HoCid="214311" href="/politicians/harjit-s-sajjan/" title="Harjit S. Sajjan">minister</a> was involved in was still given to him in May 2019. Allegations began being publicly reported in 2021. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6675161" data-originallang="en">Five hundred and eighty-one is the number of sexual assaults reported under Operation Honour between April 1, 2016 and March 9, 2021. Two hundred and twenty-one is the number of sexual harassments reported during that same time period. These numbers represent real men and women in uniform and they are just the ones that are known. How many more have not and will not come forward because they see how these allegations are handled, because they see those in the highest positions of authority avoiding their responsibility to protect them, like the <a data-HoCid="214311" href="/politicians/harjit-s-sajjan/" title="Harjit S. Sajjan">Minister of National Defence</a>?</p>
<p data-HoCid="6675162" data-originallang="en">The <a data-HoCid="214311" href="/politicians/harjit-s-sajjan/" title="Harjit S. Sajjan">minister</a>'s inaction and evasiveness harm Canada's men and women in uniform. That is perhaps the most disturbing part. Operation Honour is referred to casually in the military as “operation hop on her” and, ironically, in the very worst way, was headed by General Vance. Many members of the military report that if they come forward with sexual assault allegations that are not proven, they are given two options: return to their unit or be honourably discharged. Effectively, they lose their jobs or go back with their abusers. Sadly, this kind of thing is not that unusual in predominantly closed institutions that rely on the discipline of a rigid power hierarchy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6675163" data-originallang="en">However, it is mind-boggling that the <a data-HoCid="214311" href="/politicians/harjit-s-sajjan/" title="Harjit S. Sajjan">minister</a> failed to take any real action during the past six years since the Deschamps report and recommendations on sexual misconduct and under-reporting in the military in 2015, while simultaneously declaring themselves a feminist government and turning a blind eye to allegations brought directly to him by the military ombudsman. That is six years of failing to act and to proactively address this systemic challenge for the men and women he served with and who served under him. The Minister of National Defence is avoiding his own responsibility and is an active part of this Liberal cover-up. I cannot fathom why he would choose to ignore the evidence brought to him by the ombudsman and to silence voices of victims, but perhaps the fact that General Vance was the minister's superior during his own military service is insightful.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6675164" data-originallang="en">Regardless, when confronted with difficult situations, strong leaders take responsibility and take action. The ombudsman confirmed that the <a data-HoCid="214311" href="/politicians/harjit-s-sajjan/" title="Harjit S. Sajjan">defence minister</a> was strong in one way, strong in his refusal to see any evidence about the allegations against General Vance and strong in his efforts to keep the ombudsman away from his office after that. He cancelled seven meetings to avoid further discussions. Ombudsman Walbourne testified, “I did tell the minister what the allegation was. I reached into my pocket to show him the evidence I was holding, and he pushed back from the table and said, 'No.'”</p>
<p data-HoCid="6675165" data-originallang="en">When presented with evidence of sexual misconduct, evading and avoiding can never be the reaction. The <a data-HoCid="214311" href="/politicians/harjit-s-sajjan/" title="Harjit S. Sajjan">defence minister</a> failed in his duty and has broken trust with men and women in the Canadian Armed Forces and with all Canadians more than once. It is reported that General Vance believes he is “untouchable”. I suggest the minister and all the people at the top have enabled that conclusion. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6675166" data-originallang="en">That seems to be systemic in this particular government. The <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> first claimed his office knew nothing about the allegations, but the evidence shows his most powerful, privileged and likely closest confidante and staff member knew about it. She abdicated her duty and orchestrated a cover-up of the allegations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6675167" data-originallang="en">She is also complicit in silencing voices of victims and survivors of sexual misconduct, and if she had nothing to hide, I think she would gladly step forward at committee and proactively share the steps the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, the <a data-HoCid="214311" href="/politicians/harjit-s-sajjan/" title="Harjit S. Sajjan">defence minister</a> and the government are taking to strengthen the reporting, investigations and consequences for sexual misconduct in the military.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6675168" data-originallang="en">Instead, Liberals are interfering with committee scrutiny and have announced yet another review rather than acting on recommendations from the major report done shortly before they were elected in 2015.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6675169" data-originallang="en">Canadians have heard this song and dance too many times from the Liberal government. It is yet another example of passing the buck, dodging responsibilities and saying one thing and doing another. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6675170" data-originallang="en">The filibustering of witness discussions at the Standing Committee on National Defence clearly imitates the filibustering, delaying and dodging that was a hallmark of the SNC-Lavalin scandal, where the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> pressured the former attorney general, who is the member for <a data-HoCid="253061" href="/politicians/jody-wilson-raybould/" title="Jody Wilson-Raybould">Vancouver Granville</a>, to interfere in an independent prosecution. When she refused and resisted months of relentless pressure, which he also denied, he fired her. It is much like the still-ongoing cover-up of the WE Charity scandal.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6675171" data-originallang="en">As recently as April 27, the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> said neither the <a data-HoCid="214311" href="/politicians/harjit-s-sajjan/" title="Harjit S. Sajjan">defence minister</a> nor his office knew the complaint against General Vance was one of sexual misconduct, but his own former staffer testified that he himself kept the chief of staff updated about the bureaucratic investigation into the claims and that the bureaucrats were informed the allegation was related to sexual harassment.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6675172" data-originallang="en">The Liberal <a data-HoCid="252970" href="/politicians/karen-mccrimmon/" title="Karen McCrimmon">chair</a> of the defence committee unceremoniously cancelled the meeting to which the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>'s chief of staff had been invited to clear all of this up. As recently as this past weekend, the <a data-HoCid="214311" href="/politicians/harjit-s-sajjan/" title="Harjit S. Sajjan">defence minister</a> studiously avoided answering directly whether he knew the allegation was sexual in nature. All of this stretches the bounds of believability of the Prime Minister's claim that no one really knew the details.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6675173" data-originallang="en">Of course it all makes sense in the context of hiding something. Canadians know well the lengths to which this particular government will go. With the Liberal government, where there is cover-up there is scandal. There are clearly networks of very powerful people at the very top who must be held accountable. As the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> once used to say, there is clearly a need for sunlight as the best disinfectant.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6675174" data-originallang="en">Quite obviously, the Liberals ought to actually walk their talk and work immediately to implement recommendations from the report they have sat on since 2015 instead of doing another review, despite the esteem of the former justice now in charge of it, because justice delayed is also justice denied. For victims of sexual harassment and abuse, that is only too true.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6675175" data-originallang="en">Operation HONOUR itself puts a fine point on it, in the Path to Dignity and Respect: </p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="6675176" data-originallang="en"> Whether real or perceived, organizational tolerance of sexual misconduct or a pervasive insufficient organizational response to incidents will contribute to a climate where sexual misconduct is ignored, minimized or excused and impacts the willingness of people to report incidents. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="6675177" data-originallang="en">It is chilling that the top soldier in charge of Operation HONOUR was the very person who reportedly intimidated and threatened consequences against his target. Major Kellie Brennan said:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="6675178" data-originallang="en"> It's recorded...him directing me in what to say, what not to say, how to say it, what to exclude, to perjure myself and to lie. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="6675179" data-originallang="en">She added:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="6675180" data-originallang="en"> I definitely feel that there will not be justice for me...if my speaking out can change everything for other women to come forward and change our policies, that's okay with me. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="6675181" data-originallang="en">Such a debt of gratitude is owed to her and to all men and women who volunteer to enter into harm's way to protect all of us and serve in the Canadian Armed Forces. The loss of trust in leadership must be staggering and it must be severely damaging. The least that can be done is for the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> to take the first step in showing that people will be held to account by firing his chief of staff, but it cannot stop there. The <a data-HoCid="214311" href="/politicians/harjit-s-sajjan/" title="Harjit S. Sajjan">defence minister</a> is also complicit and also needs to be held accountable for his actions.</p>
