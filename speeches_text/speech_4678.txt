<p data-HoCid="8524043" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8524044" data-originallang="en">You're quite right. I think the heart of the matter of where we're at right now is trying to find out who this Randy is—the person I affectionately call “alibi Randy”. There have been lots of bizarre twists and turns at this committee in just trying to get to the heart of the matter.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8524045" data-originallang="en">Quite frankly, whether it was the <a data-HoCid="300005" href="/politicians/randy-boissonnault/" title="Randy Boissonnault">minister</a> or the company in question...and I respect that the minister would have to say, of course, that he wouldn't have any knowledge of anybody inside this company. However, we've heard arguments from the governing side here, from the Liberal Party, that somehow disclosing this information is a grave violation of privacy. It has been equated to some kind of circus. I would say that in this particular case, the circus is of the minister's making.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8524046" data-originallang="en">Just to recap, this is a company with millions of dollars in contracts, something like $8 million. There are allegations of fraud, which, to my understanding and publicly reported, haven't even been defended, and then there's just the whole structure of the way in which the minister has such a close relationship to this day. It doesn't pass the smell test, quite frankly.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8524047" data-originallang="en"> Really, all of this—I'll say it again—could have been avoided if the real Randy had just stood up. If the company had just said it—this is Randy, this is what Randy does, this is Randy's contract—it would all have gone away. Now we're going down some rabbit hole about phone records. While I think the use of the term “burner phone” might perhaps come off as a bit dramatic, the truth is that it would be expected that a minister and it would be expected that most members of Parliament would have their own personal phone lines. Of course they would. You wouldn't want to conduct anything personal or non-business-related on your cabinet cellphone.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8524048" data-originallang="en"> I'm unwilling to accept all of the drama around time zones and cabinet retreats and faraday boxes and all of these different types of things. I'm simply interested in finding out, officially, who this Randy is. Who is alibi Randy? Absent alibi Randy, I would say that the <a data-HoCid="300005" href="/politicians/randy-boissonnault/" title="Randy Boissonnault">minister</a> has dug himself into quite a hole here. On the surface of it, he lacks credibility in his testimony. On the surface of it, on the stories that have been reported—they are publicly reported and have not yet been refuted, I think, in a meaningful way—that a minister would even want to be tangentially related and connected to a company as nuclear as this, in this moment, seems beyond my understanding. He wouldn't answer basic questions about payouts, and was obstructionist and obfuscated on what I think were very straightforward questions. For that reason, we're at this point.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8524049" data-originallang="en">I would have liked to hear from the Ghaoui company. I would have liked to hear from all of the witnesses to get to the heart of the matter. If it is the case that this story, as convoluted and bizarre as it is unfolding, was technically legally allowed, we have problems. To the average person, to the objective person on the outside looking at this, given the facts that have been reported, given the lack of any, I think, substantive defence by the <a data-HoCid="300005" href="/politicians/randy-boissonnault/" title="Randy Boissonnault">minister</a> and by this company, I think it puts it all at risk, quite frankly. Any time there's a scandal in this committee, I believe the general public doesn't necessarily discern whether it's Liberal, Conservative, Bloc or New Democrat. In their minds, I believe they just see all politicians as being corrupt. There's a kind of broad brush. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8524050" data-originallang="en">We've heard today in the arguments from the Liberal side that they're now being pulled into this. Why? Why are you allowing yourselves to be pulled into this mess when it's not your mess? You are not receiving deferred payments from this company. You do not have a 50% interest in a company that had almost $8 million in contracts that, as I understand, are being pursued for various allegations of fraud. That's not your mess. Why you're putting in the extra overtime work to try to make this go away doesn't make sense to me as a New Democrat.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8524051" data-originallang="en">While I appreciate the way in which social media, personal attacks, ad hominem attacks and information taken out of context has a direct impact on the way we do our business, this simply could have been solved, absent the filibuster last meeting, with straightforward answers and with a minister who was willing to take responsibility and accountability for the role and involvement they had in this company and whether or not they were in contact with them. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8524052" data-originallang="en"> What we have to do, as a committee, when this is done, hopefully, is provide recommendations to close whatever gaps and loopholes seem to exist and are present here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8524053" data-originallang="en">For that reason, Mr. Chair, I certainly will not be supporting this amendment. I don't want to go down this bizarre rabbit hole of the forensic auditing of people's phone accounts, assuming that they only have one phone line. I don't know what <a data-HoCid="300005" href="/politicians/randy-boissonnault/" title="Randy Boissonnault">Randy</a>'s number was before he was a minister. I don't know what phones he has or doesn't have. I don't think we have the power to investigate that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8524054" data-originallang="en">This notion that we're just going to take their word for it, quite frankly, doesn't cut it. It just doesn't cut it. I'm unwilling to do that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8524055" data-originallang="en">I have no ill will toward <a data-HoCid="300005" href="/politicians/randy-boissonnault/" title="Randy Boissonnault">Mr. Boissonnault</a> or my Liberal colleagues here. I get along with them, I think. We work together. I work together with members on the opposition side to hold the government accountable. That, ultimately, is our role.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8524056" data-originallang="en">Again, for the people who are watching, all of this can be solved by <a data-HoCid="300005" href="/politicians/randy-boissonnault/" title="Randy Boissonnault">Mr. Boissonnault</a> and the people who are connected to this company proactively disclosing who alibi Randy is. That, to me, would have been the simplest thing to do a week ago to make all of this go away. Say, “My name is alibi Randy, and this is who I am. This is what my job is. Here's my contract. Here's long how long I've been working” and it's case closed. We can move on.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8524057" data-originallang="en">I'm telling you that all of this extra effort.... I said this to the <a data-HoCid="300005" href="/politicians/randy-boissonnault/" title="Randy Boissonnault">minister</a>. I'm going to say it to my Liberal colleagues. It doesn't look great. It just doesn't look good from where I sit, which is certainly not anywhere close to the Conservative caucus, but as an objective person of this committee, from where I sit, the more you all dig in on this, the worse it's going to look for everybody involved.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8524058" data-originallang="en">Let's avoid all of that. Let's have alibi Randy stand up, maybe even do an interview, talk about the good work of this company and perhaps provide some kind of defence for the allegations that have been thrown their way—I don't think they've done that in court yet—and then let's move on.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8524059" data-originallang="en"> I'm not going to be party to some procedural shenanigans or anything else, like some subamendments to an amendment that will take us off track and ultimately try to obstruct, delay or frustrate our just getting to a basic answer. I don't intend to participate much more in this meeting beyond this. I just want to go on the record and be very clear on where I stand.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8524060" data-originallang="en">I support this. I think it's a reasonable motion that Mr. Barrett has put forward. I think it could all be solved if this company just took some accountability and responsibility for once and disclosed who alibi Randy is.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8524061" data-originallang="en">What I'm telling you right now.... I'm just going to say it. You have all had your time for your filibusters, so I'm going to have mine right now. I don't think there's an alibi Randy. There it is. There it is folks. I don't think there's another Randy, and I think that's why we're in this mess.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8524062" data-originallang="en"> Now it's left to <a data-HoCid="300005" href="/politicians/randy-boissonnault/" title="Randy Boissonnault">Mr. Boissonnault</a> and his colleagues at this company, which he supposedly no longer has any dealings with, but still receives 50% ownership and, ostensibly, payouts to the extent that we aren't fully clear about.... I don't think there's a Randy. The onus is going to be on this company to prove there is, not on us to prove there isn't.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8524063" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
