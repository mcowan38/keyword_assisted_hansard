<p data-HoCid="7553499" data-originallang="en">I was listening to the translation. I hope I properly understood your question. I think you were asking about the tribunal process and some of the economic analysis that was undertaken.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7553500" data-originallang="en">It was a process with 40-plus witnesses, including my colleague Dr. Israel. The bureau had its own economic expert, Professor Miller from Georgetown. There was a long discussion of the modelling. I think we had a lot of critiques of Professor Miller's model. One of the most important ones was that he was calibrating his model to data that was almost two years old. Because he was using old data, he was not calibrating his model to a proper, forward-looking view of what the industry was going to look like.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7553501" data-originallang="en">There were many problems with the model. We criticized them. I don't have time to get into all the technical details, but I will say that the tribunal largely, as I think you said in your question, agreed with our analysis and agreed with the critiques that Dr. Israel put forward about the bureau's economic expert. It ultimately concluded that his model was not sufficient to show there was any substantial lessening of competition because of the transaction.</p>
