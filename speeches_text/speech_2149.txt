<p data-HoCid="7645836" data-originallang="en"> Yes. I think there's a degree of variation. There are instances where we do speak up on human rights, but perhaps not with the vigour that is needed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7645837" data-originallang="en">I would mention countries.... Even as recently as Peru, which just experienced a serious crisis. Here, I would highlight, sometimes, the conflict between trade interests and human rights. I think that's a very real conflict that needs to be resolved in terms of foreign policy. We need to be clear about what supersedes what—whether human rights actually supersede trade interests—and follow through.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7645838" data-originallang="en">Definitely in Latin America there were a number of cases. There was Peru, and also Colombia and elsewhere. Another example would be the situation of women in Palestine, for instance, which we don't hear about sufficiently because of Canada's position in relation to Israel. You can uphold the rights of both Israeli women and Palestinian women. It is very much possible and that's the lens that needs to be used across the board.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7645839" data-originallang="en">I'm a little bit concerned about the rapprochement with India and with Modi's government as well. I think we need to be very mindful of what is happening in India and ensure that our relationships do not, again, hinder our ability to speak up on human rights globally.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7645840" data-originallang="en">Egypt is another case that needs very strong and sustained positions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7645841" data-originallang="en">As much as Canada has to manoeuvre its relationship with these countries in order to be a credible partner and sometimes a trade partner, it will only benefit Canada to be consistent across the board on its policies on human rights. That's the beauty of diplomacy. There's a way of being able to do both—to uphold trade interests while also prioritizing human rights across the board.</p>
