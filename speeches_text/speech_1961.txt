<p data-HoCid="7366788" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, Canadians care about human rights. We stand up for human rights, whether it is for the Uighur Muslims in the People's Republic of China and whether it is the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar and around the world. We must also stand up for Palestinian human rights. We must make it very clear that as a staunch friend of Israel we also call for human rights to be respected for the people of Palestine. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7366789" data-originallang="en">There are two important UN resolutions coming up. I want to ask the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, will Canada consider please voting for the motion to respect what is happening, to help Palestinian refugees and to take action on Israeli settlements?</p>
