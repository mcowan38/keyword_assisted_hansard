<p data-HoCid="8455648" data-originallang="en">It's a great question, and I thank you for it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455649" data-originallang="en">For me, there's a multifactor answer to it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455650" data-originallang="en">The first is that I think people genuinely don't understand anti-Semitism. I think with the lack of understanding of anti-Semitism comes a lack of understanding of where the boundaries have been crossed and a criminal offence has been committed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455651" data-originallang="en">For me, it's back to the training and education that we've talked about. It's back to having dedicated prosecutors who are dealing with these issues every day. It's back to having a national strategy so that people understand what this is all about.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455652" data-originallang="en">Part of it, unfortunately, is latent anti-Semitism. I'm not suggesting that I would lightly attribute decisions on not to prosecute to someone being anti-Semitic, because I think ignorance is the bigger problem here when it comes to prosecutions and police, but that definitely does exist.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455653" data-originallang="en">The third thing that I think is of critical importance is that freedom of speech is now being weaponized and deliberately distorted in a way that inhibits prosecution. For example, when I say here that the celebration of barbarity by Hamas is not protected speech or when I say here that “by any means necessary” is not protected speech, then I will be accused of Islamophobia. I will be accused of propagating hatred, completely misunderstanding or distorting where those boundaries are.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455654" data-originallang="en">As I said, I've worked with members of the Muslim community. I've been involved in Muslim-Jewish dialogue. That distortion is contributing to the inhibition to prosecute legitimate cases.</p>
