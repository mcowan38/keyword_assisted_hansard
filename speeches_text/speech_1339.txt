<p data-HoCid="6924299" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce my private member's bill, an act to amend the Criminal Code in order to prohibit the promotion of anti-Semitism. I would like to thank my colleague from <a data-HoCid="278731" href="/politicians/melissa-lantsman/" title="Melissa Lantsman">Thornhill</a> for sponsoring this important bill.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6924300" data-originallang="en">From early 1941 to the spring of 1945, six million Jewish children, women and men were murdered in a state-sponsored genocide we now remember as the Holocaust. Holocaust distortion, denial and anti-Semitism must be confronted with the strongest opposition and condemnation. Ignorance fuels intolerance. We must continue to teach the truths of the past. Education is the safeguard of history. We must face history with courage and boldly call out and confront intolerance whenever it exists. The passage of this bill would protect the truth.</p>
