<p data-HoCid="7082507" data-originallang="en">I want to touch back on the issue of the missing and murdered indigenous women and girls. I just want to note that the national action plan must outline timelines, responsibilities, milestones, indicators, resources and indigenous leadership for each and every call for justice, as well as regional and sector-specific reports and recommendations. I hope that there will be action taken in this regard and that it would be outlined in the upcoming budget.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7082508" data-originallang="en">The minister touched on the issue of poverty, and we know from research that raising living standards and lifting individuals out of poverty are one of the key ways to address intimate partner violence.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7082509" data-originallang="en"> <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">MP Leah Gazan</a> has put forward a bill for a guaranteed livable basic income, to ensure that individuals and families doing unpaid care work can have economic autonomy and opportunities to leave harmful living situations. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7082510" data-originallang="en"> I'd like to ask the minister if she would agree that this is a fundamental step for the government to take to lift individuals out of poverty. Will she support that private member's bill?</p>
