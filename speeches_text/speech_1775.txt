<p data-HoCid="7265065" data-originallang="en">I agree with what Mr. Israel said earlier, which was that the onus and the burden should be on the entities seeking to use facial recognition. Certainly I think private companies would say there's an advantage. They are making money off of it. Collecting data, as we know, is very profitable. I don't think that's an advantage this committee should consider when weighed against the invasion of rights.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7265066" data-originallang="en">When we're talking about law enforcement and government uses, I think it's true that new technology will always be claimed to be solving age-old problems, but I don't see any evidence that the use of facial recognition technology and any perceived benefits it might bring to law enforcement outweigh the type of transformation it would render in society.</p>
