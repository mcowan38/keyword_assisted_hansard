<p data-HoCid="8456010" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8456011" data-originallang="fr">My question is for Mr. Saini, from McGill University.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8456012" data-originallang="fr">We are obviously talking about antisemitism, since that is the topic of the study the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights is currently conducting, but there are other forms of hate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8456013" data-originallang="fr">At McGill University, aside from the cases of antisemitism we are talking about, are there also cases of Islamophobia, racism or homophobia, for example? Are there other forms of hate that currently exist on McGill University's campus?</p>
