<p data-HoCid="8594902" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, Judih Weinstein, Vivian Silver, Ben Mizrachi, Netta Epstein, Shir Georgy, Alexandre Look, Adi Vital-Kaploun, Tiferet Lapidot, may their memories be a blessing. It was my honour to have met with their families here at home and in Israel. On the anniversary of Hamas's horrific attacks, my promise to their loved ones is the following: Year after year, Canadians will honour their memories. We stand with Jewish people. We will not relent until the last hostage returns home.</p>
