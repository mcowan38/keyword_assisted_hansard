<p data-HoCid="8455474" data-originallang="en">To start, I think it's important to say that what we've been hearing in our conversations with Jewish students and leaders in the past several weeks is how important it is that these codes of conduct be enforced in a way that's equal to all groups and provides protection to all groups, including, of course, members of our Jewish community. That's the message that's being delivered by the community to our university leaders. Universities are using all of their policies, including codes of conduct, to ensure that the proper standards are upheld, but of course, there is a lot of work to do. We've seen examples, I think, where, clearly, we're letting our Jewish students and faculty down, and there's a great deal of work to do to improve our performance.</p>
