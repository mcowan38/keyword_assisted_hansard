<p data-HoCid="6112442" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6112443" data-originallang="en">I'm going to try to clean up a few of what I think are loose ends from the discussion in this final round. I feel that I need to start by responding to the outrageous misstatement of our position by Ms. Sahota.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6112444" data-originallang="en">I want you to know, Minister, that our party would love to see Canada on the UN Security Council. What we're concerned about is some of the decisions that seem to be made with an eye to getting that seat, such as the decision of your government to vote in favour of a North Korean-sponsored resolution that singled out Israel. We haven't seen resolutions put forward on other human rights issues, yet Canada broke from what had been our pattern and voted in favour of that resolution. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6112445" data-originallang="en">I just want to drill down. If Canada is successful—and we hope Canada is successful—can you commit to us that you will champion substantial UN reform from the Security Council, that you will make it a priority that the UN address some of these perverse outcomes, such as Iran and Saudi Arabia being on the women's rights commission? Under your leadership, will Canada be a champion for substantial reform at the UN if Canada has that position?</p>
