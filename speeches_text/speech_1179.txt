<p data-HoCid="6798910" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to address this issue this afternoon. There are a couple of aspects that I would like to provide some comment on, but first and foremost is the idea of Bill <a data-HoCid="11283337" href="/bills/43-2/C-30/" title="An Act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on April 19, 2021 and other measures">C-30</a>, now at report stage, and how important passing it is to all Canadians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6798911" data-originallang="en">The other day, I talked about a progressive agenda. The Government of Canada has put forward a very strong, healthy, progressive agenda that includes today's bill, Bill <a data-HoCid="10959361" href="/bills/43-2/C-12/" title="An Act respecting transparency and accountability in Canada's efforts to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050">C-12</a>, Bill <a data-HoCid="10871883" href="/bills/43-2/C-6/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (conversion therapy)">C-6</a>, Bill <a data-HoCid="10926636" href="/bills/43-2/C-10/" title="An Act to amend the Broadcasting Act and to make related and consequential amendments to other Acts">C-10</a>, Bill <a data-HoCid="11104167" href="/bills/43-2/C-22/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act">C-22</a> and Bill <a data-HoCid="11102978" href="/bills/43-2/C-21/" title="An Act to amend certain Acts and to make certain consequential amendments (firearms)">C-21</a>. Of course, I often make reference to Bill <a data-HoCid="11031427" href="/bills/43-2/C-19/" title="An Act to amend the Canada Elections Act (COVID-19 response)">C-19</a> as well. All of these pieces of legislation are important to the government, but I would argue that the most important one is the bill we are debating today, Bill C-30.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6798912" data-originallang="en">The budget is of critical importance for a wide variety of reasons. I can talk about the benefits that seniors would be receiving as a direct result of this budget bill, in particular those who are 75 and over, with the significant fulfillment of our campaign promise of a 10% increase to OAS for seniors aged 75 and above, and a one-time payment coming up in the month of August for that group. During the pandemic, we have been there for seniors, in particular those 65 and over, with one-time payments closer to the beginning of the pandemic, and even an extra amount for those who were on the guaranteed income supplement. That is not to mention the many different organizations that the government supported, whether directly or indirectly, to support our seniors, in particular non-profit organizations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6798913" data-originallang="en">We have done a multitude of things, many of which are very tangible. The <a data-HoCid="263831" href="/politicians/chrystia-freeland/" title="Chrystia Freeland">Minister of Finance</a> made reference to the extension of some of the programs, for example, which we brought in so we could continue to be there for businesses and real people. This was so important. At the beginning of the process, the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> made it very clear that this government, the Liberal Party and the Liberal members of the House of Commons were 100% committed to working seven days a week, 24 hours a day to ensure that the interests of Canadians in combatting and fighting the pandemic were going to be priority number one. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6798914" data-originallang="en">As to that priority, we saw the establishment of a large number of new programs that ensured money was being put directly into the pockets of Canadians. One was the CERB, which benefited somewhere around nine million Canadians. Virtually out of nowhere this program came into being, in good part thanks to our civil servants, who have done a tremendous job in putting in place and administering the many different programs.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6798915" data-originallang="en">We have seen programs to support our businesses in particular, whether it is the Canada emergency wage subsidy program, the emergency rent subsidy program, the emergency business account or the regional relief and recovery fund. We recognized what Canada needed. The Government of Canada worked with Canadians and with, in particular, provinces, non-profits, territories, indigenous leaders and many others in order to make sure that Canadians were going to be protected as much as possible. All of this was done with the goal of being able to get us, as a nation, out of the situation we are currently in.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6798916" data-originallang="en">We have put ourselves in a position where Canada will be able to recover, and recover well. It is interesting to hear the Conservative Party asking about the debt. Many of the things I just finished talking about are the reasons why we have the debt. The Conservatives in many ways are saying we should be spending more money, while the Conservative right is saying we have spent too much money or is asking about the debt. Some Conservatives are talking about the creation of jobs. The most recent Conservative commitment was that they would create one million jobs.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6798917" data-originallang="en">Between 2015, when the Liberals were first elected, and the election of 2019, we created over a million jobs. We understand how important jobs are. Jobs are one of the reasons it was important for us to commit to businesses of all sizes, and small businesses in particular, to get through this difficult time. We knew that by saving companies from going bankrupt and by keeping Canadians employed we would be in a much better position once we got ahead of the pandemic.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6798918" data-originallang="en">I am actually quite pleased today. I started off by looking at the national news. A CBC story said that when it comes to first doses Canada is now ahead of Israel, according to a graph that was posted. When we think of populations of a million or more, Canada is doing exceptionally well. We are ahead of all other nations in dealing with the first dose.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6798919" data-originallang="en">I am now qualified to get my second dose. Earlier today I had the opportunity to book an appointment for a second dose on July 7. Canadians are responding so well to the need for vaccination. We understand why it is so important that we all get vaccinated. We need to continue to encourage people to get those shots.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6798920" data-originallang="en">It goes without saying that we need to recognize many very special people who have been there for Canadians. The ones who come to mind immediately are the health care workers here in the province of Manitoba. They are a special group of people that not long ago, in a virtual meeting, the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> expressed gratitude for in a very strong and significant way. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6798921" data-originallang="en">Our health care workers, whether the nurses, doctors or lab technicians, and people in all areas of health care, including those providing and sanitizing facilities as well as a whole litany of people, have ensured that we have been there from a health perspective.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6798922" data-originallang="en">We can look at workers involved with essential items such as groceries. Whether it was long haul truck drivers, people stacking groceries or collecting money for groceries, or taxi drivers who took people where they needed to go, whether to the hospital or the grocery store, they were there. Public institutions were there. I think of Winnipeg Transit bus drivers who opened their doors not knowing who was walking onto their buses. They were all there.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6798923" data-originallang="en">This legislation we are debating today is a continuation of getting Canada in a better, healthier position to deal with the coronavirus. We needed to bring in time allocation because of the destructive behaviour of the official opposition. We wanted to work and the Conservatives wanted to take time off. There was an excellent indication of that last Thursday, which was the biggest day in terms of debate for government. The Conservatives attempted to end the session only moments after the day got under way. It is not right that the Conservatives are playing games. We need to pass this legislation. I would ask all members to vote for it.</p>
