<p data-HoCid="7773596" data-originallang="en"> Thank you for the opportunity to present to you. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7773597" data-originallang="en">As a Greek, I guess my presentation is a bit more emotional—I apologize. I want to point out that you're going to be hearing from some patients, like Julie Elliott and Terri McGregor, who've now spent the better part of their lives as breast implant safety advocates because their lives were turned upside down by breast implants. There are thousands more just like them. Many Canadian women have now died as a direct result of breast implants. Yet, as a physician, despite being a plastic surgeon, my Hippocratic oath is to do no harm.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7773598" data-originallang="en"> I'm here because I consider that my speciality of plastic surgery, along with the breast implant companies, have failed patients on a colossal scale by not identifying and addressing the various problems caused by breast implants in a timely manner. Had there been a registry from the beginning, these problems would have been recognized, obliging breast implant companies to be more proactive rather than reactive. Instead, patients have had to pay the price by falling ill, or worse yet, dying.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7773599" data-originallang="en">Breast implants were introduced in 1962. Within a year, there were patients with inflammatory conditions and what is now referred to as breast implant illness, or BII. Dr. Lennox was talking about ALCL, which I'll address a bit, but I'm focusing a bit on breast implant illness.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7773600" data-originallang="en">In the absence of a registry, these individual complaints were brushed aside by both breast implant companies and plastic surgeons, with the claim that breast implants were completely benign. This is way back when, in 1963. Instead, patients were made to feel as though they had mental illness. No studies were performed by the breast implant companies. They were too busy making money. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7773601" data-originallang="en">These patient complaints and no studies continued for 30 years, leading up to the famous Dow Corning lawsuit settlement between 1994 and 1998. The Food and Drug Administration in the U.S. was compelled to withdraw gel implants from the market in 1992, because breast implant companies had failed to ensure and document the safety of their implants. In the following years, a number of small studies suggested the safety of breast implants. The problem is that these studies that appeared were performed by plastic surgeons who were receiving funding from breast implant companies. Conflict of interest is a huge problem when it comes to breast implant safety, and it's easy enough to understand that a plastic surgeon who's being paid by a breast implant company cannot be relied upon to study breast implants in a neutral fashion. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7773602" data-originallang="en">Moreover, with an illness as complex and multifactorial as BII, large studies with thousands of patients have to be performed, something that can only be achieved with a registry. In fact, Fryzek and Watad looked at thousands of patients in the Danish and Israeli registries, respectively, and they found that patients with breast implants did in fact have a higher incidence of rheumatic problems. Nevertheless, these numerous small studies performed by breast implant consultants suggested the safety of breast implants, along with a huge push from a billion-dollar industry, and that convinced the FDA to return gel implants to the market in 2006.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7773603" data-originallang="en">For another 10 years, patients continued to experience BII, but now they were told the studies by reputable American plastic surgeons proved that breast implants were benign. If it weren't for the recognition of that lymphoma in 2016, which Dr. Lennox referred to and which was caused by textured implants, breast implant companies would still be telling patients that their implants were perfectly benign. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7773604" data-originallang="en">Given the absence of a registry, as Dr. Lennox mentioned, this lymphoma was felt to occur very rarely—they said one in a million cases—such that some plastic surgeons even questioned whether they should mention the risk of lymphoma to patients. To give you an idea of just how bad conflict of interest can get, a leading breast implant consultant in the U.S. was so defensive of breast implants that he argued that the lymphoma was caused by poor surgical technique rather than the implant texturing. That issue may have delayed the voluntary recall of Biocell implants, which are now recognized to result in lymphoma in somewhere in the order of one in 400 cases—hardly one in a million. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7773605" data-originallang="en">Here I am, sitting in front of you, 61 years after the introduction of breast implants. I'm taking out breast implants that are making my patients sick and that my colleagues keep putting in. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7773606" data-originallang="en"> When patients ask me the simple question of why they're getting sick from their breast implants, I don't have a definitive answer to give them, because we don't have enough data. Why? It is because we don't have a registry.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7773607" data-originallang="en">Thank you for your time.</p>
