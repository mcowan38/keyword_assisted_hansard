<p data-HoCid="8391443" data-originallang="en">I want to be very clear, Mr. Chair. I would not have to explain any of this had Ms. Thomas not put on social media things that represented my position and the position of my colleagues. Had this been an honest conversation about the urgent need for all of us to come together on a motion that skipped the politicization and went clearly to the heart of the issue that we need to be talking about, which is the fight against anti-Semitism, we wouldn't be in this position today. I think it's important for us to take out the preambles, assertions and value judgments about newspapers being sources, and actually say that this committee is unequivocally united in its support for the fight against anti-Semitism, and that fight is one that must be taken on by all. That is something I believe every single member of this committee would stand for. What I find deeply troubling is that this is not the first time, Mr. Chair, that some have chosen to use social media to grossly misrepresent the views of people on this side, of others, and to seek to try to foment discord in communities that are already hurting. </p>
