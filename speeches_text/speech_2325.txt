<p data-HoCid="7729092" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Ms. Gazan.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7729093" data-originallang="en">That concludes this round of witnesses. I would like, at this time, to thank the witnesses for presenting today and answering the questions. We will suspend, and the witnesses can leave at this time, but then members who are here virtually will have to come back in, as the committee will move into an in camera business portion for the next, roughly, 30 minutes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7729094" data-originallang="en">Again, thank you, witnesses and committee members. We will suspend for a couple of minutes while we reconnect.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7729095" data-originallang="en"> <em>Merci beaucoup</em>.</p>
