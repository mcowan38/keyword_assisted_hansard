<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Thank you. A written answer would be great.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">When I started, I talked a bit about consistency. We do know—and I'll just read it out to you—that the Senate recommended that the Government of Canada “should seek to be consistent in its global application of autonomous sanctions imposed in response to human rights violations.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">We have seen over the past several years that for Russia, Iran, Myanmar, Venezuela, Haiti and Sri Lanka, individuals from these countries have been sanctioned, but noticeably absent from our list are countries where clear human rights abuses are occurring, where there are extremists in government or where there have been threats to international peace and security. Of course, right now I'm thinking of Saudi Arabia in particular, but we've also heard from some Canadians who are calling for sanctions in other areas: for example, in Uganda, where we have seen their recent anti-LGBTQ2+ legislation, or in Israel, where we have seen illegal settlements happening.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">I'm wondering if you could provide more clarity on how that happens. There is very little clarity for Canadians on the decision-making process in how sanctions are applied. They don't seem to be consistent at this point.</p>
