<p data-HoCid="8465022" data-originallang="fr">In my presentation, I explained the issue of hate speech. When it comes to parts 2, 3 and 4 of the bill, we have questions that we want to work on.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8465023" data-originallang="fr">It was in fact to deal with anti-Semitism and hate speech against the Jewish community that the Bloc Québécois introduced the member for <a data-HoCid="278267" href="/politicians/yves-francois-blanchet/" title="Yves-François Blanchet">Beloeil—Chambly</a>'s bill.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8465024" data-originallang="fr">Then there is the whole issue of freedom of expression, which is critical but certainly not simple. There is a fine line between wanting to take action and knowing how to deal with algorithms without attacking freedom of expression. That is why I think that we need to hear from experts in committee. We need to hear suggestions from experts on these very serious issues. That is such a fine line that we truly need help to walk that line and strike a delicate balance between the two. It is critically important.</p>
