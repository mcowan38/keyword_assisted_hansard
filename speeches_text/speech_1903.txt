<p data-HoCid="7380725" data-originallang="fr">Thank you very much, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7380726" data-originallang="en">Thanks for being here today. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7380727" data-originallang="en">Mr. Scott, I want to come back to the issue of the Community Media Advocacy Centre. You've just testified that $32,147 was given in two payments to the Community Media Advocacy Centre and Mr. Marouf. Can you tell us how much was provided by the broadcast participation fund?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7380728" data-originallang="en">My second question is related to the measures that have been taken. We've seen rising anti-Semitism, rising Islamophobia and rising racism, often violent. We had the convoy and the flying of Nazi flags. We have a threat in terms of racism and hate in our society. What measures has the CRTC taken, both for your own operations and also for any funds that are related to the CRTC, to ensure that those who hate do not receive any more funding?</p>
