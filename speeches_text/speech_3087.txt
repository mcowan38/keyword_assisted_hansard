<p data-HoCid="8066447" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I am rising on a point of order challenging the admissibility of Ways and Means Motion No. 19 concerning the fall economic statement implementation bill, which was tabled earlier today by the <a data-HoCid="263835" href="/politicians/chrystia-freeland/" title="Chrystia Freeland">Deputy Prime Minister</a>. It is my submission that the motion offends the rule against anticipation, sometimes also known as the “same question rule”. That rule is described on page 568 of <em>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</em>, which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8066448" data-originallang="en"> The rule is dependent on the principle which forbids the same question from being decided twice within the same session. It does not apply, however, to similar or identical motions or bills which appear on the Notice Paper prior to debate. The rule of anticipation becomes operative only when one of two similar motions on the Order Paper is actually proceeded with. For example, two bills similar in substance will be allowed to stand on the Order Paper but only one may be moved and disposed of. If a decision is taken on the first bill (for example, to defeat the bill or advance it through a stage in the legislative process), then the other may not be proceeded with...If the first bill is withdrawn (by unanimous consent, often after debate has started), then the second may be proceeded with. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8066449" data-originallang="en">The rule against anticipation has been building a significant number of precedents in the past few years in light of the NDP-Liberal government's growing pattern of stealing common-sense Conservative private members' bills to add to their own legislative agenda. While our authorities suggest that such points of order should be raised only when the second question is actually proposed from the Chair, I recognize that in light of Ways and Means Motion No. 19 being an omnibus proposal, exceeding 500 pages in length, you, Madam Speaker, might appreciate having the evening to reflect on the issues I am about to discuss before the government intends to call it for consideration tomorrow.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8066450" data-originallang="en">In the present case, Ways and Means Motion No. 19 includes provisions that the House has already adopted in principle at second reading through two private members' bills.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8066451" data-originallang="en"> On September 20, the House passed second reading Bill <a data-HoCid="12260777" href="/bills/44-1/C-318/" title="An Act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and the Canada Labour Code (adoptive and intended parents)">C-318</a>, an act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and the Canada Labour Code, sponsored by the Conservative hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278203" href="/politicians/rosemarie-falk/" title="Rosemarie Falk">Battlefords—Lloydminster</a>. The summary printed on the inside cover of the bill reads: </p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8066452" data-originallang="en"> This enactment amends the Employment Insurance Act to introduce a new type of special benefits: an attachment benefit of 15 weeks for adoptive parents and parents of children conceived through surrogacy. It also amends the Canada Labour Code to extend parental leave accordingly. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8066453" data-originallang="en">Last week's fall economic statement on pages 43 and 42 states that:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8066454" data-originallang="en"> The 2023 Fall Economic Statement proposes to introduce a new 15-week shareable EI adoption...Surrogate parents will also be eligible for this benefit. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8066455" data-originallang="en"> The 2023 Fall Economic Statement also proposes to make amendments to the Employment Insurance Act, as well as corresponding changes to the Canada Labour Code, to ensure that workers in federally regulated industries have the job protection they need while receiving the EI adoption benefit. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8066456" data-originallang="en">Those provisions appear as clauses 342 to 365 of Ways and Means Motion No. 19. While the legislative language used varies, the ultimate policy objective and therefore the principle of the matter remains the same as a close examination of the two passages I quoted reveals.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8066457" data-originallang="en">The second private member's bill stolen by the government this week is Bill <a data-HoCid="12260850" href="/bills/44-1/C-323/" title="An Act to amend the Excise Tax Act (mental health services)">C-323</a>, an act to amend the Excise Tax Act, mental health services, sponsored by the Conservative member for <a data-HoCid="278126" href="/politicians/stephen-ellis/" title="Stephen Ellis">Cumberland—Colchester</a>, which the House passed at second reading on September 27. My colleague's bill would amend sections 1 and 7 of part II of schedule V of the Excise Tax Act to exempt psychotherapy and mental health counselling from GST. Clause 137 of Ways and Means Motion No. 19 would do the exact same thing, except that the government refers to “counselling therapy” instead of Bill C-323's “mental health counselling”. That is, I would submit, a distinction without a difference.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8066458" data-originallang="en">Indeed, I would draw the Chair's attention to clause 144 of Ways and Means Motion No. 19 that makes coordinating provisions if each is enacted, which demonstrates the government also sees these as identical measures, but what is especially galling is subclause 144(5), “For greater certainty, if this Act receives royal asset then the other Act [Bill C-323] is deemed never to have produced its effects.” The government would prefer to toss my colleague's important bill down the memory hole. That is just shameful.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8066459" data-originallang="en"> Your predecessor, on February 18, 2021, at page 4256 of the Debates, ruled that government Bill <a data-HoCid="10983057" href="/bills/43-2/C-13/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (single event sport betting)">C-13</a> could not be proceeded with further following the House's adoption of Bill <a data-HoCid="10866122" href="/bills/43-2/C-218/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (sports betting)">C-218</a>, citing the rule against anticipation. In so ruling, the Chair said:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8066460" data-originallang="en"> The House is now placed in an unusual situation where a decision was made on one of two very similar bills standing on the Order Paper. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8066461" data-originallang="en"> The Chair recognizes that both bills are not identical; they are, however, substantially similar as they both amend the exact same provision of the Criminal Code for similar purposes.... </p>
<p data-HoCid="8066462" data-originallang="en"> Consequently, as long as Bill <a data-HoCid="10866122" href="/bills/43-2/C-218/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (sports betting)">C-218</a> follows its course through the legislative process during this session, Bill <a data-HoCid="10983057" href="/bills/43-2/C-13/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (single event sport betting)">C-13</a> may not be proceeded with. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8066463" data-originallang="en">As for the technical differences between those two bills, the Speaker offered a common-sense solution to reconcile them: “the Chair notes that other avenues would be open to the House to achieve those same ends, such as through amendments proposed to Bill <a data-HoCid="10866122" href="/bills/43-2/C-218/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (sports betting)">C-218</a> during the committee's study.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8066464" data-originallang="en">I would respectfully submit that if the government has any concerns about the drafting of Bill <a data-HoCid="12260777" href="/bills/44-1/C-318/" title="An Act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and the Canada Labour Code (adoptive and intended parents)">C-318</a> or Bill <a data-HoCid="12260850" href="/bills/44-1/C-323/" title="An Act to amend the Excise Tax Act (mental health services)">C-323</a>, the solution is to bring amendments to committee, not to bigfoot them by throwing them into an omnibus budget bill, but that is exactly what happened here. It is what happened last year when Bill <a data-HoCid="11535416" href="/bills/44-1/C-250/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (prohibition — promotion of antisemitism)">C-250</a>, sponsored by the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278477" href="/politicians/kevin-waugh/" title="Kevin Waugh">Saskatoon—Grasswood</a>, was scooped up by the government and placed in Bill <a data-HoCid="11719486" href="/bills/44-1/C-19/" title="An Act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on April 7, 2022 and other measures">C-19</a>, a budget implementation bill.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8066465" data-originallang="en"> In a May 11, 2022, ruling at page 5123 of the Debates, the <a data-HoCid="279182" href="/politicians/chris-dentremont/" title="Chris d'Entremont">Deputy Speaker</a> held:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8066466" data-originallang="en"> Bill <a data-HoCid="11719486" href="/bills/44-1/C-19/" title="An Act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on April 7, 2022 and other measures">C-19</a> was adopted at second reading and referred to the Standing Committee on Finance yesterday. The House is now placed in a situation where a decision was made on one of the two bills that contain very similar provisions.... </p>
<p data-HoCid="8066467" data-originallang="en"> The Chair recognizes that these bills are not identical, as Bill <a data-HoCid="11719486" href="/bills/44-1/C-19/" title="An Act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on April 7, 2022 and other measures">C-19</a> is much broader in scope and contains other provisions related to the implementation of the budget. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8066468" data-originallang="en"> However, in adopting Bill <a data-HoCid="11719486" href="/bills/44-1/C-19/" title="An Act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on April 7, 2022 and other measures">C-19</a> at second reading, the House has also agreed to the principle of that bill, and consequently, has agreed, among other things, to amend section 319 of the Criminal Code dealing with hate propaganda. As I explained a few moments ago, these are provisions substantially similar to the ones contained in Bill <a data-HoCid="11535416" href="/bills/44-1/C-250/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (prohibition — promotion of antisemitism)">C-250</a>. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8066469" data-originallang="en"> Therefore, the question for the Chair is, should Bill <a data-HoCid="11535416" href="/bills/44-1/C-250/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (prohibition — promotion of antisemitism)">C-250</a> be allowed to proceed further in the legislative process at this time? In the Chair's opinion, it should not be allowed. The House should not face a situation where the same question can be cited twice within the same session, unless the House's intention is to rescind or revoke the decision. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8066470" data-originallang="en">In the case of Bill <a data-HoCid="11535416" href="/bills/44-1/C-250/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (prohibition — promotion of antisemitism)">C-250</a>, the <a data-HoCid="279182" href="/politicians/chris-dentremont/" title="Chris d'Entremont">Deputy Speaker</a> directed that it be held as pending business until the final fate of Bill <a data-HoCid="11719486" href="/bills/44-1/C-19/" title="An Act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on April 7, 2022 and other measures">C-19</a> could be determined. On September 20, 2022, your predecessor ordered Bill C-250 to be discharged and dropped from the Order Paper, given that Bill C-19 had by then received royal assent. A similar pair of rulings occurred on June 6, 2022, and May 11, 2023, in respect of Bill <a data-HoCid="11541330" href="/bills/44-1/C-243/" title="An Act respecting the elimination of the use of forced labour and child labour in supply chains">C-243</a> in light of its overlap with Senate Bill <a data-HoCid="11474494" href="/bills/44-1/S-211/" title="An Act to enact the Fighting Against Forced Labour and Child Labour in Supply Chains Act and to amend the Customs Tariff">S-211</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8066471" data-originallang="en">While these rulings are all quite recent, they were not novel. Speaker Michener, on March 13, 1959, at page 238 of the Journals, reached the same conclusion for managing this sort of legislative traffic jam:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8066472" data-originallang="en"> Thus I have come to the conclusion that this bill must stand, as well as the other bill in the same terms, or at least in terms for exactly the same purpose, until the bill which was first moved has been disposed of either by being withdrawn, which would open the door for one of these other bills to proceed, or by way of being approved, which would automatically dispose of these bills because the House would not vote twice on the same subject matter any more than it would debate the same subject matter twice. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8066473" data-originallang="en"> Standing Order 94(1) empowers and directs the Speaker to, “make all arrangements necessary to ensure the orderly conduct of Private Members’ Business”. That standing order, I would submit, behooves you to safeguard the process of Private Members' Business as much as possible by drawing a firm and bright line for the government to stop poaching common-sense Conservative bills and claiming them as their own.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8066474" data-originallang="en">One final consideration I want to place before the Chair is one that did not arise in the context of the pairs of bills and the precedents I have cited. We are dealing here with a ways and means motion, not a bill. Bosc and Gagnon, at page 568, explain the relevance of this distinction in the role against anticipation:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8066475" data-originallang="en"> According to this rule, which applied to other proceedings as well as to motions, a motion could not anticipate a matter which was standing on the Order Paper for further discussion, whether as a bill or a motion, and which was contained in a more effective form of proceeding. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8066476" data-originallang="en">The associated footnote points readers to other authorities for a fuller explanation, such as the U.K.'s Erskine May. That book's 25th edition, at paragraph 20.13, explains:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8066477" data-originallang="en"> ...a matter must not be anticipated if contained in a more effective form of proceeding than the proceeding by which it was sought to be anticipated, but it might be anticipated if contained in an equally or less effective form. A bill or other order of the day is more effective than a motion.... </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8066478" data-originallang="en">This principle was explained matter-of-factly by Speaker Casgrain on February 24, 1936, at page 68 of the Journals: “A Bill has the right-of-way and cannot be sidetracked by a Motion.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8066479" data-originallang="en">In the circumstances, if the precedents and procedural authorities of this House are to be applied consistently, Ways and Means Motion No. 19 must be put into abeyance pending the outcome of Bill <a data-HoCid="12260777" href="/bills/44-1/C-318/" title="An Act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and the Canada Labour Code (adoptive and intended parents)">C-318</a> and Bill <a data-HoCid="12260850" href="/bills/44-1/C-323/" title="An Act to amend the Excise Tax Act (mental health services)">C-323</a>. I would urge you, Madam Speaker, to so rule.</p>
