<p data-HoCid="6190581" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6190582" data-originallang="en">Through you to the Prime Minister, there is a pattern in history of leaders sometimes using a crisis that absorbs people's attention to do things they otherwise might not do for fear of global condemnation, such as in a pandemic. We see President Bolsonaro of Brazil turning more brutality against indigenous people in the Amazon.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6190583" data-originallang="en">My questions focus on the People's Republic of China, which I think is doing the same thing, and on Prime Minister Netanyahu in Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6190584" data-originallang="en">To the question of China, we now see the People's Republic of China cracking down in Hong Kong in ways that violate the commitment to one country, two systems.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6190585" data-originallang="en">What will the Government of Canada do to help Canadian citizens, even if they are dual citizens of the People's Republic, to get home to Canada?</p>
