<p data-HoCid="8714690" data-originallang="en"> I don't expect you to know by heart, but if you're able to send back to the committee the list of countries that have either officially recognized the State of Palestine or are currently contemplating or considering it, I would appreciate that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714691" data-originallang="en">I have another question for you. We know that Norway, Ireland and Spain recently announced it. Can you tell the committee how they manifested that recognition? What steps did they take after making that political decision?</p>
