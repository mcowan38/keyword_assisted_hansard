<p data-HoCid="8653028" data-originallang="fr">Our approach to ethnic origin or race really falls along the same lines. We're seeing this in women of African descent. Researchers are beginning to identify a genetic predisposition to breast cancer, as is the case for women of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. This could be a risk factor. As Ms. Ippersiel explained, there really is a movement to take much more targeted approaches to breast cancer screening. Breast cancer has a whole range of risk factors. This could mean starting screening earlier. A number of specialists are coming to a useful consensus.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8653029" data-originallang="fr">I also encourage you to look at the analysis of the Toronto‑based Rethink Breast Cancer. This group works with women and people under the age of 50 who have breast cancer, people who have metastatic cancer and marginalized groups. Its position is extremely sound. This organization isn't in favour of screening for breast cancer starting at age 40. Instead, it advocates for a more targeted approach to screening, based on a range of risk factors.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8653030" data-originallang="fr"> The perspectives are somewhat limited in the information sessions. A wider range of people are asking perfectly legitimate questions about the benefits of expanding breast cancer screening to include women aged 40 to 49, in comparison with other approaches. It's challenging. We aren't experts. However, we should listen to a range of experts on this topic.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8653031" data-originallang="fr">Ethnic origin—for example in the case of first nations women, black women and perhaps other groups—may involve specific risk factors for these women.</p>
