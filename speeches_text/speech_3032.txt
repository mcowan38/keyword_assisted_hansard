<p data-HoCid="8010057" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, Canadians are witnessing the glorification of terrorism and incitement of hatred against the Jewish community at pro-Hamas terror rallies across our country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8010058" data-originallang="en"> At a Queen's Park rally in Toronto, genocidal slogans called for violent acts against innocent civilians. B'nai Brith has reported these rallies that support a listed terrorist organization.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8010059" data-originallang="en"> Why has the <a data-HoCid="299999" href="/politicians/arif-virani/" title="Arif Virani">Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada</a> been silent on such grotesque displays of anti-Semitism and incitement? Has he asked his provincial and territorial counterparts to enforce Canada's hate propaganda laws? Canadians believe in the rule of law, not in mob rule.</p>
