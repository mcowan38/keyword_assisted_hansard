We're seeing some positive elements in an increase in the mobilization of human rights defenders, in the use of social media to promote human rights and in the use of investigative technology to document those abuses.

It's a really worrying trend, because it's a new tool that can be used by both democracies and non-democracies, and misused in very harmful ways.</p>
