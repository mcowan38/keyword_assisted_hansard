Only in the last several decades has the duty to consult been grabbing at better footing in this country. When you start to translate free and prior consent, let's understand really clearly what is actually.... </p>
<p data-HoCid="6639615" data-originallang="en">I deal with industry a lot. We're very strong economic thinkers in the MÃ©tis nation. I meet with Enbridge, for example, every second month. The president and I have a discussion on the future and on how our relationship looks. We have that relationship. What we make very clear is that these types of bills, like this particular one, are setting the blueprint for us on how we come together, how we quit fighting in the courts and how we quit holding up production and opportunity. In Manitoba, for example, our mining institutions have gone down. They should be going up. There should be more investment. If you're shy to come and invest because you don't know what will happen to your investments, you won't come knocking on the door of a province in western Canada, for example. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6639616" data-originallang="en">I think these two will work together. There will be a lot of clarity between the two. I think one of the strongest issues you have as a Conservative is the issue of veto. I am making it very clear, right here before you, before this country, that this is not a veto. You can take that to any courtroom. This is not a veto for indigenous people. It's a blueprint between us, industry and government. We should have done it 20 years ago or 50 years ago. We'd have been further ahead in this country, beyond anybody else. </p>
