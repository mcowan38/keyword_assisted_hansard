<p data-HoCid="8581075" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> for the work that she has done to lift indigenous women out of poverty.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8581076" data-originallang="en">I mentioned earlier that the Liberals' choices on income supports for Canadians are killing people. We know this is true for murdered and missing indigenous women and girls, and the Liberals still continue to do nothing on the calls for justice.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8581077" data-originallang="en">What the Liberals need to do is start supporting people who are not their rich CEO friends with every kind of support that is available in Canada.</p>
