<p data-HoCid="8793958" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8793959" data-originallang="fr">I'd like to thank the witnesses for being with us today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8793960" data-originallang="fr">Professor Potvin, Professor Gaudreault‑DesBiens and Professor Lefebvre, we are pleased to have you here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8793961" data-originallang="fr">I think you were a major piece of the puzzle we are dealing with in our study on freedom of expression. I'm very pleased that you agreed to join us.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8793962" data-originallang="fr">Mrs. Lefebvre, in your opening remarks earlier, you stated that you support the bill to repeal section 319 and remove the religious exemption.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8793963" data-originallang="fr">I'm very happy to hear that, Mrs. Lefebvre. I think there is a general consensus on that in Quebec society.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8793964" data-originallang="fr">Today, on behalf of the Bloc Québécois, I tried to move a motion for the unanimous consent of the parties in the House of Commons.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8793965" data-originallang="fr">I would like to read it to you, and I would like your comments on it. The motion reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8793966" data-originallang="fr"> That the House affirm that no hate speech is tolerated in Canada; That it deplore the religious exemption provided for in paragraphs 319(3)(b) and 319(3.1)(b) of the Criminal Code on hate speech; That it deplore the fact that the religious exemption provides a legal shield for radical extremists to encourage hatred and intolerance towards ethnic or religious groups or to disseminate racist, misogynistic or homophobic speech; That the House support the urgent need to repeal paragraphs 319(3)(b) and 319(3.1)(b) of the Criminal Code in order to ensure the full application of legal protections against hate speech to all citizens of Quebec and Canada, as provided for in Bill <a data-HoCid="12830843" href="/bills/44-1/C-373/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (promotion of hatred or antisemitism)">C‑373</a>, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (promotion of hatred or antisemitism). </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8793967" data-originallang="fr">Do you think the motion is reasonable? Parties in the House opposed it and even prevented me from reading it today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8793968" data-originallang="fr">I'd like your opinion on that.</p>
