<p data-HoCid="8009840" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, for the last 30 days, I have been listening to and consoling residents in Mississaugaâ€”Erin Mills and across Canada for the deaths of thousands of innocent Palestinians and Israelis. I really join them in their pain, their grief and their calls to action in the chamber. Parents are having to explain to their kids why they are seeing death and horror in their social media feeds. There are children too afraid to wear religious symbols at school. There are neighbours grieving the deaths of loved ones who lived in the region, and they feel silenced from publicizing their pain. There are also faith leaders fearing for the safety of congregations and asking police to stand watch while they pray.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8009841" data-originallang="en">I hear the calls from Canadians for a humanitarian ceasefire, the release of civilian hostages and a dedicated humanitarian corridor. We must work harder to achieve a just and lasting peace for all Palestinians and Israelis for the sake of humanity.</p>
