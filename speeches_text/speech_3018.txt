<p data-HoCid="8002555" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I urge the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> to call for a ceasefire in Israel and Palestine. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8002556" data-originallang="en">We must condemn the horrific killing of Israelis by Hamas and the taking of hostages. We must condemn Israel's relentless killing of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, including over 3,000 children. UNICEF has said that Gaza has become a graveyard for children.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8002557" data-originallang="en">Let me be clear. Canada is complicit. Canada's arms exports to Israel are at record high levels, with over $20 million exported last year. A significant percentage of our exports include explosives and components related to military aircraft. There is the risk that they have been used in the bombings of refugee camps, hospitals and the killing of entire families.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8002558" data-originallang="en">Canada used to be a leader for peace, in Sinai, in Cyprus and at the UN. We need to be that voice for peace now more than ever. I urge the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> to call for a ceasefire, for the freeing of hostages, for immediate humanitarian aid and for a two-state solution, with peace and security, including the end of the occupation and a just peace for Palestinians.</p>
