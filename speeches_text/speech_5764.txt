<p data-HoCid="8774592" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Chair, I would like you to enlighten me on the agenda for Thursday.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8774593" data-originallang="fr">According to the schedule, we should be undertaking the study on Latin America. The problem is that we don't have a work plan. I don't know what stage we're at with the Iran report. I think, in the case of this report, that our instructions have not even been given to our analysts. I also don't know what's happening with the report on Palestine.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8774594" data-originallang="fr"> I'm a bit confused regarding what's scheduled for Thursday.</p>
