<p data-HoCid="8779303" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, as I have now outlined, before I was rudely interrupted, not only did I not breach the member's privilege but I was not even present at the event that she alleges to have taken place. It is an extremely serious accusation from the member for <a data-HoCid="278731" href="/politicians/melissa-lantsman/" title="Melissa Lantsman">Thornhill</a> to allege that I breached her parliamentary privilege when I was not even present, and I find it deeply hurtful and problematic that a member can make such an accusation and provide disinformation to the House against a fellow member without a shred of evidence.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8779304" data-originallang="en">I hope that the <a data-HoCid="278731" href="/politicians/melissa-lantsman/" title="Melissa Lantsman">member</a>, Jew to Jew, apologizes for likening another Jew in the House to a terrorist. I welcome her apology, even if it is in private. </p>
