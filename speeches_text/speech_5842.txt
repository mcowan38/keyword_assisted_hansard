<p data-HoCid="8813181" data-originallang="en">Ambassador Rae, you mentioned Gaza as well as a series of other issues with respect to the forced migration refugee crisis. When we think about these types of issues, as you well know, disputed borders, international laws, compacts between countries and negotiations all compel a refugee and migration crisis, in large part. At the United Nations, you voted initially, on behalf of this government, against Israel, and in a hot mic moment, you got caught saying, “We’ll see how that flies.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8813182" data-originallang="en">Let me ask you this: How has it been flying? </p>
