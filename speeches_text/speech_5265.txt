<p data-HoCid="8693578" data-originallang="en">Support in Israel for a two-state solution has fallen over the years, and especially since October 7. Part of the reason is that on October 7, Hamas murdered many of the supporters of a two-state solution. Many of the victims of the massacre were peace activists who would drive Palestinian children to hospitals in Israel. They were burned alive on October 7. Israelis have unfortunately come to the conclusion that any territorial withdrawal would lead to the creation of another Iranian puppet state, and that a withdrawal, far from advancing the cause of peace, would in fact serve as a possibility for the Palestinians to use a springboard towards their ultimate goal of the destruction of the State of Israel. </p>

I would hope thatâ€”</p>
