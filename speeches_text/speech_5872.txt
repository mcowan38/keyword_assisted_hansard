<p data-HoCid="8824581" data-originallang="en">I want to thank our witnesses for their time, for being flexible and for all their testimony. If there is something you wanted to share with the committee that you weren't able to, please submit that in writing at your earliest convenience, as we're going to get into writing a report very soon based on what we've heard. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8824582" data-originallang="en">With that, I just want to again say thank you very much. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8824583" data-originallang="en">We are briefly going to suspend as we welcome our next panel.</p>
