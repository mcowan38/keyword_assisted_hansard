<p data-HoCid="7345511" data-originallang="fr">Minister, you are not answering my question. I want to know if, in the training you give on anti-racism and anti-Semitism, there is a section on francophobia.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345512" data-originallang="fr">We see that this phenomenon is percolating more and more, we see it in social media. Nowhere in your program is there any mention of the hateful comments made towards francophones.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345513" data-originallang="fr">My question is simple, Minister: does the training address this problem?</p>
