<p data-HoCid="8691842" data-originallang="en"> Madam Chair, we can get back to the order of things that we're discussing, including the study on anti-Semitism, within minutes if we pass this motion. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8691843" data-originallang="en">We have clear agreement from the other side that they want <a data-HoCid="278476" href="/politicians/arnold-viersen/" title="Arnold Viersen">Mr. Viersen</a> to be here. We're simply allowing for an extension of time to accommodate what obviously is a very busy schedule. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8691844" data-originallang="en">We don't need to debate this motion. It's a yes or no. We can get on with it and get back to the business at hand, so if there's any further discussion on this, I can only interpret it as an attempt to prevent Mr. Viersen from attending this committee, because there's no other way to look at it.</p>
