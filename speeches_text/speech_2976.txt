<p data-HoCid="8028010" data-originallang="en">When an article is written blaming Israel for an air strike it did not commit, and this has been confirmed by countries around the world and intelligence agencies from around the world, and the CBC still insists that it stands behind that article professing that the attack did come from Israel, that is, in fact, the spreading of dangerous disinformation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8028011" data-originallang="en">We are inviting you, Ms. Tait, through the chair, to offer an apology to the Jewish population in Canada, and I daresay to all Canadians, because they have $1.4 billion invested in this public broadcaster. You are right: They do depend on you to tell the truth. When the truth is not told, when a mistruth is spoken, when disinformation is spread, especially dangerous disinformation like this, an apology seems rightâ€”if not an apology, then, at a bare minimum, a correction. Neither of those things has happened.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8028012" data-originallang="en">Again, would you apologize to the Jewish population and all Canadians?</p>
