<p data-HoCid="7494272" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, yes, I will fully commit to working with the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>. I mentioned I do feel her expertise is unmatched in this House. I know there are other colleagues in the NDP and other members in the House who are indigenous. I do not want to take anything away from their experience and expertise. However, I know she has dedicated her life to learning, advocating and fighting for indigenous women and girls, and for indigenous communities across Canada in general.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7494273" data-originallang="en">I would be honoured to work with her and work together to find solutions we can all agree on, implement and see change hopefully within the next few years. I would love not to have this same debate over and over. Next time, we could be talking about the great progress we are making. That would be wonderful. If we can do that, I am game for that.</p>
