<p data-HoCid="8301113" data-originallang="en">Yes, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301114" data-originallang="en">I recognize that Islamophobia is certainly continuing to be an issue in the country, but I would like to just point out that there was a significant study on it after M-103. The Senate also completed a study. The Canadian government did a summit with many recommendations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301115" data-originallang="en">At the same time, I don't want to exclude other religions. We know there have been 80 Christian churches torched, pastors locked up without bail. The Hindu community has reached out to me to let me understand that they are receiving hate speech and death threats.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301116" data-originallang="en">So, while all religions appear to be under attack, I don't want to dilute Mr. Housefather's original motion that talks about the crisis we're facing right now with the rise of anti-Semitism. You know, it's rising by as much as 700% in some places. There are violent crimes; people are unsafe.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301117" data-originallang="en">I'll defer to the will of the committee, but I do think that has to be the priority.</p>
