<p data-HoCid="7727715" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much, Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7727716" data-originallang="en">I too want to speak to this amendment and in support of this. Looking at the amendment, it says “regardless of the provider”. I have met with many new Canadians who have come to Canada and who rely heavily on their ethnic community, whether that's grandparents, friends or family from where they're from. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7727717" data-originallang="en">Also, in a rural aspect as well, I think it's important to note that not every community, especially in rural Canada, has access to day care or to a day care facility. I know that a lot of families in my communities are using home-based child care, with nannies, shared nannies and au pairs. I have communities in my riding that have au pairs from Europe.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7727718" data-originallang="en">The end half of this says, “that meet or exceed standards set by provincial governments or Indigenous governing bodies”. As Ms. Ferreri has said as well, we heard a very compelling argument earlier from MP Gazan when it comes to indigenous women and children. She said herself that any parent wants, in her terms, free, prior and informed consent, but being able to have that opinion and be included....</p>
<p data-HoCid="7727719" data-originallang="en"> I just really hope that the members of the other parties really seriously consider this and the fact that there's a lack of spaces in the country as it is. There are rural parts of this country that don't have access to an urban centre that may offer a program that is approved by the federal government under this layout. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7727720" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
