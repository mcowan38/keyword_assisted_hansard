<p data-HoCid="6444309" data-originallang="en">That's no problem. Thank you, Mr. Dreeshen.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6444310" data-originallang="en">I have one more question. I'd like to finish off with Ms. Nicholls, where I wanted to finish off last time but ran out of time. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6444311" data-originallang="en">You talked about our need to highlight the bioeconomy. I think some of us understand the bioeconomyâ€”or at least what I see. We use this wood waste from mills. We see as an example in Prince George where wood waste is used to heat basically all the municipal buildings downtown. That is the most obvious example of that bioeconomy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6444312" data-originallang="en">There has to be a larger understanding of this, and maybe I'm grabbing onto it. I see a lot more potential there. My son works in the forest sector and he's been part of dealing with burn piles before and all that wood that just seems to be, again, going up in smoke when it could be used in other ways. The cost-effectiveness is the biggest challenge, isn't it? Some of these areas are remote, and how do we get that in a cost-effective way to utilize this?</p>
<p data-HoCid="6444313" data-originallang="en">Maybe just expand on what bioeconomy means for the room here. Most of us might not have a full understanding of that term. </p>
