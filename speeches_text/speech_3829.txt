<p data-HoCid="8302907" data-originallang="en">My first question will be to Mr. Michalchyshyn. We've spoken many times before. You know I've been to large Ukrainian churches all across Canada for CUAET visa holders, and I've been meeting with lots of people in the evenings to talk to the Ukrainian community. However, I was going to ask you how we move forward from here in order to avoid events and disagreements among the diaspora communities in Canada that are at stake here. Three of them have an interest in how history is interpreted, namely the Jewish community in Canada, the Ukrainian diaspora and the Polish diasporaâ€”my last name gives it away. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8302908" data-originallang="en">How do we move forward from here so the events that happened here are not used by the Russian Federation to further its propaganda campaign in this war that's happening right now in the territory of Ukraine?</p>
