<p data-HoCid="8703068" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to thank our witnesses for being here and for their testimony.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703069" data-originallang="en">Mr. Fogel, I want to follow up on something you said. You said the Palestinians are not entitled to a Palestinian state. I'm curious to know, in your opinion, what they are entitled to, those stateless millions of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. Are they entitled to something?</p>
