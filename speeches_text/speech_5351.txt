<p data-HoCid="8668919" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, I am really glad my colleague talked about outsourcing and highly paid consultants, something the NDP has been deeply concerned about dating back to the Harper government. Outsourcing doubled under the Harper government. It has actually quadrupled under the Liberal government.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8668920" data-originallang="en">One thing we have been trying to do as New Democrats is take a real look at companies like Deloitte, for example. It is the highest paid beneficiary in all of external consulting. The Conservatives, who run the government operations committee through the chair and their members, have not allowed OGGO to study and take a close examination of Deloitte despite many requests by the New Democrats.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8668921" data-originallang="en">It is no surprise that the Liberals do not want to look at it, but I will note that former cabinet minister Pierre Pettigrew and former Conservative cabinet minister Peter MacKay sit as managing directors of Deloitte. It is no surprise why the Conservatives do not want to take up a closer examination of Deloitte. They want to talk about McKinsey in their rabbit hole chase, but they do not want to look at Deloitte.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8668922" data-originallang="en">Will my colleague tell us when the Conservatives are going to open up the books on Deloitte and take a hard look at it? Why is Deloitte getting such an obscene number of outsourced contracts from Canadian taxpayers?</p>
