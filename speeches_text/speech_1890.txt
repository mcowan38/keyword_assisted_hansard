<p data-HoCid="7346034" data-originallang="en">I'm going to be voting against the amendment, and I'm going to be voting against the motion, because it's profoundly disrespectful to members of this committee. The Conservatives have done this twice. Twice I've said to them, let's have this first hearing, let's get the answers, and then we can come back. I've been open to the consideration.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7346035" data-originallang="en"> For the Conservatives to be so disrespectful, so childish, in how they are approaching an issue that is so fundamental.... When we see a growth in hate, when we see a growth in anti-Semitism, instead of dealing with that issue seriously we have this childish temper tantrum and filibuster that does not allow the community to be reassured that we're getting the answers that are required. I'm quite frustrated, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7346036" data-originallang="en"> I don't know if it's because of the embarrassment that the <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">leader of the official opposition</a> experienced with this vile connection to this misogynistic group, and this is some kind of smoke screen. I don't know. But I find it distasteful and showing appallingly bad judgment that this hearing was sabotaged and now we will have to reconvene in two weeks to finally get the ministerial officials to answer the important questions we have. I have a ton of them, and I wasn't able to ask them today because of this childish filibuster.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7346037" data-originallang="en"> I just find it extremely regrettable, and for those Canadians who are listening and those Canadians from the Jewish community and francophone Canadians who are listening in, I don't know what to say. I cannot understand the bad, poor, childish judgment of this Conservative Party under the new Conservative leader.</p>
