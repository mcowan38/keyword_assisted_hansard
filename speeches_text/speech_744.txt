<p data-HoCid="6554281" data-originallang="fr">It's certainly a challenge, given that science is being carried out in real time now. Usually, clinical trials for a vaccine take about 10 years. In this case, the whole process was condensed into one year given the urgency of the situation. All the usual developments are visible to everyone and give rise to misunderstandings. That's why, as I said earlier, the institutions that make the decisions should at least join forces and deliver a consolidated message.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6554282" data-originallang="fr">In terms of vaccinations, unfortunately we're behind other countries. We should use this delay to our advantage by studying the situation on the ground. We have access to data from Israel and the United Kingdom. Our institutions, Health Canada and the National Advisory Committee on Immunization, or NACI, should be using the data, working together, and possibly conducting reviews every two weeks or every month.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6554283" data-originallang="fr">However, the message should be consolidated and should originate entirely from the same organization. There should be a consensus based on the field data. We should take the time to analyze the data properly, rather than releasing it daily or weekly, and to conduct reviews every two weeks or every month.</p>
