<p data-HoCid="7956531" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, Alexandre Look, Ben Mizrachi, Adi Vital-Kaploun, Shir Hana Georgy, Netta Epstein and Judith Haggai are six Canadians who were brutally murdered in the war launched by the terrorist group Hamas against our friend and ally, Israel. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7956532" data-originallang="en">There are over 1,400 dead, scenes of sickening brutality, infants slaughtered and elderly survivors of the Holocaust butchered. Innocent civilians, Israelis, Americans and Canadians had their lives ended or forever changed simply because they were Jews. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7956533" data-originallang="en">I feel for the hostages being held in Gaza whose fate is unknown and the innocent Palestinian civilians who suffer because of Hamas. Yet, there are pro-Hamas demonstrations in our own country celebrating this depravity. I hope the entire House joins me in denouncing those who are celebrating the death of innocent Israelis and those who are inciting violence against Jewish Canadians. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7956534" data-originallang="en">My heart is broken. I am devastated. I stand with our ally Israel. I stand with the people of Israel. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7956535" data-originallang="en"> <em>Am Yisrael Chai.</em> </p>
