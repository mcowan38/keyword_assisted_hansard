<p data-HoCid="6940207" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I want to thank the member for his speech and for sharing our desire to quickly address the mistake the government made. It knew about this back in May of 2021, and seniors have suffered because of the delay. I also thank him for his comments on how seniors need supports more broadly and his support for the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>'s bill on a guaranteed basic income.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6940208" data-originallang="en">Seniors are living in poverty. Could the member speak to what a guaranteed basic income would mean for the residents in his riding?</p>
