<p data-HoCid="7797350" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7797351" data-originallang="en">Obviously, I have some concerns with the use of the words “West Bank and Gaza” instead of “Palestine” or “occupied Palestinian territory”. I think it's clear that the United Nations uses the term “occupied Palestinian territory”. Many Palestinians have told me that they have expressed that there is a feeling among the Palestinian community that this government is trying to erase their reality and erase the reality of the Palestinian people. I think it's important that we use accurate language and that the “Palestinian people” or the “occupied Palestinian territory” be used instead.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7797352" data-originallang="en">That said, I think this is a vitally important study. I think we will be bringing forward witnesses who will speak about the reality of people both in Israel and Palestine. I think the fact that this foreign affairs committee has not studied this for many years, if not decades, and that Canada does have an important role to play.... The attacks on Israeli and Palestinian civilians, particularly on children, is so appalling that, as a foreign affairs committee, we have an obligation to look at this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7797353" data-originallang="en">While I am concerned by that amendment, I think it is more important for us to get the study and get the witnesses to this committee to talk about what Canada can do to ensure peace in the region.</p>
