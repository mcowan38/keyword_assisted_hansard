<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the nightmare in Gaza continues.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Over 33,000 Palestinians have been killed, including over 14,500 children. Families have gathered for Eid. They have gathered in the rubble, hungry, and mourning their loved ones who have been killed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Just last week, we were horrified by Israel's killing of seven workers with World Central Kitchen, including one Canadian. More than 200 aid workers have been killed by Israel. It is clear that the Netanyahu far right government will continue the killing, in large part because of the complicity and the empty words of countries like ours.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">We are witnessing a dystopian nightmare that is all too real, with AI drones and cold-blooded calculations of how many innocent civilians it is okay to kill at one time. We now hear that former prime minister Stephen Harper heads up one of the AI firms used by Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">We are also hearing about Canadian tax-deductible charities that are fuelling the war on Gaza. Canada must end its complicity on all fronts. It starts with recognizing Palestine as a state, including full membership at the UN, bringing in a real two-way arms embargo. It means taking a stand against genocide and standing up for peace and justice.</p>
