<p data-HoCid="7168274" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7168275" data-originallang="en">Thank you to all of our witnesses for helping guide our committee through this study. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7168276" data-originallang="en">Mr. Aziz, I would like to turn to you for my first question, if I can. I was present as a member of Parliament in the 42nd Parliament, and I remember the furor over the debate involving motion 103, which was using the term “Islamophobia” and calling it out for what it is. It always struck me as very strange that we have a general acceptance of what the term “anti-Semitism” means, but the word “Islamophobia” created just such an uproar and furor. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7168277" data-originallang="en">I guess what I want to know from you, sir, is what the legacy has been of that very charged debate on Islamophobia for the Muslim community. Where are we at now in the years that have passed since that debate?</p>
