<p data-HoCid="6791871" data-originallang="en">That's a very good question. There are those who will say that the two-state solution is a dream that wasn't realized and a number of Palestinians have lost faith in the prospect of it. Certainly what has been happening on the ground with settlements, with evictions and with demolitions, has made it much more difficult to come to ground and to work towards a two-state solution.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791872" data-originallang="en">However, if you take a step back and consider it, if the ultimate goal is that Israelis and Palestinians can live together in a secure environment, this is the path. The only way we're going to get there is if we sit down and investigate. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6791873" data-originallang="en">In terms of the land, the borders, those are issues that need to be worked out in the ultimate negotiation, so that we can get to a place where you have a viable Palestinian state. They both want to be secure. Neither side is going anywhere, so we need to work towards a two-state solution.</p>
