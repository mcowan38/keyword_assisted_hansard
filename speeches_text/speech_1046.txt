<p data-HoCid="6756225" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, I would like to ask some questions to the <a data-HoCid="271244" href="/politicians/marc-garneau/" title="Marc Garneau">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> on some significant matters, starting with what has arisen in the Middle East with Israel and Palestine in the last number of weeks, where there has been serious escalation. The government put out a statement saying that Canada will always stand ready to support efforts for a two-state solution.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6756226" data-originallang="en">Does the <a data-HoCid="271244" href="/politicians/marc-garneau/" title="Marc Garneau">minister</a> not agree Canada needs to do more than just stand by and we need to actually take action and have an active approach to provide pressure and build the foundations for peace between Israel and Palestine?</p>
