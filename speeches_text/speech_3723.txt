<p data-HoCid="8265192" data-originallang="en">Senator Harder, unfortunately my answer will not be a very positive one. What we have seen in the last two years is an increase in violent extremism in our country, motivated both by ideology and by religious motives. That has accelerated, also, since October 7, with the attack by Hamas on Israel. Unfortunately, here in Ottawa, we've had a terrorist plot, which was thwarted because of the work of CSIS and the RCMP.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8265193" data-originallang="en">From an extremism point of view, we have seen a rise in religiously motivated violent extremism. We have also seen what was the concern during the convoyâ€”the ideological motivation continued to increase in terms of anti-government motivation. We have seen an increase in that. We have seen people who have continued to engage in planning, in prepping for activities, doing military-type drills.</p>
