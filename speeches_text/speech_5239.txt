<p data-HoCid="8688981" data-originallang="en"> I asked a similar thing the other day, because I find that what's concerning is that the Conservatives keep going down into very paranoid rabbit holes and making claims that have nothing to do with the subject at hand. Maybe they're playing for the cameras back home, but I think that, as far as our committee goes, it's very important.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8688982" data-originallang="en"> Maybe they aren't and I could be misreading that entirely. If we read the motion and if we were actually talking facts, then I could sit and listen to them all day, but right now I really am wary about having to go down these rabbit holes with them. </p>
