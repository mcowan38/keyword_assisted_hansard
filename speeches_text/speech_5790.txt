<p data-HoCid="8793832" data-originallang="en"> We are also concerned that the newly released IHRA handbook will further erode free expression on Palestine by defining criticism of Israel, which is not prohibited expression, as anti-Semitic, infringing on the free expression rights of Jewish, Palestinian and allied communities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8793833" data-originallang="en"> We call on this committee to recognize anti-Palestinian racism and commit to addressing the discriminatory Palestine exception on expression and the unprecedented repression that advocates for a free Palestine are facing.</p>
