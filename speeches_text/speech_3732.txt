<p data-HoCid="8276042" data-originallang="fr">I would like the member to give us more information on the last part, which aims to recognize Palestine as a state, as several other countries have done. We tabled a motion to that effect a few years ago, but we did not have enough support.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8276043" data-originallang="fr">I would also like the member to tell us about her proposal to try and put an end to the occupation and settlements in Palestine's occupied territories.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8276044" data-originallang="fr">How can recognizing the Palestinian state, as part of a two-state solution, help move towards resolving the conflict?</p>
