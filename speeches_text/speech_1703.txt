<p data-HoCid="7150372" data-originallang="en">This is absolutely something of great concern to the Jewish community, and certainly to Jewish students on campus, also to their parents. Nobody should have to go on a university campus and deal with issues other than getting a great education here in Canada, but unfortunately Jewish students are regularly made to feel unsafe on campus in various ways. It could be through the political process of unions, and there have been updates at McGill since then. This is something we note on campuses across Canada. They contact our organization and other Jewish organizations. Basically, a lot of this comes down to the fact that Jews are often forced to defend themselves in the face of others proposing who and what they are and what they think, because of their connection as Jews to the Jewish state of Israel. “Zionism” is often treated as a dirty term on campus, and because you're Jewish or you appear to be Jewish, you may get treated with different forms of abuse.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7150373" data-originallang="en">In fact, at the University of Toronto, they had a couple of times when student unions would take the position that even kosher food, which is a religious commandment for Jews, should be negatively impacted. It shouldn't be allowed if you hold a certain political ideology, that of Zionism. Of course, more than 90% of Jews in Canada are Zionists. That is the overall connection between our community. It is something that's disturbing. We consider BDS anti-Semitic—</p>
