<p data-HoCid="8482893" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, Canada is a secular country, a secular society. No form of hate speech will be accepted or tolerated. We have always fought against it and that is precisely why we introduced a bill to combat online hate, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and all forms of discrimination because hate, whether online or in the street, hurts individuals and society. I hope that the Bloc Québécois will vote with the government.</p>
