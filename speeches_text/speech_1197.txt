<p data-HoCid="6813936" data-originallang="en">Chair, just like Emmanuella, I want to speak in support of Ms. Damoff's motion. I thank her for actually bringing it forward, because from the testimony we've already heard and from NSICOP's report itself, we already knew that ideologically motivated violent extremism has been growing in Canada and has been getting worse since this pandemic. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6813937" data-originallang="en">Given the horrific terrorist attack motivated by Islamophobia that took place in London over the weekend that destroyed a whole family and has broken the entire Muslim community, I think as leaders the time to act is now. The Muslim community is hurting and so are other communities. I think at this committee we have the ability to act on this very pressing issue and a chance to do something before the House rises. We already know the terrorist attack was part of the larger trend in the rise of IMVE, ideologically motivated violent extremism</p>
<p data-HoCid="6813938" data-originallang="en">I agree with Ms. Damoff's motion that we commit to finishing our study on this to provide the government with recommendations on what needs to be done to ensure that attacks like this do not happen again. It's incumbent upon all of us as elected members, as leaders and as members of this committee, to make that happen, to ensure that all Canadians, whether they're Muslim Canadians, Black Canadians, Asian Canadians, Jewish Canadians, indigenous people or racialized Canadians can feel safe in their homes and their communities. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6813939" data-originallang="en">I really hope that we can move this motion forward and I hope that everyone can support it.</p>
