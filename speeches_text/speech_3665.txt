<p data-HoCid="8276216" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the UN has called for an end of arms sales to the State of Israel. Specifically, it has called out Canada for fuelling this crisis with military trade. The International Court of Justice made a ruling to prevent genocide. For years, New Democrats have called for an arms embargo. We are also calling on the government to do more to stop arms smuggling to Hamas. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8276217" data-originallang="en">The member spoke about the increase in military trade that has happened since this conflict started. It is not enough, as the minister said, to go export permit by export permit. We need an arms embargo. Canada must do more to prioritize human rights, international law and peace for Palestinians and Israelis.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8276218" data-originallang="en"> Could the member speak to how horrific it is that the government is still allowing military trade to the State of Israel?</p>
