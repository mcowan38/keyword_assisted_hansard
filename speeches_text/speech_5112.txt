<p data-HoCid="8663382" data-originallang="fr">The two situations the member just mentioned are comparable in some respects, but there are also some limits.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8663383" data-originallang="fr">It's also important to keep in mind the concept of self-defence. It is entirely legitimate for a country to defend itself against attacks on its territory.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8663384" data-originallang="fr">I'll remind you that Hezbollah, in support of Hamas, launched hundreds of missiles and shells into Israeli territory the very next day, October 8, 2023. A year and a few months later, thousands of shells, missiles and drones have been launched into Israeli territory. That's why I'm saying the two situations are not the same.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8663385" data-originallang="fr">The fact that Israel felt the need to attack positions in southern Lebanon, which the Lebanese armed forces do not control, is part of self-defence. Israel was trying to push back Hezbollah, which poses a constant threat and is preventing the return of 60,000 to 80,000 Israelis living close to the border with Lebanon.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8663386" data-originallang="fr">Now, what the government has pointed out on a number of occasions is that it has to be done with restraint and always with a view to sparing civilians as much as possible. That is one of the messages you've heard repeatedly from the government and in a number of national and multilateral media releases.</p>
