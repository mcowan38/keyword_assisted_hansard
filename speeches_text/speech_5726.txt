<p data-HoCid="8792589" data-originallang="fr">Thank you for your question. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8792590" data-originallang="fr">I can tell you that the Criminal Code provides no definition of what constitutes a hate crime. There's no such thing yet.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8792591" data-originallang="fr">What it does contain are four criminal offences that refer to certain elements. For example, there are advocating genocide, promoting antisemitism and public incitement of hatred, which means generating that energy in a public space. These hate-based motivations under various Criminal Code sections are actually put to good use.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8792592" data-originallang="fr">There's obviously what comes into play once an individual is arrested, tried and convicted. Everything that's a motive for hatred serves as an aggravating factor at sentencing, and that can have an impact on the length of sentence for the individual in question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8792593" data-originallang="fr">I don't have any other available information.</p>
