<p data-HoCid="8387091" data-originallang="en"> Ms. Kwan, if I remember correctly, we had the meeting on March 20. We adopted the motion and then the motion was sent to the department on the 21st. There was some follow-up after that about the Gaza and Sudan motion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8387092" data-originallang="en">The other outstanding motions are also up in the air. I followed up with the department to know the availabilities, not only for Sudan, but for the other motions that were adopted, and I've had no response yet with exactly when the <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">minister</a> is available.</p>
