<p data-HoCid="8454045" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8454046" data-originallang="en">This is about allocation of resources, which include the resources that aren't being allocated to Gaza and Sudan. It's about accountability, Minister. In your own words, “clear and transparent rules”, the quote I read, you're responsible to Parliament. Your intervention under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act is answerable to Parliament, yet here is your response to the question asked of you on this matter on the floor of the House of Commons. You said, “These are not matters we talk about publicly, much less on the floor of the House of Commons.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8454047" data-originallang="en"> Parliamentarians disagree. Your responsibility under section 50 of the IRPA is not a personal right. Maybe you were caught off guard when the question was asked of you in the House of Commons. This is your opportunity today to correct that. Why did you intervene in the deportation order of Mr. Zain Haq?</p>
