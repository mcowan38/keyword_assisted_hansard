<p data-HoCid="8784177" data-originallang="en"> Just looking back a bit on some of the commitments this government has made in terms of a heavy investment in funding a new Holocaust museum in my hometown of Montreal and the appointment of a special envoy on the preservation of Holocaust remembrance, combatting anti-Semitism and other roles, how do you see those sorts of commitments on the part of the government as contributing both to balancing the freedom of expression and to addressing the sharp rise in anti-Semitism and hate that we've seen more widely, in particular over the last year? </p>
