<p data-HoCid="8713790" data-originallang="en">Thank you for that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8713791" data-originallang="en"> I'm asking about this because we've seen an increase in the number of students coming to our country. I think the <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">minister</a> has already admitted that himself. With the SDS program being a fast-tracked way for applicants to come to our country, we are prioritizing speed to accept as many students as possible. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8713792" data-originallang="en">We have a concern about that, because if you recall, last year, in 2023, we let a student into our country who was later charged and arrested for potentially carrying out one of the largest terrorist attacks in our Jewish community. He turned out to be an ISIS supporter and a terrorist, so this information is very important for us to make sure that we're not compromising the security of our country for speed. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8713793" data-originallang="en">If I could get those documents as soon as possible—again I'll ask for those in the next 14 days—that would be helpful for us. Then we can have a discussion on this in a very meaningful manner. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8713794" data-originallang="en">I'm going to switch over to our officials from the IRB, just to get an idea about this from them as well. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8713795" data-originallang="en">The <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">minister</a> recently said there has been a massive increase—an “alarming trend” were his exact words—in the number of international students claiming asylum in our country. How many international students claimed asylum last year?</p>
