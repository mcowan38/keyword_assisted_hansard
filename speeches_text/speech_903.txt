<p data-HoCid="6692434" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6692435" data-originallang="en">It's great to be back. I know we were slightly delayed in getting started today due to PROC, which is the other committee that I am on, but nonetheless, I want to thank Ms. Gazan for showing up at PROC and helping us to secure the time for this meeting today because I am glad to be moving forward with HUMA.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6692436" data-originallang="en">On October 15, 2020, I put a motion on notice to the committee. Most members would have received that. I know it's in our shared box for the committee. I would like to move that motion now as the next order of business that we study. It's a topic that I feel very passionately about, and I have prepared a few remarks to put to the committee as to why I believe this should be the next order of business.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6692437" data-originallang="en">I move:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="6692438" data-originallang="en"> That the committee undertake a study on Social Innovation and Social Finance, outlining how these strategies can contribute to building a more inclusive, resilient, and sustainable economy as we look towards economic recovery, and that this study shall take no less than six meetings. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="6692439" data-originallang="en">That motion, again, was put on notice on October 15, 2020, and it's been sitting there. I know that we've prioritized other business up until now, but I do think that this is an important topic. It's certainly something I feel extremely passionate about, and I would like to make a bit of a plea to the committee as to why I believe this is an important study to undertake as our next order of business.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6692440" data-originallang="en">I'll make those remarks now if that's okay with the chair.</p>
