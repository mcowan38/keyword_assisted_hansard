<p data-HoCid="8524134" data-originallang="en"> I appreciate Mr. Housefather's intervention. He makes a very compelling case to call Mr. Anderson as a witness. That was the intention, yet we end up down these other rabbit holes, so I am for that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8524135" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Chair, I have lost track between the subamendments and amendments. Where are we with that? Have we now, based on the last votes, removed our ability to call any witnesses, and we're now just relying on this, or does that still exist, based on the original motion?</p>
