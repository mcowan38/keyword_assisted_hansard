<p data-HoCid="7952697" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7952698" data-originallang="en">I would like to speak in favour of Mr. Champoux's motion, because the Charter of Rights and Freedoms gives us freedom of thought, expression, opinion and belief. I see in the country an erosion of that right.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7952699" data-originallang="en">Taleeb was talking about what he's seeing in his riding, and certainly there have been comments made that were offensive to Jewish people and to Muslim people. There have also been comments made that are offensive to Christian people, and there have been comments made that are offensive to the LGBTQ and trans communities. There have been offensive comments.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7952700" data-originallang="en">I think we need to be careful and understand the difference between hate speech, which is defined in the Criminal Code as something that would be reasonably expected to incite violence, and offensive speechâ€”somebody who has an opinion that you don't agree with. I certainly find the extreme left opinions very offensive, but it is their right to express them and we've certainly seen violence on that side as well.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7952701" data-originallang="en">I know Mr. Julian loves to talk about the extreme right, but I would say the extreme right and the extreme left are demonstrating similar behaviours. As Canadians, we want people to express their opinions and views in a respectful way without violence.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7952702" data-originallang="en"> I think there's value in this study, because I think something needs to be done to the legislation to take the threshold of hate speech from today, where nobody can really bring a suit on it, to an understanding of what commonly we agree shouldn't be said because it's harmful to communities or whatever. It's a lesser crime, if you will, but we still want to send the message that it shouldn't happen. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7952703" data-originallang="en">I think within this study there is the ability to do that. With the censorship that we've seen increasingly with bills like <a data-HoCid="11528728" href="/bills/44-1/C-11/" title="An Act to amend the Broadcasting Act and to make related and consequential amendments to other Acts">C-11</a>, and even <a data-HoCid="11668222" href="/bills/44-1/C-18/" title="An Act respecting online communications platforms that make news content available to persons in Canada">C-18</a>, people are concerned about the censoring of their freedom of expression, thought, opinion and belief.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7952704" data-originallang="en"> I support this motion.</p>
