<p data-HoCid="6953626" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I am concerned about what I am hearing today from the member of the NDP. It is painting a picture that is inflammatory by implying that the majority of those who are protesting are racists, rather than a few who show their ignorance whenever an opportunity arises.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6953627" data-originallang="en">Personally, I have multiple examples of indigenous, Black, Indian, Muslim, Sikh and Jewish participants who have taken part in this peaceful protest and are proudly talking about it. They are either here to do that or have shared their information after fact-checking what they are hearing from mainstream media and from members in this House.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6953628" data-originallang="en">When did the member personally interact with these individuals who are behaving in the way he is claiming they are?</p>
