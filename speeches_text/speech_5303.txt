<p data-HoCid="8693800" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and thank you to the witnesses for being here today and sharing their expertise with us. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693801" data-originallang="en">I'm going to start with you, Professor Waxman. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693802" data-originallang="en">I appreciate when you said that the most important thing Canada could do to save the two-state solution is recognition of Palestine. I think that's a vital piece of testimony.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693803" data-originallang="en"> I'm also interested in the conversation that is happening in the United States right now regarding American arms sales to Israel. We've seen many experts wondering why the Biden administration is ignoring the Leahy law, which declares that the U.S. cannot arm human rights abusers. It's similar to our Canadian legislation, which our government is also not respecting. We've called for an arms embargo while this genocide continues. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693804" data-originallang="en">I'm wondering if you could talk about where the conversation is in the United States and why that law is not being upheld. </p>
