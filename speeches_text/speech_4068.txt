<p data-HoCid="8396519" data-originallang="en">Now you're talking about the proportion, which one is more and which one is less. I'll turn to the officials for that. All I know is that UNRWA is the backbone of the humanitarian response in Gaza, and we support them fully in that work. They have an extensive history and network. Who delivered what truck and when, I can't answer. That's too granular. Thank you.</p>
