<p data-HoCid="8683676" data-originallang="en"> Yes, I couldn't agree more. These are examples of not only manufactured consent for genocide but also explicit monetary and material support for genocide.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8683677" data-originallang="en">There should most certainly be guardrails for the freedom of expression around manufacturing consent for genocide, as per these two examples that you have given. I would argue that to incite such...to commend the genocidal colonial violence that Israel is committing and to allow that to extend beyond Palestine into Lebanon and into multiple other countries in the region is entirely unbecoming of a Canadian politician.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8683678" data-originallang="en">With regard to the other Canadian politician you mentioned, who is materially aiding Israel in its genocidal campaign against Palestinians.... They most certainly need to be held accountable in both freedom of expression limitations and setting appropriate guardrails, but there also must be accountability around the actual, literal funding and support for a genocide that is unfolding before our eyes and that is before the courts, including the International Court of Justice.</p>
