<p data-HoCid="6893026" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, first of all, we already have some diversity within the office. We did a survey to determine...because it's important to reflect the population of those we serve, MPs and public officials. More and more, it's diversified. We've taken measures, for example, not to correspond with an MP or with a public official when we know it's a religious holiday in his or her religion, as a gesture of respect essentially. The same way we would not send somebody a letter informing them that they will be investigated on December 25, we will not send it on a Sikh holiday or on a Jewish holiday, and such holidays. That's a small thing but it's one example.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6893027" data-originallang="en">I must admit that the member has opened my eyes, however, to the fact that when the definition of family was crafted, it was crafted in 2004 or before, and it does not reflect any attempt to try to reflect the concept of a non-traditional family. That's another area where the committee could look, with our assistance, to see whether we can modernize the definition as well.</p>
