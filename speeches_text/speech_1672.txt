<p data-HoCid="7116912" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, I think those are some of the hardest questions I have been asked in the House of Commons in the last seven years. How do we do something that is so overwhelming?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7116913" data-originallang="en">We talk about elephants, and we talk about one bite at a time. However, I think we have to take direction from indigenous leaders and indigenous communities to say what that first bite is that we need to take. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7116914" data-originallang="en">We know that the government has stated that it is moving forward on things. I know that it is moving slowly, because we hear that. The member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> asked about where the money was, because we are not seeing it allocated.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7116915" data-originallang="en">We need to sit down and be accountable, transparent and do what is right with indigenous leaders. </p>
