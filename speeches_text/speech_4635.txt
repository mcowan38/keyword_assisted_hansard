<p data-HoCid="8465074" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, that is why we would like the bill to go to committee for a thorough study, because it is important in the context of this bill.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8465075" data-originallang="fr">That said, we know that hate crimes are on the rise. We are seeing more and more anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, racism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, and so on. That is why it is important to have clear definitions in the bill.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8465076" data-originallang="fr">At this stage of the bill's consideration, we are being asked to vote on the principle of the bill. The bill seeks to reduce online harm, and we agree with that principle. However, there are still many questions and details to be studied. We will have the opportunity to amend the bill in committee to remove certain parts or add others. There is still a lot of work to be done. The NDP wants to refer the bill to committee so that we can begin that work.</p>
