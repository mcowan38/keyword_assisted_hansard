<p data-HoCid="7280442" data-originallang="en"> Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7280443" data-originallang="en">With your permission, I'll skip ahead various paragraphs, because I think there is relevancy in this document. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7280444" data-originallang="en">A couple of pages talk about Russia's involvement in Ukraine in World War II. I will not comment on that. I will move on to current, 21st-century issues, as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7280445" data-originallang="en"> Putin has referenced Ukrainian nationalists in service of his own political agenda of portraying modern Ukrainians as Nazis. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7280446" data-originallang="en">I've referenced that. The article continues:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7280447" data-originallang="en"> Prior to Russia’s 2014 invasion of Crimea, many Ukrainians viewed Bandera and other freedom fighters in a less favorable light, says [Ms.] Shevel. After, however, she noticed a shift, with these individuals, some of whom fought alongside the Nazis, being called heroes. The Soviets, once held up as liberators from the Nazis, were now the bad guys again. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7280448" data-originallang="en"> Bandera may no longer be [the] official hero of Ukraine, but his memory and that of other 20th-century independence fighters endure. In 2015, Ukraine passed a series of decommunization laws calling for the removal of communist monuments and the renaming of public spaces in honor of Ukrainian nationalists and nationalist organizations, including those known to have participated in the Holocaust. The legislation has received pushback from scholars who see it as whitewashing, or ignoring the dark sides of these movements and their activities. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7280449" data-originallang="en"> Shevel agrees that a complete reversal in framing is “probably not the best outcome.” Although the previous Soviet narrative was very one-sided, she cautions against replacing it with an equally one-sided narrative that labels Ukrainian nationalists unconditional good guys. Either way, Shevel says, the issue is one that should be debated internally, not by a foreign invader: “It’s problematic, but it’s a domestic debate.” </p>
<p data-HoCid="7280450" data-originallang="en"> Dobczansky, for his part, believes Ukraine is entitled to its own version of history and that Ukrainians should be allowed to choose how to present their own experiences. He praises local researchers’ efforts to study the Holocaust and open their archives and notes that Ukraine’s current president, [Mr.] Zelenskyy, is Jewish. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7280451" data-originallang="en"> “Ukraine has begun the process of confronting the darkest pages of its past,” he says. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7280452" data-originallang="en"> In today’s charged atmosphere, saying anything critical about Ukrainian nationalism or calling attention to Ukrainian nationalists’ involvement with the Nazis can be seen as supporting Russia’s depiction of Ukraine as a Nazi nation, Belsky notes. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7280453" data-originallang="en"> This Russian narrative is nothing new.... [I]t’s part of a long-term Russian information war— </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7280454" data-originallang="en">I would call it a misinformation war.</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7280455" data-originallang="en"> —on Ukraine. Putin’s ahistorical justification of the invasion doesn’t surprise [scholars]. What does surprise [scholars] is the outpouring of support [they've] seen for Ukraine, with even [the very popular American skit comedy] “Saturday Night Live” paying tribute to the beleaguered nation. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7280456" data-originallang="en"> [Scholars theorize] that the outraged response to the invasion is tied to society’s relatively recent reexamination of colonialism. Because Ukraine was successfully integrated into the Soviet Union after World War II, Dobczansky doesn’t see the period leading up to Ukrainian independence in 1991 as an occupation so much as a relationship between a colony and a colonizer. By waging war on Ukraine, Putin is, in essence, trying to hold on to a colony. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7280457" data-originallang="en"> “[Russian leaders] basically don’t recognize any Ukrainian historical agency except the agency that they imagined for them,” says Dobczansky. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7280458" data-originallang="en"> Ukraine—and the world—seem to be imagining something different. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7280459" data-originallang="en">I think the takeaway there is the false narrative that Putin is sharing with the world as his illegal justification for invading this country. It may appease and it may pacify his nationalists in Russia because of its state-controlled media, but the rest of the world does not buy into this misinformation rhetoric.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7280460" data-originallang="en"> The issue regarding colonization is troubling, because we all know that Putin is a relic of the U.S.S.R. We all know about his pursuit of power at all costs. His international war crime legacy and history are not lost on me. This begs the question: What country is next? Is he going to be satisfied with just Ukraine? Is he looking at some of the other Baltic nations?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7280461" data-originallang="en">Right now, we have what could be described as a ground operation in Ukraine. We have ground and air strikes. We have missile strikes. However, what about the cyberwar? There is a cyberwar currently happening with respect to this conflict, and I want to share my thoughts and concerns on that issue at this time, with this quote:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7280462" data-originallang="en"> It has widely been assumed that the Western world saw the last of its hot conventional wars with the end of the Second World War, as the world grew increasingly integrated economically, making this type of conflict inefficient. The liberal international order assumed rationality would prevail and countries would choose the economic benefits of these relationships over conflict. Economics became a new tool to replace traditional military means of force if peaceful relations deteriorated; sanctions, preferential trade and exclusion from financial institutions all became methods of punishment and retaliation. With the rise of the internet, the world became further interconnected, but also more vulnerable to attack through cyber-space, as critical infrastructure, finance and access to information all have come to depend on online systems. Warfare came to be regarded differently, with cyber-warfare expected to be the future of conflict. Yet, Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, launching a full-on conventional war. Western countries rushed to apply economic pressure, applying sanctions— </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7280463" data-originallang="en">I will, after this article, start talking about the history of the Magnitsky sanctions, the origin of those sanctions and the man himself, because it's important to put everything in context.</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7280464" data-originallang="en"> —excluding Russia from the SWIFT system, payment systems and banks, cutting access to the country, banning travel and a host of other harsh conditions. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7280465" data-originallang="en"> Meanwhile, the internet has been flooded with real-time information on the invasion. However, disinformation and censoring are rampant, with civilians, combatants, world leaders, governments and journalists competing to post the latest updates. Cyber-attacks are playing a role in the conflict, though have not been the sole or even most important aspect of the hostilities; furthermore, they are coming not just from state-sponsored organizations, but non-state hacker groups and even volunteer hackers on both sides. Private sector organizations were drawn into the conflict as some chose to suspend services to Russia or support cyber-resiliency in Ukraine. In recent years, Russia has employed many devastating cyber-attacks against Ukraine, including on the country’s electricity grid in 2015, with the virus NotPetya on the Ukrainian financial system which spread globally, and other Eastern European countries. Considering Russia’s extensive history of hacking and policy of information warfare, this raises the question: Why are we not seeing a cyber-war, and will we? </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7280466" data-originallang="en"> To fully answer that question, it's important to get context on the record as to what really is a cyberwar:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7280467" data-originallang="en"> Cyber-war is a fairly contested term, and not all believe that cyber-war actually exists. For the most part, nation states look to international law and the rules on use of force and self-defence regarding the legality of cyber-operations. The Tallinn Manual and Tallinn Manual 2.0 both analyze extensively— </p>
