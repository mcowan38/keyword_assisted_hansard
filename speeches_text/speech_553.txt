<p data-HoCid="6468094" data-originallang="en">Today is Holocaust Remembrance Day. It is a stark reminder of the atrocities that can occur when we do not speak up against hate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6468095" data-originallang="en"> On January 6, we watched as Capitol Hill in Washington was stormed by a mob of insurrectionists, white supremacists and hate groups, cheered on by leaders who spread misinformation and promoted vigilantism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6468096" data-originallang="en"> In Nanaimoâ€”Ladysmith, racism raised its ugly head on social media and in the community when there was a COVID outbreak in the Snuneymuxw First Nation. Ignorance about the effects of colonization on indigenous health outcomes was on full display. Chief Wyse rightly said that the burden of addressing racism needed to come off of the shoulders of indigenous people. Indeed, it needs to come off the shoulders of all who are affected by racism and bigotry.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6468097" data-originallang="en"> Together, we have a responsibility to combat hate in all its forms. </p>
