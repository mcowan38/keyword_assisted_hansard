<p data-HoCid="7651041" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I agree that dental care is very important for families, and I understand the costs and concerns around access to dental care. However, I am also concerned that the government's approach to just about everything it has done is to harm our ability to have a robust economy that can afford the sustainable programs Canadians rely on.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7651042" data-originallang="en">I have concerns about cost and about how any type of system would work, and I have no confidence in the government to deliver one. I encourage members of the NDP, including the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>, to demand a bit more accountability regarding the failures of the government on any of a host of issues, perhaps including dental care.</p>
