<p data-HoCid="8547170" data-originallang="en">As I was saying, what is the objective of this motion? Are we talking about vilifying the clean-tech industry specifically? I realize and understand and appreciate the three-word campaigns they love to go on. Are we vilifying the clean-tech industry here? Are we going down the rabbit hole of producing all these documents and all these contracts without setting any barriers or any boundaries? </p>

<p data-HoCid="8547172" data-originallang="en">As I indicated earlier, what are the dangers of vilifying an entire industry? I know and understand that the majority of the Conservative Party votes come from Alberta. They have a specific narrative that they want to go downâ€”</p>
