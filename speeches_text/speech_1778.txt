<p data-HoCid="7265120" data-originallang="en">Greetings to all the other committee members here today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7265121" data-originallang="en">It's a very important subject we're covering. A lot of Canadians have genuine and sincere concerns when they consider this. As our world continues to change at such a rapid pace and we're seeing concerns about privacy continue to rise—balanced with the need for security for populations—I think Canadians want to be assured that all the possible safeguards are put in to protect individual rights and the privacy rights of Canadians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7265122" data-originallang="en">Mr. Israel, I'll go to you first. Your report makes several interesting recommendations when it comes to what you would like to see in a legislative framework for facial recognition technology, which we do not currently have. In your report, you write that the need for legislative backing applies to border control implementations that rely on a form of consent, such as opt out or opt in.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7265123" data-originallang="en">Do you believe all use of facial recognition technology by border control should have an opt-in, opt-out component?</p>
