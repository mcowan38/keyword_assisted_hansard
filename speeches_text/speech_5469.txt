<p data-HoCid="8714882" data-originallang="en"> Any decision that would eventually be made.... I would remind this committee that the underlying goal of the Government of Canada is to promote all gestures, negotiations and posturing that will lead to a negotiated settlement between Israelis and Palestinians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714883" data-originallang="en">This is what the international community, writ large, aims to do, for the most part. If the government were to choose to trigger this element, which has always been part of the sandbox within which negotiations between parties were included, it would be as an incentive, as a boost to encourage dialogue and a return to a framework that has been in steady decline since the Oslo accords of 1993. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8714884" data-originallang="en">What we've seen instead is a cycle of violence, an expansion of settlements in the West Bank and a denial of one another's existence in a higher and higher proportion, both on the Israeli side and the Palestinian side.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714885" data-originallang="en">The consideration here is this: What do we need to do as an international community—and as a country—to trigger a reset, to create incentives for parties to come to the table and start negotiating in good faith and to return to a peaceful dialogue, rather than to the vortex of violence that we have been observing?</p>
