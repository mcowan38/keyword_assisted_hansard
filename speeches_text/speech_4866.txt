<p data-HoCid="8576379" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, through you, I want to assure the hon. member that I did not use talking points. What has been happening to Israel, which is something I mentioned in my speech, is unacceptable. Israel has been attacked by two terrorist organizations, as well as a state that sponsors terror.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576380" data-originallang="en">I am insulted that the member would not give credit to me and our government for actually caring about the people of Israel and that she would call my speech “talking points”.</p>
