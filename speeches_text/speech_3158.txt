Canada could not set up this kind of tribunal alone, and it would be most legitimate if it had the buy-in of both Israel and the Palestinian Authority in order to create this.

Whether it's a hybrid court, the ICC, universal jurisdiction prosecutions or the International Court of Justice, whatever it may be, this is the kind of conflict where justice deserves a chance.</p>
