<p data-HoCid="7265211" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7265212" data-originallang="en">Through you, I'd like to really thank these two witnesses. They've been outstanding and I really do appreciate their insights.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7265213" data-originallang="en">For the two witnesses, if you don't know how committees work here in the House of Commons, we actually have to receive written or verbal testimony for us to make recommendations. We have to hear something on the issue before we can go forward on it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7265214" data-originallang="en">I would like to take this on a different tack. I'll ask both witnesses this today. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7265215" data-originallang="en">Mr. Israel, in response to Mr. Kurek, you were talking about transparency—or the other side, the opacity—of these FRT systems and how they surreptitiously take pictures and identify people. I guess my question would be this: Are either of you aware of a registry of companies that engage in facial recognition technology? Is there a list somewhere of companies, governments or agencies of governments that engage in capturing images for the purposes of FRT?</p>
