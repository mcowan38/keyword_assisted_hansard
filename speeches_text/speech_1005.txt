<p data-HoCid="6705877" data-originallang="en"> He said: Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to speak today and introduce Bill <a data-HoCid="11102177" href="/bills/43-2/S-223/" title="An Act respecting Kindness Week">S-223</a>, an act respecting kindness week. The pandemic has reminded us of the need for kindness in our society, and when passed, this bill would designate that throughout Canada, each and every year the third week of February is to be known as kindness week.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6705878" data-originallang="en">I want to thank my friends Senator Munson, who ushered the bill through the other place; the member for <a data-HoCid="252671" href="/politicians/emmanuella-lambropoulos/" title="Emmanuella Lambropoulos">Saint-Laurent</a>, who is helping to usher the bill through this place; and Rabbi Reuven Bulka, the inspiration for this bill, having set out on this journey of kindness week 17 years ago here in Ottawa.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6705879" data-originallang="en">On the need for kindness, I think all members in this place can agree. I respectfully ask that members pass this bill expeditiously.</p>
