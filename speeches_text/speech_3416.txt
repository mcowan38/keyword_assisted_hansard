<p data-HoCid="8174264" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, Gaza is the most dangerous place to be a journalist. There have been 122 journalists killed in Netanyahu's onslaught. Mansour Shouman, a brave reporter in Gaza, a Canadian and a fellow Albertan, has been missing for over a week. Eyewitnesses say that he was taken into custody by the Israeli army. His mother is worried sick and said that the government has not done enough to keep her informed about his whereabouts. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8174265" data-originallang="en">Can the government commit to Mansour Shouman's mother and all his loved ones that it will do everything in its power to bring him home?</p>
