<p data-HoCid="7797401" data-originallang="en">This relates to the second-last part of this motion. Where it says “and that the committee invite witnesses from Canadian civil society, international humanitarian organizations,” we would replace the “and” that follows with “as well as Israeli and Palestinian human rights organizations and peacebuilding organizations”. One is sort of grammatical—“as well as Israeli and Palestinian human rights organizations”, and then we would add “and peacebuilding organizations”.</p>
