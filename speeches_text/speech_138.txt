<p data-HoCid="6180605" data-originallang="en">Thanks. I'm sorry to interrupt. We're right at the end time for the entire meeting. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6180606" data-originallang="en">I would like to thank our witnesses. It's been a bit of a struggle today with technology. Lightning blew things out for one of our clerks for a while, and I believe Ms. Gazan had some connection problems as well. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6180607" data-originallang="en">It's been a bit of a struggle, but we did get some remarkable evidence and testimony from our witnesses. One of the things we all take from this, I think, is that the discussion on COVID is far from over. We'll take that as direction and thank Amanda Meawasige, director of intergovernmental relations; Chief Mike Mckenzie; Jean-Claude Therrien; and Dr. Stanley Vollant. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6180608" data-originallang="en">Thank you, all. I declare this meeting adjourned.</p>
