<p data-HoCid="8576885" data-originallang="en">The member asked earlier in the evening about the arms embargo that New Democrats have been calling on the government to undertake. There is arms trade treaty legislation in this country because we are signatories to the genocide convention, which says that we are in fact not able to send weapons to any country that may be engaged in a genocide. The international justice system has said there is a plausible case for genocide. The genocide convention does not require proof of genocide; it requires a plausibility or a likelihood of genocide, so it is against the law for Canada to send weapons to Israel at this time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576886" data-originallang="en">I wonder whether the member has any comments on that or whether he needs some help from the backbench to help him interpret international law.</p>
