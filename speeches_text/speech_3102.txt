<p data-HoCid="8063334" data-originallang="en">I am now ready to rule on the point of order raised on November 23, 2023, by the member for <a data-HoCid="278368" href="/politicians/heather-mcpherson/" title="Heather McPherson">Edmonton Strathcona</a> concerning language used by the member for <a data-HoCid="278498" href="/politicians/jake-stewart/" title="Jake Stewart">Miramichi—Grand Lake</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8063335" data-originallang="en">In her intervention, the member for <a data-HoCid="278368" href="/politicians/heather-mcpherson/" title="Heather McPherson">Edmonton Strathcona</a> alleged that the member for <a data-HoCid="278498" href="/politicians/jake-stewart/" title="Jake Stewart">Miramichi—Grand Lake</a> had repeatedly used unparliamentary language in characterizing her and her party's position on the situation in Gaza.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8063336" data-originallang="en">In response, the member for <a data-HoCid="278498" href="/politicians/jake-stewart/" title="Jake Stewart">Miramichi—Grand Lake</a> acknowledged having called members of the New Democratic Party “Hamas supporters”, repeating the statement into the record. I should point out there was an extended and, I might add, disorderly back-and-forth when the point of order was raised.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8063337" data-originallang="fr"> In House of Commons Procedure and Practice, third edition, at page 623, it is stated: </p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8063338" data-originallang="fr"> The proceedings of the House are based on a long-standing tradition of respect for the integrity of all Members. Thus, the use of offensive, provocative, or threatening language in the House is strictly forbidden. Personal attacks, insults and obscenities are not in order. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8063339" data-originallang="en">Further down, at page 624, it says:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8063340" data-originallang="en"> In dealing with unparliamentary language, the Speaker takes into account the tone, manner and intention of the Member speaking, the person to whom the words at issue were directed, the degree of provocation, and most important, whether or not the remarks created disorder in the Chamber. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8063341" data-originallang="fr">In a ruling on March 29, 2022, found at page 3739 of the Debates, the Deputy Speaker stated: </p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8063342" data-originallang="fr"> The use of inflammatory and provocative statements is contrary to the respect owed to all members. Accordingly, the Chair reminds members to be mindful of the language they use in debate, with respect to their colleagues, in order to maintain proper civility and respect in our proceedings. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8063343" data-originallang="en">To quote the Chair’s statement of October 18, 2023, found at pages 17591 to 17593 of the Debates: </p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8063344" data-originallang="en"> We have, in the past, had members likening their colleagues to Mussolini or calling each other racists or shouting obscenities. Latitude in expressing one's point of view will be given, but questionable language and unnecessarily provocative statements will no longer be tolerated. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8063345" data-originallang="en">Clearly, it is disruptive and disrespectful to associate other members with a terrorist organization. As a result, I have concluded that the words used by the member for <a data-HoCid="278498" href="/politicians/jake-stewart/" title="Jake Stewart">Miramichi—Grand Lake</a> were unparliamentary. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8063346" data-originallang="fr">In a ruling on a similar matter, my predecessor set forth the Chair's expectation of what must follow to bring resolution to the matter. He stated on May 8, 2023, at page 14090 of Debates:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8063347" data-originallang="fr"> To be quite clear, any remarks the Chair deems unparliamentary will be required to be withdrawn immediately and accompanied by a full and proper apology. If a member refuses to comply, the Chair will cease to recognize them until further notice. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8063348" data-originallang="en">In consequence, in accordance with my statement from October 18, 2023, the member will not be recognized by the Chair until such time as he apologizes in writing to the Speaker.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8063349" data-originallang="en">In conclusion, while reviewing the proceedings of last Thursday, November 23, I noted that other words and phrases were used that, while perhaps not strictly unparliamentary, certainly do not contribute to the level of decorum that we all desire. I therefore strongly encourage members, from all sides, to choose their words judiciously and avoid provocative interventions. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8063350" data-originallang="en">I thank all members for their attention, and I would invite their co-operation in raising the level of decorum in this place by not engaging in the kinds of comparisons or associations we have heard. </p>
