<p data-HoCid="8714907" data-originallang="fr">The draft resolution at the United Nations in May was the fifth to deal with UN issues relating to the function of the Palestinian delegation at the UN since 1974. Each time, the draft resolutions were aimed at adding powers to the delegation. It wasn't necessarily a question of recognizing a state. This time, it was about adding additional powers.</p>
