<p data-HoCid="8602313" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, after nine years of the Liberal <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, Canada has experienced a shocking rise in anti-Semitism and an increase in hate crimes of 165%. His divisive politics, where he pits one group of Canadians against another, only makes matters worse. It also does not help that he takes years to list terrorist groups on the list of banned organizations, allowing them to fundraise and recruit here in Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8602314" data-originallang="en">This one should be easy, though. The Houthis are attacking civilian ships and innocent civilians, and our allies have already banned them, so will the government do the right thing and list this group as a terrorist organization today?</p>
