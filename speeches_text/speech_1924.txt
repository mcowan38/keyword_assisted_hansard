<p data-HoCid="7361736" data-originallang="en">Thank you for your question, Ms. Gazan.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7361737" data-originallang="en">Yes, we know that research demonstrates that the impact of the criminalization of substance use not only leads to deterring people—particularly marginalized, vulnerable people, including women, trans women and non-binary folks—from seeking care, but it also delays access to care and further pushes them underground, where they have fears of arrest, fears of criminalization and fears of child apprehension.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7361738" data-originallang="en"> The system that surrounds criminalization actually has a ripple effect that is worse. CMHA is advocating for a nationwide approach to decriminalization to respond to that.</p>
