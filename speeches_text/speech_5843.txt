These are not votes taken against any country and certainly not against Israel. The policies that Canada has adopted are based on reason, on international law and on the need for a two-state solution, for a political path away from where we are today and for an urgent response to the depth of the crisis in Gaza, which I think most people would recognize. Certainly, all the people working in the field, from UNICEF to the World Food Programme, and all the agencies working in the region are telling us this is one of the worst and most serious humanitarian situations that has been faced. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8813184" data-originallang="en">I appreciate your question. </p>
