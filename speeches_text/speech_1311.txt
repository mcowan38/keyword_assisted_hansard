<p data-HoCid="6844568" data-originallang="en">I was at my mom's house. Someone came and told me to pack my stuff in a garbage bag, and 45 minutes later I was in a house where I didn't know anyone. There was some guy who kept grabbing my ass, and when I told my social worker I didn't want him to do that, she laughed and said, “Boys will be boys; just stay out of his way.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="6844569" data-originallang="en">We need to be working on keeping families together. Yes, that can be hard, but it's still the best. My group home was so unsafe, and since no one listened to us about how unsafe it was, we decided we would rather take our chances out on the streets. I was 12. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6844570" data-originallang="en">You know, you're on the streets and you meet a guy named Telly, and Telly invites you back to his place. You have drugs and alcohol, and you think you're so cool because Telly wants to hang out with you, and suddenly you understand that everything comes for a price, right? That price is sex at 12, when he's probably in his thirties or forties. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6844571" data-originallang="en">I think we need to also expand what “family” means. I think colonialism has put a very narrow definition on what “family” means. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6844572" data-originallang="en">I'm sorry that I'm stuttering. I don't even know where to start. It's just so bad. We need to tear it down and start all over again. That's the only way I see it working. I've been a foster parent for my friends' kids and I've done emergency placements for whatever reason, and kids want their parents no matter what. Let's fix those parents so that we can fix those kids so that this ongoing cycle of in and out of care can stop.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6844573" data-originallang="en">That's all.</p>
