<p data-HoCid="7957467" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, I would like to ask my hon. colleague if he could comment on the following two questions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957468" data-originallang="en">First, what does he believe would happen should Hamas announce, at this moment, that they were releasing the hostages being held in Gaza?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957469" data-originallang="en">Second, what does he believe would happen in the region if Hamas were to change from its charter, its aim and its pursuit of the eradication of the Jewish people from the Earth?</p>
