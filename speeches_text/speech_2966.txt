<p data-HoCid="8027898" data-originallang="en">Thanks, Ms. Tait. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8027899" data-originallang="en">You mentioned in your opening comments that public trust was the most important, so I want to speak to this notion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8027900" data-originallang="en">On October 17, the CBC published a false headline based on dangerous disinformation that incorrectly stated that Israel was responsible for the explosion at the hospital in Gaza that resulted in the deaths of innocent civilians. If you don't have it, I have it right here. That is the headline. It says, “Hundreds killed in Israeli airstrike on Gaza City hospital, Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza says”. That was since changed—if you don't have this—to “Palestinians say hundreds killed in Israeli airstrike on hospital; Israel blames Islamic Jihad”. This still lives on the CBC website. This headline is still there. It remains on the website.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8027901" data-originallang="en">I would hope you would agree with me that in fact the Palestinian health authority is controlled by Hamas. I think that is a fact.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8027902" data-originallang="en">The <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, the <a data-HoCid="300003" href="/politicians/bill-blair/" title="Bill Blair">Minister of National Defence</a> and the governments of the United States, Britain and France all have definitively said that the attack did not come from Israel, so why won't the CBC?</p>
