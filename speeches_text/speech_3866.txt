<p data-HoCid="8301066" data-originallang="en"> I appreciate Mr. Garrison's amendment. Of course, Islamophobia is also a very important form of hate, but they are two very distinct and separate forms of hate, so I want to make sure that it is clear that the meetings that we're going to have on one versus the other and the report that we're going to do are going to be clear that we're doing something on anti-Semitism and something on Islamophobia and that they're not two tropes that are together. Too many times, people feel that one is equal to the other, and when an act of anti-Semitism occurs, they feel necessary to mention Islamophobia in the same breath and vice versa. In the same way, anti-Black racism is not the same as anti-gay racism. They are all different tropes, so my proposal would be to subamend Mr. Garrison's amendment to add the following words. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8301067" data-originallang="en">It would now read, in line two, “Undertake a study on the issue of anti-Semitism and”, and add the words, “a study on the issue of Islamophobia”. I'm adding the words “a study on the issue of” after the end of line two. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8301068" data-originallang="en">In line five at the beginning of the second paragraph, we would replace the word “study”, the third word, with “independent studies”. Then, on line seven at the beginning of the third paragraph, instead of saying “that the study”, it should say “that each study”. Then, instead of “that it should be at least six meetings”, it would be “that each study should be at least two meetings”. I've heard from colleagues that six meetings means that we're not studying anything else for a prolonged period of time, so instead of three meetings each, it would be two meetings each: two meetings on anti-Semitism and two meetings on Islamophobia. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8301069" data-originallang="en">Then, “that the committee report its findings on both studies”. So, after the word “findings”, it would be “on both studies to the House”. </p>
