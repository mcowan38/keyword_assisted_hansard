<p data-HoCid="7988237" data-originallang="en"> From the perspective of assisting Canadians—and I'll turn it to my colleague on the broader diplomat piece—we have a team in Ramallah, and they are working hard to assist the departure of Canadians, permanent residents and their family members. We have assisted with departures from across the West Bank. We are, I would say, one of the only countries to be doing this as effectively as we are right now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988238" data-originallang="en">From that perspective, we have a very good understanding of the context right now in the West Bank and how to help people cross that border into Jordan, with the assistance of our embassy there as well. Both of those teams—our team in Amman and our team in Ramallah—are completely mobilized to help Canadians and their families get across that border.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988239" data-originallang="en">The Rafah border is a much more complex situation. We are working very closely with all of the regional players—Egypt, the U.S., our Five Eyes partners and of course all who have a stake in that border—to ensure that when that border opens, Canadians, their families and permanent residents are able to have onward safe passage to Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988240" data-originallang="en">We are working all angles on that very issue, and we are deeply engaged with all who can help facilitate that movement. It will be a multinational movement in terms of the Gaza situation.</p>
