<p data-HoCid="8658719" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8658720" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair and members of the committee, for inviting us.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8658721" data-originallang="en">I'm here on behalf of the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, or the UN Refugee Agency. We work to protect people forced to flee their homes because of conflict and persecution in more than 130 countries.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8658722" data-originallang="en">Let me begin by setting the scene.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8658723" data-originallang="en">As of the end of June, protracted and emerging crises have driven global displacement to a staggering 122.6 million people worldwide. That's three times the population of Canada. The numbers have almost doubled since a decade ago, and show no signs of slowing down.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8658724" data-originallang="en">These figures do not capture the hundreds of thousands of people who have been recently displaced in Lebanon, nor the further 400,000 people who crossed into Syria from Lebanon or the thousands of displaced Israelis. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8658725" data-originallang="en">At the same time, away from the headlines, we are facing one of the worst humanitarian crises in recent history in Sudan. Conflict has displaced more than eight million people inside the country. We're also approaching three million refugees in neighbouring states.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8658726" data-originallang="en">The situations in Lebanon and Sudan are just two examples of the current challenges we're facing. Two-thirds of forcibly displaced people originate from just 10 countries, including Ukraine, Myanmar, Haiti, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Venezuela.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8658727" data-originallang="en">The statistics are staggering, but behind the numbers are people—moms, dads, students, toddlers and seniors—ordinary folks whose lives have been torn apart, yet the world's response remains deeply unequal.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8658728" data-originallang="en">Most refugees remain in neighbouring countries, many of which are low- or middle-income nations already facing their own challenges.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8658729" data-originallang="en">The effects of climate change have further compounded the crisis, with 70% of refugees in 2022 coming from climate-vulnerable countries, an increase from 56% 10 years earlier.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8658730" data-originallang="en">As displacement rises, the resources available to respond have not kept up. This year, our operations are only 45% funded, creating a critical shortfall that severally impacts our ability to respond to an increasing number of emergencies. Cutting essential services has been inevitable. Those who depend on us for life-saving support are suffering the most.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8658731" data-originallang="en">Despite this sombre picture, the right policies, attitudes and supports can bring positive change. This is where we turn to you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8658732" data-originallang="en">For decades, the UN Refugee Agency has relied on Canada for leadership and support in meeting these global challenges. Canada continues to be a top donor to the UN Refugee Agency. It's a partnership we value and that we hope to grow to keep up with needs.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8658733" data-originallang="en">Canada has also been a leading resettlement country and a model in pioneering new legal pathways for refugees. Both globally and in Canada, we're witnessing a rise in the number of people seeking asylum. Canada has established itself as a global leader in asylum by maintaining a fair, efficient and robust system for many years.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8658734" data-originallang="en">At the same time, we'd like to thank Canada for its support to countries in the Americas to strengthen their asylum systems. Canada regularly shares best practices and provides financial support to strengthen asylum systems in countries such as Mexico and Costa Rica.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8658735" data-originallang="en">In closing, we would like to thank the committee for your interest in how Canada can best respond to the rise of forced displacement. It is a shared global responsibility, and addressing it is only possible through a global solidarity translated into action. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8658736" data-originallang="en">This requires determined political will and financial support. It includes addressing the root causes of conflict, creating conditions for refugees to return home in safety and dignity, helping them integrate into their countries of refuge and expanding access to third country solutions. This will not be easy, but Canada has proven that it has the fortitude and commitment to make a real difference for people forced to flee worldwide.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8658737" data-originallang="en">We look forward to your questions and your continued support. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8658738" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
