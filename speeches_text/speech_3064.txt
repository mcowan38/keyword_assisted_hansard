<p data-HoCid="8020800" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, since the current conflict in Gaza began, more than 10,000 innocent civilians have lost their lives. Over 4,000 of them are children. More children were killed in Gaza in one month than in any conflict annually since 2019. Eighty-nine UNRWA employees have been killed. This is the highest number of UN aid workers killed in a conflict ever. Nearly 40 journalists have died. They were not terrorists. They were mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, daughters and sons. How many more innocent people's lives will be lost?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8020801" data-originallang="en">When our grandchildren ask us what we did during this crisis, what do we want to tell them? The <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> said that the price of justice cannot be the continued suffering of Palestinian citizens. I agree.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8020802" data-originallang="en"> At every opportunity, I have called for a return of all hostages and a ceasefire to save innocent civilian lives. It is the only answer, and I will continue to make this plea: ceasefire now.</p>
