<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, that was a master class in disinformation, but it was a dismal example of what we have seen from that member in misrepresentations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">I was fascinated that the last time she did one of her spiels, she claimed that Bill <a data-HoCid="12525473" href="/bills/44-1/C-50/" title="An Act respecting accountability, transparency and engagement to support the creation of sustainable jobs for workers and economic growth in a net-zero economy">C-50</a>, which came to us from working with labour unions and energy workers, was a “woke globalist agenda.” Now, “globalist” has become very much identified as one of the key hate terms of conspiracy theories, and one of the people promoting hate conspiracy is Alex Jones, who of course is supporting the present <a data-HoCid="278241" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">leader</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">I would like to give her the opportunity to explain why her party is so tied into using the hate language of Alex Jones, Tucker Carlson and the extreme right on language like “globalist.”</p>
