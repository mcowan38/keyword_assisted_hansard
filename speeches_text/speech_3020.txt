<p data-HoCid="8002783" data-originallang="en">We unequivocally condemn the Hamas terrorist attack. The price of justice cannot be the continued suffering of all Palestinian civilians. What is unfolding in Gaza is a human tragedy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8002784" data-originallang="en">The <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="MÃ©lanie Joly">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> has been to the region twice to oversee our efforts to help Canadians and also work to de-escalate. We continue to call for humanitarian law to be upheld and for humanitarian pauses. Canadians must be allowed to leave. More humanitarian aid needs to be delivered and all hostages must be released.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8002785" data-originallang="en">Canada is committed to a goal of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.</p>
