<p data-HoCid="6528865" data-originallang="en">There's some very interesting news coming out of Israel from the Israeli health ministry and Pfizer, which seems to have very thorough reporting of data. They're saying the Pfizer vaccine reduces asymptomatic cases by 90%. If I got that right, that's really significant, and they seem to have the same interpretation. This means a lot, because previously we thought you could get the vaccine but maybe you still could get an asymptomatic infection and could transmit it on. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6528866" data-originallang="en">If true, and I don't know whether you think the data is adequate enough, it would seem to have immense implications for a lot of different policy areas, from whether people who worked in chronic care homes could continue to do so without being vaccinated to opening our borders to people who have been vaccinated. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6528867" data-originallang="en">How good do you think that data is, and should we make policy decisions based on it?</p>
