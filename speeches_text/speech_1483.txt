<p data-HoCid="6975543" data-originallang="en">In response, through the chair, let me just make a couple of observations. I think communities like ours, and there are many in Canada, feel an imperative to make a contribution to the country, to encourage and foster a sense of not just belonging but of meaningful contribution to the upbuilding of Canada through public service. It is not the most obvious path that people from marginalized or ethnic communities might choose. They don't necessarily have easy or equal access to some of the programs that would encourage that kind of engagement.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6975544" data-originallang="en">We feel that it reflects a core Jewish value to give back to community, not in a parochial sense but in a much broader, general sense. For us, the value of the program is not what we accrue directly by way of benefit to us. Rather, it's fostering a certain sense of commitment to Canada and to contributing to the public process.</p>
