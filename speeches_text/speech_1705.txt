This year's audit revealed the number of violent incidents against Jews in Canada went up from nine in 2020 to 75 in 2021â€”a 733% increase. While at McGill, the board of trustees annulled the student society motion, clearly, there's been a movement at certain campuses to make anti-Zionism the new form of anti-Semitism, denying the rights of Jews to self-determination in their historic homeland, and basically attacking Jews everywhere for decisions made by Israel.</p>

In Germany, Austria and certain countries, advocating BDS is actually illegal. In Canada, the motion adopted by Parliament had no legal force.</p>
