<p data-HoCid="7988370" data-originallang="en">I think Canada has been very clear and continues to be very clear that there needs to be a political horizon. The political horizon that has been laid out by the international community in UN Security Council resolutions and other frameworks is the two-state solution. This is a solution, though, that would need to be negotiated between the parties. We think it's tremendously important at this moment in time that the political horizon be there. We look for ways to encourage that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988371" data-originallang="en">You'll see that the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="MÃ©lanie Joly">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> and the <a data-HoCid="300012" href="/politicians/ahmed-hussen/" title="Ahmed Hussen">Minister for International Development</a> participated in a conference held in Egypt this weekend that was dedicated on the one hand to humanitarian assistance and on the other hand to trying to make sure that there is discussion of this political horizon, that we keep this out there and keep it as the horizon of hope. Without that horizon of hope, we're not going to be able to engage the players in what we need to do to move this situation forward in a healthy way.</p>
