<p data-HoCid="8093375" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much for the question. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8093376" data-originallang="en">To add to what others have said, it's important to get the message out there about what the overall effects of this are doing to children in Gaza, and the ongoing effects for children with previous disabilities, but also now for children with new injuries and disabilities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8093377" data-originallang="en">Canada can play a role by highlighting and being able to spread messages. Many organizations are there doing lots of important work, but finding out the testimonies, finding out what's actually happening on the ground, and being able to help, promote and explain what's happening so that people are aware are all really important.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8093378" data-originallang="en">We have a report coming out before, during and after a crisis, for example. There is also weekly advocacy on things that are happening week by week, just to update the situation, to share what's actually happening on the ground and how we're supporting children, for example, with psychosocial activities, well-being activities, and just the sheer basic needs that are required. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8093379" data-originallang="en">I think it's about being able to raise that to the fore, because as you said, this hasn't had that much of a mention. It's much more, at the moment, about the numbers of dead, rather than the additional issues that are happening. There are people who had disabilities previously. For example, they can't move from the north to the south, because there are no physical means. Everybody else is walking to the south, but they can't get there. What happens to them? They weren't able to move.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8093380" data-originallang="en"> These kinds of testimonies aren't really out there in the media. I think it would be really helpful for Canada to be a part of helping to promote that. </p>
