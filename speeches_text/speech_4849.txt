<p data-HoCid="8568990" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, the member's question gives us an opportunity to recognize two Canadians who were innocent, who were killed trying to flee from violence in Lebanon. I particularly name Hussein Tabaja and Daad Tabaja.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8568991" data-originallang="en"> It is a tragedy that is ongoing in the whole Middle East. Canada has continually called for a ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel and between Israel and Hamas. We will continue to do everything diplomatically possible to work with allies and like-minded countries, and to express Canadians' concern about this tragedy, which is ongoing.</p>
