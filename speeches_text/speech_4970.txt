<p data-HoCid="8594781" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I was away last week in Dublin at the European security council meetings. Then I came back to find that we are again playing the games of the Conservatives.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8594782" data-originallang="en">There was so much to be discussed in Dublin. I believe my hon. colleague was there. I think of this song:</p>
<p data-HoCid="8594783" data-originallang="en"> <span class="verse"> Raised on songs and stories, heroes of renown<br> The passing tales and glories, that once was Dublin town<br> </span> </p>
<p data-HoCid="8594784" data-originallang="en">Then I came back here to see this sort of gamesmanship.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8594785" data-originallang="en">I would like to say to my hon. colleague this: While the Europeans are talking about Ukraine, the climate crisis and Gaza, here we are in Canada with a dysfunctional, abusive party that is interfering with democracy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8594786" data-originallang="en">I would like to get my hon. colleague's thoughts on that, and if she would like to share a song from Dublin, I would be more than happy to hear it.</p>
