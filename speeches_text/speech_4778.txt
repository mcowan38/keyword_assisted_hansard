<p data-HoCid="8585752" data-originallang="en">In the decision and announcement by <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="MÃ©lanie Joly">Minister Joly</a> that Canada was going to no longer export any materiel that's used in defence weapons that might end up in Israel's hands, does that again undermine the relationship between us and the United States?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8585753" data-originallang="en">Can you tell us how your contacts in the U.S. are viewing that decision? They might be exporting to some of our other allies that they can't get.... They might have a client in Israel, in the IDF, and they might not be able to get into the supply chain parts from Canada.</p>
