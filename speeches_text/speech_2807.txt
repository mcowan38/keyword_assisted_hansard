<p data-HoCid="7988445" data-originallang="en">I feel a little naive, but a month ago, I was at the UN speaking about “the day after” and looking at incentivizing a two-state solution of peace with justice so that Palestinians and Israelis can live side by side. It was drawn together by the EU, the Gulf States, Saudi Arabia and a number of countries. I feel naive now, because none of us predicted this mess. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7988446" data-originallang="en">Obviously, Canadians want peace with justice for both Palestinians and Israelis. Do you have any thoughts about the day after? How can we move Canada into a position...? </p>
<p data-HoCid="7988447" data-originallang="en">We have solved crises before. I'm not saying we can do that with this one. Is there a role for Canada in this next phase?</p>
