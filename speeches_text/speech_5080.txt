<p data-HoCid="8663468" data-originallang="fr">A large portion of the Lebanese people do not want any forces other than Lebanese forces in southern Lebanon. However, if Canada could play a role and if UN peacekeeping forces were present on both sides of the border, it would help calm the situation and promote sustainable peace on a global scale. We don't want this war to recur every five, 10 or 15 years.</p>
