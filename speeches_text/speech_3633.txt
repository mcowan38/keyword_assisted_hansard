<p data-HoCid="8277034" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the words of the member for <a data-HoCid="278412" href="/politicians/brian-masse/" title="Brian Masse">Windsor West</a> moved and touched me. I would really love if it were absolutely true that, regardless of party, we were taking steps to see that this country does more, whatever we are capable of doing, in the heavy lifting to bring about peace. We know that peaceful solutions do not come without much diplomacy and much moral suasion to say we have to protect the lives of children and we defend the lives of Israeli and Palestinian children. I think this motion helps us to get there.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8277035" data-originallang="en">Can my hon. colleague from <a data-HoCid="278412" href="/politicians/brian-masse/" title="Brian Masse">Windsor West</a> think of any other way that we can get partisanship out of our way, because it stands in the way of peace?</p>
