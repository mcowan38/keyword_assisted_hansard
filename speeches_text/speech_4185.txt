<p data-HoCid="8412162" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412163" data-originallang="en">I am disappointed. It was really only through the courtesy of my colleague Mr. Champoux that the Liberals even had the ability, because otherwise they would have blown through the time. It's unfortunate that courtesy was taken advantage of.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412164" data-originallang="en">To move a motion that is clearly partisan in nature when it's meant to obstruct our study is strange, because it's led by a Liberal member.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412165" data-originallang="en">I thought we were having a constructive conversation. I thought there was some excellent witness testimony from all witnesses—from Liberal, NDP and Conservative witnesses. I would very much have liked to go forward.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412166" data-originallang="en">I know Mr. Serré has been waiting patiently to get his legislation through. I have a lot of respect for the member. It's disappointing that they've decided to obstruct their own legislation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412167" data-originallang="en"> We will be reviewing and providing more in-depth feedback with respect to this motion. I think it's fair to say that it requires some changes to take some of the partisan bite out of it and to move it to an area that is important.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412168" data-originallang="en">Of course, all parliamentarians want to make sure that we protect all people and that everyone feels safe, regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, race, culture or ethnicity. I believe that all 338 parliamentarians have it in their hearts to make sure that everyone gets an opportunity— whether they're born in Alderville First Nation, downtown Toronto or downtown Vancouver, and regardless of who they love—to be treated with the respect and dignity that all people deserve.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412169" data-originallang="en">I know from earlier that Mr. Coteau has spent some of his life fighting racism, which I think is brilliant. I appreciate his service.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412170" data-originallang="en">I think this is a very serious issue. I'm disappointed by the partisan tone of the motion. I think we could all work together to fight racism and to fight discrimination in all forms.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412171" data-originallang="en">There is just one area that is missing. You could perhaps put it under religious minorities. I would specifically like to see anti-Semitism called out, which we don't have in this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412172" data-originallang="en">I'll actually bring back and just discuss a motion that the Conservatives brought forward, which unfortunately was stonewalled by the Liberals. I would just like to read into the record—</p>
