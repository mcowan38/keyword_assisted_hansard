However, for CFIAT—and congratulations to Ms. Gazan for saying the full name correctly—it is clear that very affordable daycare places are needed in order to allow women to enter the workforce.

That is why it's urgent to review it, because more women will be coming into the workforce as a result of the future national program. The criteria for eligibility to the employment insurance program will have to be reviewed because, as you so rightly said, the reform in the 1990s was really done so that the program would benefit a certain category of workers, largely made up of men. We now recognize that, not only was the program not designed for women, but also that it discriminates against them.</p>
