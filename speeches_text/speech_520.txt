<p data-HoCid="6434382" data-originallang="en">Okay.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6434383" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Minister.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6434384" data-originallang="en"> I'd just like to point out that this bill already contains two “greater certainty” measures. I think the message that we got from the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs we're going to hear probably more than once from good-faith witnesses who want to get at the root of this issue but also want to ensure that the things that you said this bill does not do it, in fact, does not do. I would encourage you to continue to be open to the idea of that type of amendment.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6434385" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
