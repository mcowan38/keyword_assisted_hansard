<p data-HoCid="8293604" data-originallang="en">Mr. Lepofsky, I found your comments about being handed off three or four times in an airport—like “a baton”, I think you said—to be interesting. We've been talking about making sure that people are treated with respect and dignity and are provided a good service from the time they get out of their vehicle, or whatever transport they've used to get to the airport, until they're seated in the aircraft.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8293605" data-originallang="en">Your comments were focused largely on Air Canada. I assume that's the one you've had the most experience with. Has it been any different when you've travelled with any other domestic Canadian airlines? You referenced the United States. I see in some prepared remarks here that you also travel to Israel, etc. Where have you had the best experience, and with which airline, in terms of not being passed from person to person through the airport?</p>
