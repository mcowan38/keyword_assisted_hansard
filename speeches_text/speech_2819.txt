<p data-HoCid="7988497" data-originallang="en">Thank you. I'll take that question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988498" data-originallang="en">We're very concerned about the security situation in the West Bank. We are watching it very carefully. This is partially why we are so closely networked with our Five Eyes partners there, and with the UN and with others to understand what's going on and where there are risks. This is also why we are facilitating movements of Canadians to be able to exit, because we are concerned about an increase in checkpoints and about increased scrutiny at those checkpoints. We have heard from Canadians that they themselves are concerned about going through those checkpoints and that they feel more secure with our assistance and with our being there with them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988499" data-originallang="en">Tensions are very high. We will continue to monitor the situation. Some days are more straightforward than others. We're learning. Every time we are out, we are adding to how we mitigate our own risks there.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988500" data-originallang="en">Again, we've surged a number of our standing rapid deployment team officials into Ramallah, specifically to assess the security situation and ensure that we are enabling duty of care to our staff and that we are able to continue to support Canadians, their family members and permanent residents to exit, should they require our assistance.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988501" data-originallang="en">It's moving all the time. Are we concerned that it could deteriorate? Absolutely. This is why we are taking every opportunity right now to be agile and to assist. We've been very clear in our messaging that if Canadians require our assistance, we want them to contact us now.</p>
