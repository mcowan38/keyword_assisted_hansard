<p data-HoCid="8122443" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8122444" data-originallang="en">Thank you to the minister and his officials for being here today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8122445" data-originallang="en">I would like to begin my questions on the issue with the people in Gaza, more particularly the Canadians and people in Canada who are desperate to bring their loved ones to safety. It was brought up on the issue around extended family members and the definition of family.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8122446" data-originallang="en">Can the minister advise whether he will be making any changes to the definition of “immediate family” to include extended family members, such as siblings, parents, grandparents, nieces, and nephews, many of whom, by the way, are now orphaned?</p>
