<p data-HoCid="6243868" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6243869" data-originallang="fr">My question is for Ms. Alexeeva.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6243870" data-originallang="fr">As we know, during the Holocaust, the Nazis wanted to exterminate the Jews. However, many other minorities ended up in concentration camps.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6243871" data-originallang="fr">Iâ€™d like to draw some kind of parallel here. Do we know whether, in the current situation in Xinjiang, minorities other than Uighurs are in the camps of the Chinese authorities?</p>
