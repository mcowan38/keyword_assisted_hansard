<p data-HoCid="8733780" data-originallang="en">I think we've witnessed very concerning state suppression of particular groups, which is the subject of my statement today. Canada disproportionately surveils and targets certain communities, suppressing their freedom of expression and charter rights. The two examples I gave is of people exercising indigenous rights—indigenous land and water protectors—and Palestine solidarity. We saw these being quite targeted in the past year. There are numerous examples of people being charged for expression that is not hateful—that does not meet the stringent standard we have in the case law.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733781" data-originallang="en"> We are seeing a chilling effect on speech. Chilling one group's rights has impacts more broadly on people's confidence to exercise their own rights, no matter what the speech is. When they see people being criminalized and they see what happens to other people exercising their rights, it impacts more broadly.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733782" data-originallang="en"> I apologize if I didn't quite understand the question.</p>
