<p data-HoCid="8576351" data-originallang="en">As I communicated in my speech, that is a failure of the government. I hope that the hon. member will ask those questions of government members when it comes to their time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576352" data-originallang="en">New Democrats, in response to the conflict in Palestine and in Gaza, called upon this Parliament to put forward many ideas about how we could make change, including arms embargos and the recognition of the Palestinian state. We have not seen that occur. All of these things play a part in a larger push for peace that we could partake in.</p>
