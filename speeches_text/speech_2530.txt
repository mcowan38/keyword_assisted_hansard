<p data-HoCid="7931188" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, Canada's reputation is sullied. Our country is the topic of disparaging comments around the world. Worse, Putin's Russia is using our situation as an opportunity to spread disinformation. It is shameful for us. Far worse, it is revolting for millions of people, starting with Ukrainians themselves who are fighting the Russian monster, the Jewish community both here and around the world, and those who actually fought the Nazis.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7931189" data-originallang="fr">My late father fought the Waffen-SS in Italy, Provence and the Vosges. He was wounded twice, and had shrapnel from Nazi grenades buried near his skill his whole life. He was awarded a French mention in dispatches and given a medal. France awarded him the Legion of Honour. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7931190" data-originallang="fr">In these moments of great turmoil that we are experiencing, the head of government must fully assume the responsibilities of the state with great dignity and respect. At a time when our country is experiencing its worst diplomatic crisis, the silence of the past four days is intolerable. That is why, for the good of the country, we ask that the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> apologize.</p>
