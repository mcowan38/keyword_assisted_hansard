<p data-HoCid="8453826" data-originallang="en"> Yes. As you know, my team has been working intensely on this question since I last appeared in order to deal specifically with some challenges among those who took matters into their own hands to guarantee their own safety and exit through the Rafah crossing. In all cases, I believe, they had to pay exorbitant sums to leave, which I believe is unacceptable. It is obviously highly frustrating for people who are fleeing war and looking simply to stay alive. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8453827" data-originallang="en">We designed the public policy assuming there would be co-operation with COGAT—not presuming but assuming—to exit, in a structured way, through Rafah gates. Up until very recently, that was not possible. There were a number of questions as to whether this program was going to be recognized or not. I would say that, very recently—up to the closing of the Rafah crossing again on May 7—we had some positive signals from the Israeli government that this program would be recognized and that the processing through COGAT would be done in a timely fashion. Unfortunately, as you know, a number of events happened, including a more intense ground offensive in Rafah. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8453828" data-originallang="en">All that said, for those people who exited Gaza on their own terms, we have done one of two things. We included them under the current policy, or, for those who didn't have codes or applications submitted, taken another way through a temporary resident visa. We've issued all categories together. It's close to 500 in those particular categories. We had to make some adjustments. I believe that is something that had to be done. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8453829" data-originallang="en">Again, the public policy program.... Perhaps some of those who faced delays by taking matters into their own hands and leaving through the Rafah crossing on their own had to wait some time as we looked to carve them in and get them safely to Canada—again, after having gone through the biometrics and security processes. </p>
