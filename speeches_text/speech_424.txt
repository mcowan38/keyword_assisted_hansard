<p data-HoCid="6403544" data-originallang="en">Minister, Canada contributes $11.1 million to the International Criminal Court. In March, Amnesty International questioned a letter that Canada sent to the ICC on February 14, 2020, in which they reiterated Canada's position that the court doesn't have jurisdiction to investigate alleged war crimes in Palestine and also reminded the court of Canada's budgetary contributions. Amnesty interpreted that it appears to be a threat for Canada withdrawing financial support. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6403545" data-originallang="en">That is a serious accusation, which deserves a response by you and your government. Does such a letter exist? Will you release it to the committee? Does it, in fact, remind the court of Canada's contribution?</p>
