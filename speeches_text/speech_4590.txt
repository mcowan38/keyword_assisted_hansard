<p data-HoCid="8499200" data-originallang="en"> I think education and initiatives can be very helpful in this context. Again, the issue is in the how, and how it's centred. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8499201" data-originallang="en">We've chosen, in various ways, to centre the voices of those who have oftentimes been marginalized from our mainstream media. In the Muslims in Canada Archives, for example, we try to centre the voice of Muslims through their artifacts. We oversee a Hearing Palestine program; the idea there is to centre the voices of Palestinian Canadians and others to centre that narrative.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8499202" data-originallang="en">The challenge, of course, is creating the space for centring those voices, and I would hope that we could continue doing that.</p>
