<p data-HoCid="8200040" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8200041" data-originallang="en">I think a couple of things have overtaken this from when we had our schedule earlier, but you made a really good point. If we have witnesses lined up, that also involves travel for them and so forth, so I think we can find consensus here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8200042" data-originallang="en">If we get further resources for this committee, we can start the study earlier. That's what I would like to see. I think this is an issue that is significantly important. There are good interventions, but if we're going to then create a problem for other witnesses.... That was something we didn't have before this was even tabled. At one point, it didn't look like we had some of those witnesses coming forth, but we do now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8200043" data-originallang="en">I would offer that we leave this in your hands, Mr. Chair, to find out if we can actually get some additional resources to start this a bit more quickly, if possible. That's the way I would like to approach it, and I think it's a fair compromise for what we're trying to do here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8200044" data-originallang="en">I think it's a heightened environment with regard to what the cellphone companies have been doing. We all feel it. It's the number one correspondence that I get in my constituency on a regular basis, aside from Gaza and a few other situations that are taking place.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8200045" data-originallang="en">At any rate, my position would be to leave it in your hands to see if we can actually get additional resources in this committee to start this study a bit earlier and go from there so that we don't disrupt what our clerk has done and any other flow of the work that you have to do.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8200046" data-originallang="en"> If that's okay with the rest of the committee, I think that's a good way to go forward.</p>
