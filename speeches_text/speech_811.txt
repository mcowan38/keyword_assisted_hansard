<p data-HoCid="6586275" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, tomorrow evening marks the beginning of Passover. In my riding of York Centre, across Canada and around the world, millions of Jewish families will observe a millenia-old tradition, retelling the story of Exodus at the Seder table. Some of us this year may be celebrating alone, and others will be celebrating with family members on Zoom, together yet apart. Though we cannot gather this year, the story of Passover, of triumph over hardship and liberation from oppression is a timeless reminder of the lessons that guide us through our challenges today. The spirit of our communities in overcoming the pandemic and working together to protect our most vulnerable gives us reason to celebrate. It is a community that is strong, resilient and compassionate and truly an important part of the rich and diverse tapestry of Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6586276" data-originallang="en">As we see vaccinations increasing in anticipation of an end to the pandemic, the arrival of Passover, the holiday of spring, <em>Chag ha'Aviv</em> reassures us in the hope that perhaps a timely, modern, but temporary rewording of the <em>Chad Gadya</em> is appropriate this year. Next yearâ€”</p>
