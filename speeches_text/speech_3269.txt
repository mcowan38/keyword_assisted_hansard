<p data-HoCid="8128851" data-originallang="en">Thank you, sir.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8128852" data-originallang="fr">I have one last question, which has to do with contracts.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8128853" data-originallang="fr">When I was at the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates, we did all the checks on Pfizer and Moderna to get prices. The Minister of Health at the time, Ms. Anand, always said that it was secret. Meanwhile, the United States, Israel and the European Union were disclosing the price of their vaccines. We know that the Americans were paying $7 a dose. In Canada, we did some calculations, and we came up with about $25.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8128854" data-originallang="fr">Why, even today, are we unable to know how much the vaccines have cost?</p>
