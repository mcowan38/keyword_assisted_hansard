<p data-HoCid="8703047" data-originallang="en">Thank you for that question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703048" data-originallang="en">It's very important to recognize that there are so many organizations, like Standing Together and Peace Now, on the ground in Israel and Palestine doing this work.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703049" data-originallang="en">We work in close partnership with both Israelis and Palestinians because we believe that any solution that we want to bring forward has to come, first and foremost, from the ground. Their work to advance the issues of a two-state solution, Palestinian statehood and equality and equity in the land is really helping to advance how Israelis and Palestinians see their future.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703050" data-originallang="en"> I would like to speak a little bit to the question of support of the two-state solution, which can be attributed to a lot of these civil society organizations. We should recognize that both Israelis and Palestinians, when they are given a framework for what a two-state solution would look like.... I heard a lot of testimony that the numbers in support of a two-state solution in Israel and Palestine were quite low. That actually is not the case when a framework is given and it's explained what a two-state solution looks like. We actually see broad support—majority support—for that position. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8703051" data-originallang="en">It is so important that we continue to work with peace organizations like those that are doing the work on the ground because civil society.... Top-down and bottom-up approaches are both needed.</p>
