<p data-HoCid="8478171" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, we have been investing in more protection for mosques, synagogues, places of worship, and community centres for years. We are going to keep working with police forces across the country to protect people. At the same time, we are going to underscore how important it is that all Canadians remember our values of respect, openness, tolerance and acceptance.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8478172" data-originallang="fr">We will continue to be there to allow people to protest lawfully and peacefully, but also to counter hate speech and calls for violence.</p>
