<p data-HoCid="6027580">Mr. Speaker, the following reflects a consolidated response approved on behalf of Global Affairs Canada ministers.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6027581">In response to parts (a) to (c), Canada is strongly committed to the goal of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East, including the creation of a Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with Israel. Canadaâ€™s vote today is a reflection of this long-standing commitment.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6027582">Canada voted in support of this resolution as it addresses the core issue of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Canada strongly supports the international consensus on a two-state solution, so that both sides can have a secure and prosperous future.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6027583">Canada would also like to strongly reiterate our stated position and concern that there are too many resolutions related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a situation which unfairly singles out Israel for criticism. Canada would prefer to see the international community channel its efforts towards helping both sides to resume direct negotiations and work towards achieving a lasting peace for both peoples.</p>
