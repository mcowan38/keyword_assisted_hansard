<p data-HoCid="6169085" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, Israel has a new coalition government led by Benjamin Netanyahu, and it wants nothing less than to annex the Palestinian territories currently occupied by the military. This is a clear violation of international law.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6169086" data-originallang="fr">We have a responsibility to the Palestinian people under a military occupation that was condemned in UN Security Council resolution 2334. We are disappointed in the Liberal government's silence on this issue. It cannot simply say that Canada will not recognize the annexation of these territories and that such an action would be damaging to the peace process or security in the region. Canada has a responsibility to condemn this. A number of countries, including the United Kingdom, Ireland and Norway, have already done so. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6169087" data-originallang="fr">We cannot stand by while a country steals someone else's territory by force. We took action when Russia invaded Crimea. What is the government waiting for in this case? A violation of international law must have consequences, and Canada needs to set an example. Canada cannot remain silent on this violation of human rights.</p>
