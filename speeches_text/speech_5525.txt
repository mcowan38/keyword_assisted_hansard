<p data-HoCid="8731646" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8731647" data-originallang="en">Again, if I'm able to finish what I was saying, I'm talking about the 106(4) to make the point that we're not able to discuss any other issue at this committee if there's a filibuster going on and there are important issues. One of those is the news that there was a bombing plot on Parliament Hill. The <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">leader of the Conservative Party</a> was there. Our deputy leader was there. There were two Liberal members of Parliament. In fact, the former minister of public safety was at that gathering. A whole host of other innocent Canadians, particularly from the Jewish community, were there. It is shocking that it took parliamentarians 10 months to learn about what happened there. Why weren't we informed sooner?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8731648" data-originallang="en">With that, Mr. Chair, I would like to move a subamendment to the motion regarding this issue. If we look at the motion and the proposed amendment by the member from the NDP.... I'll read it out, and then I'll read out the subamendment, if that works. We'll ensure everybody has a copy of that, as well.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8731649" data-originallang="en"> If the amendment by Mr. MacGregor passes, the motion would read as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8731650" data-originallang="en"> That, once the committee has concluded both the study on Russian interference and disinformation campaigns in Canada and the study on electoral interference and criminal activities in Canada by agents of the Government of India, the committee proceed to the following matters in order: </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8731651" data-originallang="en"> This is where the subamendment would come in, Mr. Chair. A new number 1 would be added. It would read as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8731652" data-originallang="en"> 1) Given that recent court filings have revealed disturbing details about a thwarted ISIS linked bomb plot targeting Jewish Canadians on Parliament Hill, and given that hate crimes have increased 251% over the past nine years, </p>
<p data-HoCid="8731653" data-originallang="en"> The committee immediately prioritize a study to investigate the dramatic rise in terrorist plots and acts of violence targeting Canada's Jewish community, including the thwarted terror attack on Parliament Hill; that the study be comprised of no less than six meetings; that the Minister of Public Safety, the Special Advisor on Jewish Community Relations and Antisemitism to the Prime Minister, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner, the Director of the Parliamentary Protective Service, the Director of Canadian Security Intelligence Service and other law enforcement officials, and civil society and academic organizations, including the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs and B'nai B'rith, be invited to testify as part of this study; and that the committee report its findings and recommendations to the House. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8731654" data-originallang="en">The purpose of moving this subamendment, Mr. Chairâ€”</p>
