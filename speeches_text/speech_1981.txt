<p data-HoCid="7468293" data-originallang="en">I think it is something we've all talked about repeatedly over the last four or five months as we have looked at the messes at Pearson and Montréal-Trudeau to do with staffing levels, so it's nothing new. The question really is, what started this whole process and who is to be held accountable for all of these problems? The issue you talked about at Windsor is not within the airline's control. It's really up to the CBSA, with the border patrols, to basically look at staffing and to have the right equipment and the right processes in place.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7468294" data-originallang="en">While it's not as headline-grabbing as what happened at Pearson or Montréal-Trudeau, it was a problem, and there continues to be a problem with staffing levels at various airports across the country. We are still going through the process of trying to find people to staff those roles and to make sure they have the right equipment. It's not going to go away anytime soon, unfortunately. We're still going to be caught in a situation of being short of people. </p>
