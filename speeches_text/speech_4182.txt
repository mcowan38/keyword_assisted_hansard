<p data-HoCid="8378060" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, before I begin my remarks, I would like to state that I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278158" href="/politicians/james-bezan/" title="James Bezan">Selkirk—Interlake—Eastman</a>. I certainly look forward to his remarks as well.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8378061" data-originallang="en">Two weeks ago, I was sitting in my constituency office when I got a message from my colleague from <a data-HoCid="278442" href="/politicians/garnett-genuis/" title="Garnett Genuis">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</a>. He informed me that there was going to be a special meeting of a small group of us, where he would inform us of a very grave and serious situation. I do not know if one has ever received news where one was told they are the target of a cyber-attack, but I will say that it is terrifying. It is a moment in someone's life when the blood drains from one's face.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8378062" data-originallang="en">When someone is told the date of those attacks, January 2021, one wonders what they were doing that month. What was going on in their life that month? How serious is this attack? It is something I do not want anyone to ever experience again, in this chamber or anywhere else in the world, but unfortunately, it happened.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8378063" data-originallang="en">One starts to wonder if this happened to me, and this also happened to other colleagues in the House of Commons, then clearly, this is also happening within our nation. Who is attempting to obtain what information? How successful are they? How many attacks like this are going on at this time? Worse than that, the Liberal government knew about this attack, yet it did not inform me, and it did not inform my colleagues. It is reprehensible. It is absolutely horrible.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8378064" data-originallang="en"> I would like to thank again the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China for informing myself and my colleagues that we were the targets of such an attack. I would also like to thank the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the United States of America for once again doing the heavy lifting that the Liberal government should be doing. It is shameful that we were informed, through foreign governments, that we were under attack.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8378065" data-originallang="en"> Unfortunately, it is not a surprise to me. It is not a surprise at all because we found out, just this past week, in the foreign interference report that the former member for Steveston—Richmond East was not successful in his election campaign as a result of foreign interference.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8378066" data-originallang="en">Last year, we saw the effects of a foreign government, the same PRC government, on the member for <a data-HoCid="278408" href="/politicians/michael-chong/" title="Michael Chong">Wellington—Halton Hills</a>, who sits in this very aisle. He was also the victim of the interference of a foreign government in an attempt to try to gain information on his family to try to intimidate him.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8378067" data-originallang="en">Unfortunately, I had the honour of being the shadow minister for democratic institutions back in 2018-19. At that time, I begged the member for <a data-HoCid="278511" href="/politicians/karina-gould/" title="Karina Gould">Burlington</a> to do something about it at that time, and it fell upon deaf ears.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8378068" data-originallang="en">We set up things like the Leaders' Debates Commission, which housed a member of the WE Charity scandal. The commission was overseen by the former special rapporteur, who clearly failed in his mission to try to keep this chamber and to keep Canadians safe. We saw the implementation of the toothless digital charter, which achieved nothing to protect Canadians and to protect members of the House.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8378069" data-originallang="en">We spent hours going over Bill <a data-HoCid="9808070" href="/bills/42-1/C-76/" title="An Act to amend the Canada Elections Act and other Acts and to make certain consequential amendments">C-76</a>, where we talked about things like vouching. We talked about things like returning officers. We talked about things like the closing of polls across our nation, yet this did very little to solve the problem that is in front of us now, which is foreign interference.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8378070" data-originallang="en">Once again, it is the absence of responsibility of the Liberal government not only to do something about foreign interference, but also to even have the courtesy, the decency and the moral placement to let members of the House know that they were under attack and under threat. We did not get that courtesy, and it is an absolute shame.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8378071" data-originallang="en">Once again, we have seen that the government has done too little, too late. We see this time and time again. We saw this in 2019, when I would try and raise questions with the member for <a data-HoCid="278511" href="/politicians/karina-gould/" title="Karina Gould">Burlington</a>, with the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister of Canada</a>, and the only response I would receive was that the Prime Minister had an indication that there had been some interference by Russia in the 2015 election, which is very cold comfort at this time, given what we know now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8378072" data-originallang="en"> The 2018-19 election was, my goodness, five years ago now. The Liberals have had five years to do something. Clearly, they have not spent their time doing anything. They are, once again, doing what they do best and that is creating the illusion of doing something when, in fact, they are happy to do nothing because, as we saw with the member for <a data-HoCid="278408" href="/politicians/michael-chong/" title="Michael Chong">Wellington—Halton Hills</a>, as we saw with the member for <a data-HoCid="278593" href="/politicians/parm-bains/" title="Parm Bains">Steveston—Richmond East</a>, it benefits them to do nothing, so they have done nothing, and they will keep doing nothing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8378073" data-originallang="en"> Even if I blame the member for <a data-HoCid="278511" href="/politicians/karina-gould/" title="Karina Gould">Burlington</a>, I know that this direction was from the top. There is no doubt in my mind that this direction was from the top, and the same thing here. I am sure that the Liberals wanted to ignore the cyber-attack and that they wanted to ignore the potential harm it could have caused me, my family and 17 other members of the House. They wanted to turn a blind eye to that because that is what they do. They do not want to take responsibility for the types of atrocities that take place against myself, against other members of the House and against the Canadian people.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8378074" data-originallang="en"> The good news about this is that this will not deter myself, and this will not deter the <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">leader of the official opposition</a> from continuing to stand up for democracy, human rights and the rule of law, not only in this nation, but also across the world as well. Members will continue to see us standing side by side with our allies in Taiwan, in Israel and in Ukraine. Once again, this is something that we do not see the Liberal government doing. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8378075" data-originallang="en">We see the government picking and choosing winners and losers, speaking out of both sides of its mouth, again, not only to the harm of people in the House, not only to the harm of Canadians, but also to the harm of people across the world. As I said, that is because this government will always turn a blind eye. Do members know what happens when we turn a blind eye? Evil prevails. Evil prevails in the House when the current government turns a blind eye. Evil prevails across this country when the government is not willing to take responsibility, as I begged the member for <a data-HoCid="278511" href="/politicians/karina-gould/" title="Karina Gould">Burlington</a> to do all those years ago; and evil prevails across the globe. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8378076" data-originallang="en">It is not a surprise that I was informed, after the fact, that this government had neglected its responsibility to keep our citizens safe and to keep members of this chamber safe, who were informed by a foreign entity, by someone else doing the work that the Liberals should be doing. Shame on them for trying to hide it from us and for keeping it from us. Once again, they would know, Canadians would know, that they had shirked their responsibility and that they had not done what they were supposed to do in overseeing the safety of the House and the safety of the members of the House.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8378077" data-originallang="en"> As I said, I have, unfortunately, seen this time and time again, so it is not a surprise to me at all that we were left in this position and that we were left as targets of this foreign government and other foreign governments that are looking into us. I am not naive. I was in the Canadian foreign service, now elected to the House, and I understand that, I am sure, I will always be a target for those foreign governments. However, this government was informed by another government and was informed by another organization that is attempting to do the work that the Liberals should be doing, which is keeping Canadians safe and keeping members of the House safe. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8378078" data-originallang="en"> We can refer this matter to PROC. I certainly hope that we do, but I hope it is with greater results than the previous times, when we saw Bill <a data-HoCid="9808070" href="/bills/42-1/C-76/" title="An Act to amend the Canada Elections Act and other Acts and to make certain consequential amendments">C-76</a> come out of PROC with no shield for the members of the House and no shield for Canadians. I hope, this time, that the Liberal government takes foreign interference seriously, does not pretend and actually does something about it.</p>
