<p data-HoCid="8499019" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8499020" data-originallang="fr">I thank all the witnesses with us this morning: Mr. Brown and, by video conference, Mr. Ahmed and Ms. Hasan.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8499021" data-originallang="fr">Islamophobia is an important and serious issue. I'm proud to be a member of this committee, which has decided to hear witnesses and report on the situation. Like my entire party, the Bloc Québécois, I believe that all forms of hatred should be rejected, that living together in harmony means respecting one another, regardless of religion, race, colour, political, cultural or other opinion, sexual orientation or gender. All that belongs to each and every one of us and we must, in my opinion, live with respect for each other's unique identity. Obviously, we reject all forms of hatred.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8499022" data-originallang="fr">That said, I've heard the comments made regarding the issue of online hate. Of course, as you know, we're already looking into that issue, and a bill is currently being drafted.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8499023" data-originallang="fr">My party, the Bloc Québécois, has tabled a bill to remove the religious exceptions set out the Criminal Code. In a nutshell, the Criminal Code prohibits the promotion of antisemitism or hatred, but provides for exceptions, two of which state that, if it's based on a religious text, it can be done. I'll spare you the details, but in our opinion, it shouldn't exist.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8499024" data-originallang="fr">I'd like to hear your thoughts on that, Mr. Brown. Should we remove the religious exception set out in the section of the Criminal Code prohibiting the promotion of hatred or should we keep that exception?</p>
