<p data-HoCid="8679166" data-originallang="fr">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679167" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Allen, on October 9, 2023, an article appeared in the Toronto Star following the October 7 massacre.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679168" data-originallang="en">The article was titled, “The violence between Israelis and Palestinians will not end until each side recognizes the other’s legitimacy”. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679169" data-originallang="fr">In it, you stated that in the current circumstances, the two-state solution was less and less possible.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679170" data-originallang="fr">Today, you began your remarks by saying that the two-state solution was the only solution.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679171" data-originallang="fr">Could you help us reconcile these two positions?</p>
