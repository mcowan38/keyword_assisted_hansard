<p data-HoCid="8564495" data-originallang="en"> Madam Speaker, I can imagine the Liberals are quite upset that we broke an agreement with them, but frankly, right now we are disappointed in so many of the things that the Liberal government has done.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8564496" data-originallang="en">Let me be clear. I am not interested in supporting the Conservatives in any possible way, but when I look at the Canada disability benefit, with the laughable small amount that the Liberals brought forward for it; when I look at OAS and their failure to meet the needs of seniors in this country; and when I look at the way they have failed time and time again to meet the truth and reconciliation that this country is required to do, those are huge issues. Then, to top it all off, when I look at their foreign affairs failures, with their lack of clarity and lack of courage in recognizing the state of Palestine, it has become incredibly difficult for us to continue to support them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8564497" data-originallang="en">They can continue to earn our vote. That is fine. However, we are done working with them.</p>
