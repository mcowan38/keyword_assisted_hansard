<p data-HoCid="6326753" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6326754" data-originallang="fr">First, as the subcommittee on agenda and procedure discussed at its meeting, we should be trying to find a way to meet twice a week after the break week. That is essential given the workload.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6326755" data-originallang="fr">Second, on the motion to have an extra hour with the ministers, could someone please remind me, for my own benefit, what explicitly was sought.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6326756" data-originallang="fr">Last, I didn't want to bring this up, but who is formally representing the NDP today, for the purposes of the committee's proceedings? Is it Ms. Gazan or Ms. Kwan?</p>
