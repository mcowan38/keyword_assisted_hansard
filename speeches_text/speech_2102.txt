<p data-HoCid="7602154" data-originallang="fr">On September 12, 2022, the <em>National Post</em> reported remarks by the minister that this incident represented a system failure. He promised that a host of measures would be put in place to ensure that this doesn't happen again.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7602155" data-originallang="fr"> One of the things he mentioned was that there would be audit training for program officers. In addition, officers would be required to review each funding application before it is approved. These officers would receive training in reviewing the social media accounts of organizations and individuals, as well as diversity and inclusion training, including anti-racism and anti-Semitism awareness training. The minister went on to say that if an organization had its funding withdrawn, it would no longer be eligible for funding from Canadian Heritage. The minister concluded by stating that candidates should commit to taking steps to create an environment free from harassment, abuse and discrimination.</p>
