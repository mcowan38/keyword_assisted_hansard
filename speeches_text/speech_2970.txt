<p data-HoCid="8027942" data-originallang="en"> Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8027943" data-originallang="en">Thank you for being here at this important discussion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8027944" data-originallang="en">As you cited—and I think Ms. Hepfner asked the question—a Conservative member of this committee stated, in the most irresponsible and incendiary way possible, that CBC journalists were on the side of terrorists. She has not apologized. She has not in any way taken responsibility for those appalling comments. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8027945" data-originallang="en">I note that 33 journalists or members of the media have been killed so far in Israel and Gaza. They were covering the war. You mentioned, in your opening statement, the issue of the physical safety of your journalists. Do you feel comments like that in any way contribute to an environment where journalists' safety may be put in peril? </p>
