<p data-HoCid="6031095" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, this past Monday was International Holocaust Remembrance Day, when we remembered the murder of over six million Jews during World War II. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6031096" data-originallang="en">This year also marked the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6031097" data-originallang="en"> On Monday, at Auschwitz-Birkenau, I joined the Governor General, a multi-partisan group of MPs and over 200 holocaust survivors to mark this solemn day. The memory of the over one million Jews murdered there, relived on Monday through the testimony of those who survived, must never be forgotten.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6031098" data-originallang="en"> On Monday, survivor Marian Turski urged the world to adopt an 11th commandment, “Thou shalt not be indifferent.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="6031099" data-originallang="en"> For their legacy and ours, we must fight against a resurgence of anti-Semitism and xenophobia and ensure that our vow of “never again” is matched by our commitment to combat anti-Semitism and hatred in all its forms wherever it rears its ugly head.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6031100" data-originallang="en">Let us each pledge, this day and every day, to never be indifferent.</p>
