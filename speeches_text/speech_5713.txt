<p data-HoCid="8783119" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8783120" data-originallang="fr">Thank you for being with us today, Minister.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8783121" data-originallang="fr">The Bloc Québécois has introduced Bill <a data-HoCid="12830843" href="/bills/44-1/C-373/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (promotion of hatred or antisemitism)">C‑373</a> which proposes to eliminate the religious exemptions provided in paragraphs 319(3)(b) and (319)(3.1)(b) of the Criminal Code. I would like to know your opinion on that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8783122" data-originallang="fr">Can we expect that your government will take up that bill, or support it, before the end of the current Parliament?</p>
