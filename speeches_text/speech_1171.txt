<p data-HoCid="6814065" data-originallang="en">All right.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6814066" data-originallang="en">I just want to say this. Further to what I said previously about this motion that's before us that Pam originally put forward, Chair, I look at this and it's so incredibly important that we hear this, but there's no action on here. There's no action from this motion that says what the committee is going to do with any of the information that we have or information that we're going to gather.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6814067" data-originallang="en">What I would encourage through Joël, as the PS to the public safety minister, is to go back to the <a data-HoCid="253386" href="/politicians/bill-blair/" title="Bill Blair">minister</a> and say that if we want action, because Canadians want action on this.... It might give us a warm feeling to have a conversation, but Canadians are looking for something that keeps them safe in their communities and we need to deal with this. I would encourage the minister and the government to meet with these groups and to action some things that we're not going to get actioned by hearing them at committee and then not giving anything to the government to action. That's what I'm getting at.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6814068" data-originallang="en">It's so critically important that we hear from these groups and we try to figure out some concrete plans, but in the short term this committee is handcuffed by time and the fact that Parliament won't be sitting in the summer to action the items that we hear. The government can. That's what I would encourage be done if we want to hear on IMVE and we want to hear from the Islamic groups and from the Jewish groups on what they're experiencing and what recommendations they would have.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6814069" data-originallang="en">That's my suggestion, Chair, and to Joël. Maybe that's an avenue where we can actually have these groups heard so that we could action some of those things, because what we hear now is there's no time. We're prisoners to the time that we have left.</p>
