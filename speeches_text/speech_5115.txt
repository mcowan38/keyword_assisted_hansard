<p data-HoCid="8663394" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8663395" data-originallang="en"> I want to start by saying that my sympathies are with you, Ms. Diab and Mr. El-Khoury, and all of those Lebanese Canadian and Lebanese people who are suffering right now. I know how worried the community is. I know how worried you are for your loved ones and for the country of Lebanon. I wanted to express that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8663396" data-originallang="en"> I also want to make it very clear that what Hezbollah and Hamas are doing is obviously terrorist. They are obvious terrorist organizations, and they are, obviously, being armed by another terrorist entity, which is the Iranian regime. That said, I have some questions about the behaviour of Israel. The Financial Times has reported that Israel has used the incendiary chemical white phosphorus in attacks on a UN base, which has injured 15 peacekeepers.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8663397" data-originallang="en"> Can you confirm these reports? </p>
