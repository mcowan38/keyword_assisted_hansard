<p data-HoCid="6439386" data-originallang="en">Thank you to all of the witnesses, first for hanging around and waiting for us and then for being so patient and so comprehensive in your answers this evening. We very much appreciate it. It will greatly aid the work we're doing here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6439387" data-originallang="en">Colleagues, the support team from the House of Commons—the clerk, the analysts, the translators, the people in the room—have put in some extra time to allow us to have such an excellent meeting. We don't say this often enough: Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6439388" data-originallang="en">Colleagues, I think we're ready to adjourn. Is there anything else anyone needs to raise?</p>
