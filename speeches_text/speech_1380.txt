<p data-HoCid="6926368" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6926369" data-originallang="en">Before I get to my questions, I want to inform committee members that I want to read a notice of motion into the record.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6926370" data-originallang="en">The notice of motion is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="6926371" data-originallang="en"> That the Committee invite representatives from GoFundMe to appear as soon as possible to answer questions regarding security measures the company has in place to ensure the funds are not being used to promote extremism, white supremacy, anti-Semitism and other forms of hate, which have been expressed among prominent organizers for the truck convoy currently in Ottawa, including: </p>
<p data-HoCid="6926372" data-originallang="en"> a) how the company prevents the use of anonymity to funnel money to extremist groups; </p>
<p data-HoCid="6926373" data-originallang="en"> b) what measures are in place to prevent foreign funds from being used to support these views, and to the subgroups that have expressed an intent to put in place their own undemocratic government; and </p>
<p data-HoCid="6926374" data-originallang="en"> c) what measures and assurances are in place to ensure the $1 million that has already been released is not going towards promoting any of the forms of the aforementioned unacceptable views and activities. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="6926375" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, that's the notice of motion I've put on the record. I understand that it would require the unanimous consent of the committee for this motion to be moved today. Given the displays of anti-Semitism and harassment we have seen over the past week in the city of Ottawa and some of the extremist behaviour, I was wondering if my colleagues would give unanimous consent for me to move this motion today and to have a quick vote on it.</p>
