<p data-HoCid="7265101" data-originallang="en">Oh boy, Mr. Israel, I think you might have touched the third rail when you talked about the World Economic Forum, in this context. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7265102" data-originallang="en">I have an interest in your report. You talked about how some evidence suggests that Canadian border control agencies appear to be unaware of racial biases inherent in these systems. What little public information is available suggests these capabilities may have been assessed for general levels of inaccuracy but not for racial bias. I'll reference the ongoing saga of the no-fly lists for kids. In this country, we literally have children being flagged, identified and put on no-fly lists because they might have Muslim-sounding names. They are caught up in some kind of bureaucratic nightmare, quite frankly, when trying to travel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7265103" data-originallang="en">Can you talk about the risks posed by that lack of awareness about racial bias, particularly in terms of having human guardrails in place to help offset some of these inconsistencies and inaccuracies?</p>
