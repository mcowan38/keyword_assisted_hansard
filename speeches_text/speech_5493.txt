<p data-HoCid="8714979" data-originallang="fr">Okay. Thank you for that clarification.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714980" data-originallang="fr">You're asking a question that is eminently political.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714981" data-originallang="fr">As I explained earlier, our role is really to give advice, particularly on the ins and outs, the pros and cons. The decision of the moment rests with the government, and it's up to them to make that decision.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714982" data-originallang="fr"> I would just say that words are important, especially when a large number of countries unite to say the same words. We should not underestimate the pressure that can be brought to bear by all the G7 countries speaking out, for example, on the release of funds that are being preserved by the Israeli government, even though they belong to the Palestinian Authority.</p>
