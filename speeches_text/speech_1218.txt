<p data-HoCid="6833283" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6833284" data-originallang="en">I appreciate the remarks from Madam Chabot and the support from Madam Gazan. I'm glad to see that we can work together across partisan lines, towards a common good.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6833285" data-originallang="en">Mr. Vaughan, I think you have really great questions. I would just say that the Bloc bill is very good at 50 weeks, but from our perspective and the work we've been doing internally with our party, it's just been 52. That one-year rounding out is a really nice symbolic gesture for those who really need the support. That's the motivation behind our amendment.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6833286" data-originallang="en">The chair has ruled it inadmissible. I understand his ruling, and we won't be challenging the chair on this, but we do wish we could have made it 52 weeks.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6833287" data-originallang="en">Again, we thank the Bloc for its work on this.</p>
