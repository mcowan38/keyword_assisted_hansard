<p data-HoCid="6728992" data-originallang="en"> Good day, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6728993" data-originallang="en"> I am Major-General Guy Chapdelaine. Since 2015, I have served as the Canadian Armed Forces chaplain general.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6728994" data-originallang="en">The mission of the Royal Canadian chaplain service is to develop and offer spiritual and religious care and support in order to ensure the spiritual well-being and resilience of all members of the defence community and Canadian Armed Forces families while respecting the freedom of conscience and religion of each person.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6728995" data-originallang="en">My role as the Canadian Armed Forces chaplain general is to oversee chaplain recruiting and training and to set direction and guidance for the provision of religious and spiritual care in accordance with Canada's defence strategy and the initiatives of the Canadian Armed Forces total health and wellness strategy. In addition to leading the chaplaincy, I advise the chief of the defence staff on religious, spiritual and moral issues affecting defence team members and Canadian Armed Forces members' families.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6728996" data-originallang="en">Chaplains have privileged access to Canadian Armed Forces members of all ranks, having no command authority while ensuring that privacy and confidentiality are respected. Chaplains provide an active and supportive presence and offer spiritual and personal growth counselling, a variety of programs, and special events throughout the year across Canada and the globe. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6728997" data-originallang="fr">The Royal Canadian Chaplain Service has undergone many important changes in recent years, notably to ensure and promote diversity among its ranks, including representation of women and a variety of spiritual beliefs.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6728998" data-originallang="fr"> The Royal Canadian Chaplain Service is comprised of 261 Regular Force chaplains, and 125 Primary Reserve chaplains. Chaplains serve in all elements of the Canadian Armed Forces both domestically and abroad. Eighteen per cent of regular force chaplains are women, and 16% of Primary Reserve chaplains are women. Currently, within our subsidized education program, which is part of chaplain recruiting, 30% of candidates are women.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6728999" data-originallang="en">Until 1995, there were two chaplaincy services: one Protestant and one Roman Catholic. In 2003 we welcomed our first Muslim chaplain. Today we are a multi-faith chaplaincy, representing many different traditions: Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Sikh, Buddhist, and soon, Humanist. We understand that we must continue to build upon this progress, creating a safe work environment for female chaplains, as well as ensuring that the CAF members we serve receive tailored support. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6729000" data-originallang="en">I am pleased to be in your midst to answer your questions.</p>
