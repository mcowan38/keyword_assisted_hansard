<p data-HoCid="8405964" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much for being here. I asked for this study to happen. I moved this motion for this study because I believe the vast majority of Canadians are good and care very much about our Jewish communities and they don't understand what's happening on campus.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405965" data-originallang="en"> I was very much hoping for a non-partisan study that would allow the voices of Jewish students to come forward. That was what these meetings were meant to do and that's what I intend to use my time and my questions to ask for. I want to hear about your experiences.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8405966" data-originallang="en"> Ms. Nashen, when you see a sign at your campus at the encampment, which McGill has declared on multiple occasions is in violation of McGill's code of conduct, that reads, “No Zionists allowed”, do you feel welcome at McGill?</p>
