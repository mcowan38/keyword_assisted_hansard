<p data-HoCid="6708312" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I rise today to lend my voice to a Palestinian Canadian. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6708313" data-originallang="en">These are her words:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="6708314" data-originallang="en"> What we see in Sheikh Jarrah, Gaza, and all of Palestine is not new. Decades of Israel's dehumanizing occupation has robbed: Palestinian children of their youth, parents of their children, children of their parents, and elders of their dignity. Palestinian deaths must be understood as vanished dreams and mourning families, not merely as statistics. Israel is forcefully removing Palestinian families from their homes, demolishing their neighbourhoods, expanding illegal settlements, and desecrating our places of worship. The necessity to put pressure on Israel to stop these human rights violations is long overdue. Canada must show courage and act now. As a start, we must stop the sale of arms to Israel. Because Palestinian lives matter. Hear us: our lives matter. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="6708315" data-originallang="en">Those in the House who speak up will be remembered. Those who stay silent will be remembered. History will never forget.</p>
