<p data-HoCid="8386066" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8386067" data-originallang="en">I would just remind the honourable member that the six minutes are mine, and I can use them as I wish.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8386068" data-originallang="en">This was a really important motion that I brought forward today, and I am confused as to why the Liberals wouldn't grant unanimous consent when we have evidence there is anti-Semitic rhetoric and conduct taking place on university campuses across this country. The Liberal government has signed off on, and committed to, a Canada anti-racism strategy, and it is incumbent upon the <a data-HoCid="300004" href="/politicians/pascale-st-onge/" title="Pascale St-Onge">Minister of Canadian Heritage</a> to abide by her mandate, which is to foster and promote Canadian identity and values, cultural development and heritage. I would certainly hope that anti-Semitism does not belong within the definition of that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8386069" data-originallang="en">There was an opportunity here today for us all to agree to something that seems quite collaborative in nature. All of us should agree that it is wrong to perpetuate hate toward the Jewish community in Canada, and I'm confused and grieved, actually, by the fact that I wasn't given unanimous consent to move that motion forward today. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8386070" data-originallang="en">That's me, but further to that, I'm concerned about the Jewish community and I'm concerned about how the current government that's in power treats that community. I'll leave it there for now.</p>
