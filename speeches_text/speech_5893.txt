<p data-HoCid="8778174" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, there is not a single time that the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> rises in the House and does not impart to us what she has learned, with lessons, teachings and things we should be taking away. In her remarks, she talked about the genocidal settler colonial project that is really about the displacement of first nations, MÃ©tis, indigenous and Inuit peoples from their lands.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8778175" data-originallang="en">When no levels of government provide adequate funding, the result is that people have to leave their home territories to go to cities to seek services, health care and education. They not only lose their connection to their original homelands, but they also end up living in precarity and in what I will call the social murder of homelessness.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8778176" data-originallang="en">Can the member comment on how the settler colonial project and genocidal logics are not an event that happens but a process of land displacement? Can she reflect on purposeful government underfunding of nations in a nation-to-nation relationship that results in people leaving their home territories?</p>
