<p data-HoCid="7979402" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7979403" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Ms. O'Connell, for assisting the committee with that clarification of the rules. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7979404" data-originallang="en">I will just start from the beginning the notice of motion I was reading so that there is clarity about what it says:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7979405" data-originallang="en"> That the committee recognize the rise in hateful attacks against people of faith and the places where they worship in Canada, affirm the constitutionally protected right to freedom of religion and call upon the government to immediately increase protection for synagogues, mosques and churches in Canada, and that this be reported to the House. </p>
