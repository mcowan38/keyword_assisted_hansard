<p data-HoCid="6528870" data-originallang="en">You're absolutely right. There's research coming out of Israel that has been interpreted as potentially being information that would talk to transmissibility. The research in Israel was really around viral shedding. What they found was that there was a decrease in viral load in those people, so they would shed less virus, and then the conclusion was that potentially they would be less transmissible. I think that's an interesting hypothesis. We still don't know exactly how that correlates, the amount of the virus you shed or what type of virus it is, or what phase, and how that directly translates to transmissibility. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6528871" data-originallang="en">Whether it's for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, whether it's for Moderna, that has some data around potential decreasing of asymptomatic spread, as well as AstraZeneca that shows in some studies that potentially it's about a 66% decrease in asymptomatic transmission. I think we'll have some data on the vaccines, but for all of them, it's not yet conclusive. Really, the studies have been designed to look at decreasing and preventing serious illness, moderate illness and death. We know that for the vaccines that we have under review and have authorized, they all have very good outcomes there, but again, the transmission and the effect on the transmission is still an ongoing area of research.</p>
