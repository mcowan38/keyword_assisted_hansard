<p data-HoCid="6017202" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, this is not simply a matter of another Liberal foreign policy train wreck to be shrugged off. Canada has broken faith with the only democracy in the Middle East, given comfort to tyrants and hatemongers, and betrayed the Canadian Jewish community after offering election campaign promises of solidarity, as when the member for <a data-HoCid="252672" href="/politicians/anthony-housefather/" title="Anthony Housefather">Mount Royal</a> earnestly offered that the Liberal record spoke for itself. Yes, it does.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6017203" data-originallang="en"> Is this faithlessness of Liberal Canadian foreign policy merely in reckless pursuit of tainted Security Council votes?</p>
