<p data-HoCid="7300281" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, Sunday night marks the beginning of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year. It is a time for new beginnings. It is one of the most sacred days in the Jewish calendar, the first of the high holy days and the 10-day period of repentance in which Jewish people around the world reflect on our faith. It is a time for our families to come together and celebrate the gifts of the past year, reset, refocus and look forward with anticipation and hope to the year ahead. It is also a time for our country to recommit to fighting the alarming rise in pernicious hatred against a Jewish minority.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7300282" data-originallang="en">To all of those celebrating Rosh Hashanah in Thornhill and across the country, <em>shanah tova</em> to them and their families. On behalf of Canada's Conservatives, we wish them a healthy, peaceful, prosperous and sweet new year.</p>
