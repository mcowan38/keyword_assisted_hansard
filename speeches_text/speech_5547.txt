<p data-HoCid="8733925" data-originallang="fr">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733926" data-originallang="fr">Ms. Grant, I'll continue with you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733927" data-originallang="fr">Earlier, you talked about the infringement of freedom of expression in the context of demonstrations, particularly in the context of pro-Palestinian demonstrations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733928" data-originallang="fr">Do you think it's possible that certain pro-Palestinian demonstrations were infiltrated by pro-Hamas elements and that slogans calling for the destruction of Israel were chanted not only by these elements, but by the demonstrators as a whole?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733929" data-originallang="fr">Could this have justified a slightly more forceful intervention at this point?</p>
