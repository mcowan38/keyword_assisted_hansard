<p data-HoCid="7293371" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, there are certain days in history when the world stops and listens, and everyone remembers where they were when they heard the tragic news of what happened that day. For some of my colleagues, it may be the day that John F. Kennedy was assassinated. For others, it may be when Princess Diana died or 9/11. Those days, however, feel far away from our lives and they are, in part. They are a product of shock that invokes the need for answers to explain the circumstances around those days. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7293372" data-originallang="en">Those events feel far away, but in some way resemble the day that we learned of the death of the Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. It is one of those moments in history that many will never forget. For many Canadians, her passing did not feel far away. Though it might have been in terms of physical distance, to many of us it felt closer.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7293373" data-originallang="en">Like those other tragic events of years past, the passing of our Queen, the Queen of Canada, will be remembered because we lost more than a person. We lost part of an idea. We lost a symbol. We lost someone whom we considered our own. When the news came of her passing, I felt in a sense like I would with the passing of someone I knew, someone who was present, like a family member, distant or close, whose quiet and constant company was simply always there.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7293374" data-originallang="en">Of course, I am not related to the Queen. I never even met her and neither did millions of other Canadians who now grieve alongside us today. We felt that the Queen was like family, because we saw family in her. Like family, she was there at the highest of the highs and the lowest of the lows supporting us with steadfast love and encouragement. She represented not who we were, but who we could be. She wanted us to be the best versions of ourselves. I truly believe that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7293375" data-originallang="en">Like family, the Queen taught us about what it meant to serve others. She lived a life of selfless devotion not only to those she loved, but also to many who never met her and who never knew her. She encouraged tolerance, respect and understanding, the things that we strive for. Like family, she was always there for us whether we realized it or not. All the things changing today, our money, our legal system, our armed forces and even Parliament itself, are evidence of just how many ways she touched our lives. Sometimes, as with many of our own family members, we took that for granted.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7293376" data-originallang="en">She was the only sovereign that most Canadians ever knew. As we have grown older over the years, the Queen seemed trapped in time. The tributes that she received over many jubilees and anniversaries showed us that we knew what we had. The truth is we never thought we would lose it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7293377" data-originallang="en">It is no secret that those who know me know of my respect for the monarchy. It is rooted in tradition and respect for this institution. Our monarchy separates politics from service and popularity from the institution. After nearly a year in this place, I have never been more convinced that unity may be a product of the monarchy and not any political head of government. It is consistent and it forces a respect. Without it, that may not always be upheld.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7293378" data-originallang="en"> Her Majesty toured this country more than 20 times over 70 years, showing an extraordinary dedication for our people and our nation. She has a special place in the hearts of many in my own community, even more so than most across the country would know. Let me tell members why.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7293379" data-originallang="en">She was the first female monarch of the royal family to be an active-duty member of the British armed forces serving as a mechanic during the Second World War. She not only helped the empire by using her hands, but she also helped by using her heart. She was a quiet, steadfast figure of optimism and perseverance, encouraging people to keep calm and carry on. She was a symbol that someday, somehow, things would get better even if we did not know how or when.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7293380" data-originallang="en">She inspired a nation trapped in the darkest days to overcome and overturn the Nazi regime in Europe. In doing so, she helped liberate millions trapped in concentration camps across the continent whose descendants would grow up to be my friends, my family and my constituents.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7293381" data-originallang="en">Her service did not stop there. It speaks volumes about the Queen's character that she continued to hear stories of survivors through the 70 years as a monarch. It would have been easy to forget these individuals as many contemporary leaders did, but she took it upon herself as a leader to bring closure and healing to deeply scarred lives. She used her position of privilege to educate others about a dark period in history and so personified the mantra that we, the living, try to personify every day: never again.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7293382" data-originallang="en">There is a royal tradition that has been passed down over centuries. The monarch is never late and, as a rule, that is how it was with the Queen. On January 27, 2005, she met with survivors at the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, and yet when the time ran out, there were still many in a large group who had yet to meet her. Instead of leaving, Her Majesty stayed, giving each survivor her undivided and deliberate focus. One of the Queen's attendants remarked to the late Rabbi Lord Sacks, who was present that day, that he had never seen her stay so late after the time had come for her to go, breaking such a hallowed custom. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7293383" data-originallang="en">We are extremely fortunate to have witnessed Queen Elizabeth II dedicate over seven decades, more than a lifetime for many, to the cause of our Commonwealth and the betterment of our country. Although the Queen may have passed, the spirit and joy and the feeling of love that she left with millions will never die. The legacy of her service will live on forever in the hearts of many grateful Canadians, including this member.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7293384" data-originallang="en">As we look to the future, I continue to believe that the monarchy is an important check to constitutional power being given to any bureaucracy or any government of the day. It is a humbling reminder that in this place, we work on behalf of people and the person who is entrusted with that role is reminded of the ideals and the traditions that were here long before any of us.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7293385" data-originallang="en">With that, I offer my deepest condolences to the royal family and to all of the people of the Commonwealth as they mourn the loss of Her Majesty. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7293386" data-originallang="en">God rest the Queen and, finally, God save the King.</p>
