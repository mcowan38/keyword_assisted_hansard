<p data-HoCid="8391241" data-originallang="en"> I had some phone calls and some emails and some text messages about this, because immediately after it was introduced, the member opposite went onto social media and made the claim that we were standing in the way of fighting anti-Semitism. That was really disheartening for me as someone who's dedicated most of his professional career in politics to fighting racism and all forms of hate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8391242" data-originallang="en"> I just want to bring clarity to this issue, because we're not playing games here. These are real-life situations in which people are being hurt and people are being discriminated against. The toxic level of hate is rising in this country. I need to speak to this, because what happened was that a week and a half ago, the member introduced this motion out of nowhere in the middle of a study we were doing. I believe it was a study. In the motion, there were some questions that one would naturally ask. For example, it makes reference to policies at York University. I have never seen these policies at York University. I know that there's a current lawsuit. I did some research. There's a current lawsuit that's being aimed at York University about this issue, and there are probably lots of documents that speak to these issues.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8391243" data-originallang="en">For the member to ask me to condemn a university without seeing any of the information.... This was a National Post article I saw that the member referred to. The first time I ever heard of it was the day that the member opposite introduced itâ€”</p>
