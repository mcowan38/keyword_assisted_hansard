<p data-HoCid="8173165" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8173166" data-originallang="en">Before the amendment is brought to debate, as chair, I again must give a ruling on the admissibility of said amendment.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8173167" data-originallang="en">Again, Bill <a data-HoCid="12260777" href="/bills/44-1/C-318/" title="An Act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and the Canada Labour Code (adoptive and intended parents)">C-318</a> amends the Canada Labour Code to introduce a new type of special benefit to extend parental leave in the case of the transfer of a child through adoption or a child born through surrogacy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8173168" data-originallang="en"> The amendment attempts to create another benefit whereby an indigenous child could be placed with an employee other than the child's parents, following processes different from the provincial adoption process that was indicated in the bill, and the employee could be entitled to an extended parental leave. As <em>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</em>, third edition, states on page 770, “An amendment to a bill that was referred to a committee after second reading is out of order if it is beyond the scope and principle of the bill.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8173169" data-originallang="en">In the opinion of the chair, the amendment introduces a new concept that is beyond the scope of the bill as agreed by the House at second reading. Therefore, I rule the amendment inadmissible.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8173170" data-originallang="en">Go ahead, Ms. Gazan.</p>
