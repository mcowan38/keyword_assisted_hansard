<p data-HoCid="6326713" data-originallang="en">I understand Ms. Kwan's desire to challenge the chair, but she's not a member of the committee. Ms. Gazan is the NDP member. I think before we get into a debate further on, that if somebody needs to challenge the chair, it should be Ms. Gazan, not Ms. Kwan. </p>
