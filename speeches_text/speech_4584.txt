<p data-HoCid="8498993" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8498994" data-originallang="en">I would like to thank all the witnesses for being here in person and online today. Thank you for joining us. We recognize your strength, courage and advocacy, especially around this three-year mark of the tragedy in London, Ontario, where the Afzaal family was so hurt, the London community also was hurt and lives were lost.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8498995" data-originallang="en"> I want to talk about the lessons that we have or haven't learned.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8498996" data-originallang="en"> We today are marking three years of the Afzaal family's passing and the impacts that happened to the community there in London, Ontario. We'll fast-forward to today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8498997" data-originallang="en"> Just last week, here in Ottawa, in what isn't necessarily a unique situation, there was an assault that happened. A man was captured on video punching a woman in the face, knocking her to the ground, if I remember correctly. This lady was specifically protesting, from all appearances, what's happening—and her objection to what's happening—within Gaza. Do you have any comments on that situation in terms of that assault and the aftermath of it?</p>
