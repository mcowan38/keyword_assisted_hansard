<p data-HoCid="8598608" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, the Government of Canada is firm in its stand against hate and against terrorism. As a government, we are deeply concerned by the issue of hate against Jewish communities. Anti-Semitism, Islamophobia or hate in any form is unacceptable and has no place in this country. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8598609" data-originallang="en">The government encourages all those affected by hate propaganda to contact law enforcement, as well as local elected officials, if they have safety concerns revolving around hateful speech or actions in a community. As my colleague, the <a data-HoCid="311643" href="/politicians/jennifer-oconnell/" title="Jennifer O'Connell">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Safety</a> reminded the House today, the<a data-HoCid="300017" href="/politicians/dominic-leblanc/" title="Dominic LeBlanc"> minister</a> has already referred the listing of Samidoun to our national security experts and asked for an emergency and urgent review. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8598610" data-originallang="en">As a government, we have taken the action necessary to combat anti-Semitism and other forms of hate in Canada, and we will continue to do so. We will continue this work to keep Canadians safe.</p>
