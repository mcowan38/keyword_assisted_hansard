<p data-HoCid="7341150" data-originallang="en">Of course, we know that poverty has a detrimental impact on physical and mental health. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7341151" data-originallang="en">Ms. Andrich, you talked about working with communities that are on the margins, in particular indigenous communities, many of whom struggle in poverty here in our province. One of the things we've heard about from other witnesses is the importance of taking poverty seriously when we're talking about the mental health of children.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7341152" data-originallang="en">My colleague Leah Gazan, who is the usual member on this committee, has put forward legislation around a guaranteed livable basic income and the need to take concrete action to eliminate poverty in our country. I'm wondering if you think we should be looking at these kinds of measures as a way of also supporting the mental health of young women and young people in our country.</p>
