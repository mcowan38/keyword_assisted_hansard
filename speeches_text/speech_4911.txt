<p data-HoCid="8576720" data-originallang="en"> <em>Uqaqtittiji</em>, I have been listening to the debate, and I am concerned that the Conservatives are equating a call for a ceasefire as an attack on Jewish people. Can the member explain that asking Netanyahu and the extremist government to be held accountable through things such as sanctions is not an act of anti-Semitism and that we are actually looking for peace?</p>
