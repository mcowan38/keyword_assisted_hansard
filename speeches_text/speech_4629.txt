<p data-HoCid="8464963" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I have been authorized to share my time with the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278737" href="/politicians/andreanne-larouche/" title="Andréanne Larouche">Shefford</a>, who does essential work for the Bloc Québécois on issues having to do with seniors. I would like to take this opportunity to remind the government that Bill <a data-HoCid="12261855" href="/bills/44-1/C-319/" title="An Act to amend the Old Age Security Act (amount of full pension)">C‑319</a>, which was introduced by my colleague, was unanimously adopted in committee with good reason. The Bloc Québécois is proposing to increase the amount of the full pension by 10% starting at age 65 and change the way to guaranteed income supplement is calculated to benefit seniors.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8464964" data-originallang="fr">There is a lot of talk about that in my riding. This bill is coming back to the House and the government should make a commitment at some point. We are asking the government to give royal assent to Bill C‑319. In other words, if the bill is blocked again, seniors will understand that the Liberals are once again abandoning them. I am passionate about the cause of seniors, and so I wanted to use my speech on Bill <a data-HoCid="12913297" href="/bills/44-1/C-63/" title="An Act to enact the Online Harms Act, to amend the Criminal Code, the Canadian Human Rights Act and An Act respecting the mandatory reporting of Internet child pornography by persons who provide an Internet service and to make consequential and related amendments to other Acts">C‑63</a> to make a heartfelt plea on behalf of seniors in Quebec and to commend my colleague from Shefford for her work.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8464965" data-originallang="fr">Today we are debating Bill C‑63, which amends a number of laws to tackle two major digital scourges, specifically child pornography, including online child pornography, and hate speech. This legislation was eagerly awaited. We were surprised that it took the government so long to introduce it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8464966" data-originallang="fr">We have been waiting a long time for this bill, especially part 1. The Bloc Québécois has been waiting a long time for such a bill to protect our children and people who are abused and bullied and whose reputations are jeopardized because of all the issues related to pornography. We agree with part 1 of the bill. We even made an offer to the minister. We agree with it so completely, and I believe there is a consensus about that across the House, that I think we should split the bill and pass the first part before the House rises. That way, we could implement everything needed to protect our children, teens and young adults who are currently going through difficult experiences that can change their lives and have a significant negative impact on them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8464967" data-originallang="fr">We agree that parts 2, 3 and 4 need to be discussed and debated, because the whole hate speech component of the bill is important. We agree with the minister on that. It is very important. What is currently happening on the Internet and online is unacceptable. We need to take action, but reaching an agreement on how to deal with this issue is not that easy. We need time and we need to debate it amongst ourselves.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8464968" data-originallang="fr">The Bloc Québécois has a list of witnesses who could enlighten us on how we can improve the situation. We would like to hear from experts who could help us pass the best bill possible in order to protect the public, citizens and groups when it comes to the whole issue of hate speech. We also wonder why the minister, in part 2 of his bill, which deals with hate speech, omitted to include the two clauses of the bill introduced by the member for <a data-HoCid="278267" href="/politicians/yves-francois-blanchet/" title="Yves-François Blanchet">Beloeil—Chambly</a>. I am talking about Bill <a data-HoCid="12734364" href="/bills/44-1/C-367/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (promotion of hatred or antisemitism)">C-367</a>, which proposed removing the protection afforded under the Criminal Code to people who engage in hate speech on a religious basis.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8464969" data-originallang="fr">We are wondering why the minister did not take the opportunity to add these clauses to his bill. These are questions that we have because to us, offering this protection is out of the question. It is out of the question to let someone use religion as an excuse to make gestures, accusations or even very threatening comments on the Internet under these sections of the Criminal Code. We are asking the minister to listen. The debates in the House and in committee are very polarized right now. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8464970" data-originallang="fr">It would be extremely sad and very disappointing if we passed this bill so quickly that there was no time to debate it in order to improve it and make it the best bill it can be.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8464971" data-originallang="fr">I can say that the Bloc Québécois is voting in favour of the bill at second reading. As I said, it is a complex bill. We made a proposal to the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>. We wrote to him and the leader. We also talked to the <a data-HoCid="299996" href="/politicians/arif-virani/" title="Arif Virani">Minister of Justice</a> to tell him to split the bill as soon as possible. That way, we could quickly protect the survivors who testified at the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics in the other Parliament. These people said that their life is unbearable, and they talked about the consequences they are suffering from being victims of sites such as Pornhub. They were used without their consent. Intimate images of them were posted without their consent. We are saying that we need to protect the people currently going through this by quickly adopting part 1. The committee could then study part 2 and hear witnesses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8464972" data-originallang="fr">I know that the member for <a data-HoCid="278348" href="/politicians/martin-champoux/" title="Martin Champoux">Drummond</a> and the member for <a data-HoCid="278406" href="/politicians/kristina-michaud/" title="Kristina Michaud">Avignon—La Mitis—Matane—Matapédia</a> raised this idea during committee of the whole on May 23. They tried to convince the <a data-HoCid="299996" href="/politicians/arif-virani/" title="Arif Virani">minister</a>, but he is still refusing to split the bill. We think that is a very bad idea. We want to repeat our offer. We do not really understand why he is so reluctant to do so. There is nothing partisan about what the Bloc Québécois is proposing. Our focus is on protecting victims on various platforms.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8464973" data-originallang="fr">In closing, I know that the leaders are having discussions to finalize when the House will rise for the summer. Maybe fast-tracking a bill like this one could be part of the negotiations. However, I repeat that we are appealing to the Minister of Justice's sense of responsibility. I know he cares a lot about victims and their cause. We are sincerely asking him to postpone the passage of parts 2, 3 and 4, so that we can have more time to debate them in committee. Most importantly, we want to pass part 1 before the House rises for the summer so that we can protect people who are going through a really hard time right now because their private lives have been exposed online and they cannot get web platforms to taken down their image, their photo or photos of their private parts.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8464974" data-originallang="fr">We are appealing to the minister's sense of responsibility.</p>
