<p data-HoCid="8300534" data-originallang="en">Thank you to all of my colleagues around the table for asking so many excellent questions about the process involved in getting people out of Gaza at this point in time, because it is a mix that we cannot figure out right now, and many people are dialing our offices saying that they're stuck in the process. So thank you, everyone, for your questions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300535" data-originallang="en">I do need to ask some questions about Sudan as well. With respect here to everybody who's come here representing people in Gaza, thank you for all of your questions today. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8300536" data-originallang="en">On Sudan, how do you get to 3,250 applicants available to come to Canada from Sudan, first of all?</p>
