<p data-HoCid="7757667" data-originallang="en">To me, it's a good problem to have. If we're developing intellectual property that people want to buy, we're starting from a good place. I think the goal of trying to get to more Canadian ownership is a good, solid goal. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7757668" data-originallang="en">As to where we are right now, my own research in the “AI at Scale” report, which I've provided to our clerk to share with all of you, shows that we're not on par with the United States or China. However, they're not our peers. We're on par with Israel, and we're on par with France. We're ahead of most of the other G7 countries, so we're not starting from a bad place.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7757669" data-originallang="en">We want to get better, but even now, when we have start-ups, let's say, being bought by American companies, there's money coming into Canada. That money is coming in through entrepreneurs, who now have what they call a liquidity event, and they are becoming angel investors. I think we can do more to encourage that money. I mentioned entrepreneurs and role models, and there's an opportunity there.</p>
