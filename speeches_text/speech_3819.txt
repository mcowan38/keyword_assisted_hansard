<p data-HoCid="8300588" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Brunelleâ€‘Duceppe, for sharing your time with me.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300589" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300590" data-originallang="en">Deputy Minister, I appreciate your being here. I would encourage you, if you have a chance, to stick around afterwards to hear from some of the Palestinian Canadians in this room who, to your claim of other countries not being successful at having folks get out of Gaza, have, in my view, some pretty strong evidence that that's not the case. I'd encourage you to hear from them directly.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300591" data-originallang="en">I'd like to follow up on a mother of Maha and Saja from my community. I provided a letter to the minister about their case back on February 12, and again on February 27. She has a TRV already. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8300592" data-originallang="en">My question to the minister, and my question to you, is why is it that she's not been able to get out with a TRV already?</p>
