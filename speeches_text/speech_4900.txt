<p data-HoCid="8576653" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, we have talked about anti-Semitism. We have talked about the attacks on churches, mosques and gurdwaras. We say in the House that no matter when people came to this country, what language they speak or what colour their skin is, there is no room for this. There is no room for the hatred, and we want to ensure that Jews are part of the story and the denunciation of hate. So far we have seen none of that from the government or from anywhere else.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576654" data-originallang="en">Members do not have to ask me. I represent one of the largest Jewish constituencies, but I have become a voice for the many people in this country who email me every single day about being terrified of living in this country. It is happening because of the actions of the government and its coalition partner that are driving division in this country.</p>
