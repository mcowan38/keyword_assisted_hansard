<p data-HoCid="8703202" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703203" data-originallang="fr">I would like to thank our witnesses for joining us today and for once again shedding light on this important—though not necessarily straightforward—issue that we are currently studying.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703204" data-originallang="fr">I think I can safely say that everyone around this table believes in the two-state solution. It's because I believe in the two-state solution that I believe in recognizing the state of Palestine. By the same token, I recognize Israel's right to exist, and its right to exist in security.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703205" data-originallang="fr">Earlier, Mr. Fogel suggested that a congruent part of the Jewish community in Canada disagreed with the idea that Israel has the right to exist, and to exist in security.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703206" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Balsam, do you believe that Israel has the right to exist, to exist in security?</p>
