<p data-HoCid="8823531" data-originallang="en"> I just want to circle back. I have two quick questions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8823532" data-originallang="en">The first one circles back to the anti-Semitic chants that we heard in the streets in Montreal, in Toronto and in other places as well—for example, “From Palestine to Lebanon, Israel will soon be gone” and “There's only one solution: intifada, revolution”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8823533" data-originallang="en">Do you specifically condemn these chants?</p>
