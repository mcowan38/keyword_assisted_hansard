<p data-HoCid="8539675" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Chair</p>
<p data-HoCid="8539676" data-originallang="en"> I thank you for correcting the record earlier when Mr. Brock was claiming that we had called the witness, that we were wasting time and that we were having these meetings that are wasting members' time. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8539677" data-originallang="en">Thank you for correcting the record because as a member of Parliament and as someone who takes this committee very seriously, to see it being used time and time again to push the Conservative narrative—a false narrative and a narrative that is going down rabbit holes, witch hunts and God knows what else is going on—and not allowing the duly appointed independent officers of Parliament to do the jobs they have to do.... </p>
<p data-HoCid="8539678" data-originallang="en">If it was the case that those officers of Parliament—I'm very glad to see the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner here—were not doing their jobs, then indeed parliamentarians would be called into action. However, when they are doing their jobs—the RCMP, the Auditor General or anyone else who is doing their investigation—we must let them do their work.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8539679" data-originallang="en">I want to read now, for the record, from the letter from the commissioner of the RCMP. This is the letter we were sent on July 25. It's a letter that is directed to the law clerk, Michel Bédard. It says:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8539680" data-originallang="en"> The RCMP has also reviewed the implications of the Motion— </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8539681" data-originallang="en">This is the motion of June 6.</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8539682" data-originallang="en"> —in a potential criminal investigation. Before taking any investigative steps to access documents that may give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy, the RCMP must comply with applicable legal standards to preserve the viability of any potential criminal investigation or prosecution. The Parliamentary production order does not set aside these legal requirements. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8539683" data-originallang="en">I'll repeat, “The Parliamentary production order does not set aside these legal requirements.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8539684" data-originallang="en">It continues:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8539685" data-originallang="en"> For the reasons set out above, the RCMP's ability to receive and use information obtained through this production order and under the compulsory powers afforded by the Auditor General Act in the course of a criminal investigation could give rise to concerns under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It is therefore highly unlikely that any information obtained by the RCMP under the Motion where privacy interests exists could be used to support a criminal prosecution or further a criminal investigation. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8539686" data-originallang="en"> How much time do I have, Chair?</p>
