<p data-HoCid="8312667" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Bloc Québécois, I want to offer our condolences to the family and friends of Jacob Flickinger, who died on April 1 in Gaza.<sup></sup></p>
<p data-HoCid="8312668" data-originallang="fr">An aid worker for the World Central Kitchen, Mr. Flickinger grew up in Saint‑Georges, in Beauce, before moving to Stoneham and heading to the United States, where he lived with his wife and their one-year old baby. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8312669" data-originallang="fr">He went to Gaza to help. Like thousands of aid workers, he risked his own life to go to Gaza to spread a bit of hope in a territory that has been devastated since the beginning of the conflict with Israel. In war time, often when the worst atrocities are committed, we must remember those who are ready to sacrifice their lives in the name of humanity and fraternity.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8312670" data-originallang="fr">I thank Mr. Flickinger for his self-sacrifice and his generosity. May world leaders learn from his courage and his conviction and finally find a solution to this unending and intolerable conflict. </p>
