Theodor Herzl, the father of modern-day Zionism, said, “If you will it, it is no dream.” In 1948, that dream became a reality and the Jewish people had a state in their ancestral homeland.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Today, we celebrate with them Yom Ha'atzmaut, Israel's Independence Day. Canada is proud to have been one of the first countries to formally recognize Israel in 1948. Our two countries have shared 75 years as friends, allies and close partners. We will continue to oppose efforts to isolate Israel in international forums and we will continue to stand against any attacks on the values we share. We are united by shared bonds and values that will forever endure.</p>
