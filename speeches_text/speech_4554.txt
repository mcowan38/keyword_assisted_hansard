<p data-HoCid="8479616" data-originallang="en"> Yes, you are correct in your assessment. Even the word “Islamophobia” is hard to define and is much harder to define than “anti-Semitism”. People are confused and wonder if not liking Islam as a theology makes one an Islamophobe. That's not true. The word is difficult to define. I think it would be clearer if we used the words “anti-Muslim hatred” when it's a more appropriate term to use.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479617" data-originallang="en"> The maintenance of the status quo internationally has a role in Islamophobia here at home. It's done on purpose to make Muslim Canadians into an outside entity or a fifth column. That type of Islamophobia does not have an overlap with anti-Semitism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479618" data-originallang="en"> As to the people who fall into the great replacement theory in white nationalism, there's a strong overlap there in the root causes and explanations. In fact, the great replacement theory says that it's a Jewish conspiracy to have Muslim, Black or other minorities come to North America to replace the voting bloc. That's ludicrous, but that's what they believe.</p>
