<p data-HoCid="8027903" data-originallang="en"> If I may bring the member's attention to the facts and correct the record, CBC first reported on the terrifically horrific attack or bomb on the hospital in the Gaza Strip based on an Associated Press report, which is a trusted source of news for us. You'll notice, if you go to CBC.ca or Radio-Canada.ca, that we often use news feeds from other trusted, reputable news organizations, and we cited the source of that information, as Ms. Lantsman has just pointed out. Ninety minutes later, when we received the corrected information, we updated the site. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8027904" data-originallang="en">I would just like to say that we stand behind our journalism. In conflicts and in war, news comes at a very fast rate and people are claiming on both sides of the story. Our journalists on the ground and in our newsrooms are obliged to measure and take account.</p>
