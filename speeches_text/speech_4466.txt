<p data-HoCid="8428496" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, for decades, Canada's position has been very clear, and it continues to be very clear. The only solution for peace in the Middle East is to have a secure and recognized Palestinian state alongside a secure and recognized Israeli state. This is the only way.</p>

Today, we have taken an important step by acknowledging that it is not necessarily at the end of this process that we will recognize the Palestinian state.</p>
