<p data-HoCid="8693846" data-originallang="en">Just to put my bias out on the table, for me, hope is perhaps the most important factor and most powerful tool to end terrorism and to end militancy. For me, a two-state solution provides hope. For me, it is necessary to have two states to have a two-state solution. If we want to end this conflict, to me, hope is absolutely critical.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693847" data-originallang="en">I also wanted to say that I don't believe there are two sides, as has been said in this meeting; I think there are many sides. I want to raise that we have governments, but we also have people and civil society organizations and many people who are working for solutions that are important to get to peace.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693848" data-originallang="en">My question is related to the fact that we are not talking about the world's recognition of the State of Palestine; we're talking about Canada's recognition. We're a country that has some influence, but not a lot. Can you tell me why you think Canada's recognition of the State of Palestine could be helpful in the pursuit of peace? I don't mean generic recognition, but Canada's. </p>
