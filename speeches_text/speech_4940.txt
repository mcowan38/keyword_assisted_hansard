<p data-HoCid="8564981" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, Canadians are appalled by the Liberals' failure to help family members in Gaza get to safety and reunite with their loved ones here in Canada. From the beginning, the government's initiative was marred in red tape and roadblocks. Precious time was wasted and loved ones continue to be killed. Israel's brutal siege and bombardment continue and there is further escalation in the region. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8564982" data-originallang="en">What concrete action has the government taken to ramp up diplomatic efforts and collaborate with NGOs on the ground to help bring loved ones to safety? </p>
