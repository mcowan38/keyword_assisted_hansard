<p data-HoCid="8564808" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, on September 30, we mark the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation. Together, we honour the survivors of residential schools and mourn the thousands of children who never returned home. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8564809" data-originallang="en">We have a legal and moral obligation to address the ongoing harms to first nations, Inuit and MÃ©tis peoples; to acknowledge what happened in residential schools as genocide; and to facilitate a path for healing. The government must do more. One important step would be to pass the bill from the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>, which would combat residential school denialism. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8564810" data-originallang="en">This year, in my riding, constituents will be participating in the annual Reconciliation Day Ride, hosted by Victoria Orange Shirt Day and Capital Bike. We will hear from incredible leaders in our community, such as Diane Sam from the Songhees Nation, as well as Eddy Charlie, a residential school survivor from Cowichan Tribes. We will then ride as a group to the South Island Powwow.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8564811" data-originallang="en"> This year's grand entry will take place at noon and at 6 p.m. Everyone is invited to come celebrate indigenous cultures and resiliency. <em>Hay'sxw'qa si'em.</em></p>
