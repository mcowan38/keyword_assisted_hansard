<p data-HoCid="8173061" data-originallang="en">Is there any debate on the amendment referenced, NDP-2? </p>
<p data-HoCid="8173062" data-originallang="en">Oh, I'm sorry; before we get to debate, again it's my responsibility as chair to follow the procedure adopted by the House, which requires me to rule on the admissibility of amendments.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8173063" data-originallang="en">Again, Bill <a data-HoCid="12260777" href="/bills/44-1/C-318/" title="An Act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and the Canada Labour Code (adoptive and intended parents)">C-318</a>, as it was presented to the committee and debated by the committee, introduces a new type of special benefit, an attachment benefit of 15 weeks for adoptive parents and parents of children conceived through surrogacy. This amendment attempts to create another benefit, whereby an indigenous child could be placed with a self-employed person different from the child's parents, following processes that are different from the provincial adoption process indicated in the bill. The claimant could be entitled to obtain a 15-week benefit drawn from the treasury.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8173064" data-originallang="en">As <em>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</em>, third edition, states on page 772, “Since an amendment may not infringe upon the financial initiative of the Crown, it is inadmissible if it imposes a charge on the public treasury, or if it extends the objects or purposes or relaxes the conditions and qualifications specified in the royal recommendation.” </p>
<p data-HoCid="8173065" data-originallang="en">In the opinion of the chair, the amendment proposes a new scheme that imposes a new charge on the public treasury, and therefore it would require a royal recommendation. Therefore, I rule the amendment inadmissible. My ruling is not subject to debate but can be challenged.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8173066" data-originallang="en">Go ahead, Ms. Gazan.</p>
