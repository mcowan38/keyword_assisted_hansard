<p data-HoCid="8284444" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, I can address this. I had the pleasure of accompanying <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">Minister Joly</a> on her trip to the Middle East and I was part of those meetings. I can say that this was actually addressed at quite some length in a round table with women's rights advocates, particularly experts on sexual and gender-based violence, with the First Lady of Israel and then in a follow-up conversation with President Herzog of Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8284445" data-originallang="en">On your first question, allegations have been made. You're right about the atrocities on October 7, which were clearly committed by Hamas. There is a lot of evidence that points towards the sexual crimes that were committed, so the $1 million that has been set aside to help Israeli women survivors is support for recovery, counselling, etc., and that is clearly identified. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8284446" data-originallang="en">There have also been allegations made of sexual and/or gender-based violence towards Palestinian women, not with as direct an attribution. The position of the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">minister</a> on this is that when a woman comes forward and makes such allegations, we should believe the woman, first and foremost, and always investigate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8284447" data-originallang="en">The money in the second announcement was to support these women, but of course allegations will need to be pursued and investigations will need to be made. </p>
