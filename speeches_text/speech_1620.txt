<p data-HoCid="7125362" data-originallang="en">I want to also say that I was so moved in terms of what Mr. Farber said about being a descendant of a Holocaust survivor and not having any family on his father's side. It reminds me that this week—tonight—is the beginning of Yom HaShoah, when we remember all the six million Jews who were victims in the Holocaust, murdered by the Nazis. How appropriate it is that we're having this discussion in the Canadian Parliament on the very anniversary of that date. This week as well, B'nai Brith's audit showed that even though Jews make up about 1.25% of the Canadian population, Jews are the victims of 61% of religious hate crimes in Canada. There's something weird, and awesomely bad, about that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7125363" data-originallang="en">Mr. Panneton, I want to ask a question about social media. When it comes to social media, we see that wherever it goes, whether it was right before the insurrection last year, QAnon, George Soros, or whatever else seems to be happening, Jews are always at the centre of the narrative. We see that with the Russians right now and the disinformation campaign about Ukraine. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7125364" data-originallang="en">Can you explain to me why historically all of these groups for some reason seem to want to go after Jews as part of their disinformation campaigns?</p>
