<p data-HoCid="8726831" data-originallang="en">To my colleague from <a data-HoCid="310385" href="/politicians/don-stewart/" title="Don Stewart">Toronto—St. Paul's</a>, it is so spectacular to have a Conservative in that seat within the GTA, representing those views. I have been so fortunate in the couple of months we have been able to work together to learn from the member and to learn some of the unique challenges that people in Toronto are facing that we had not heard because no one on the Liberal benches brings those concerns forward as it is not politically salient to them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8726832" data-originallang="en">The member raises some very serious concerns regarding the Jewish community and the sense of safety and the lack of safety. It is not just the sense. People do not feel safe, but they no longer are safe. I want to thank the member for his amazing advocacy for the people of Toronto—St. Paul's and I look forward to adding more members from the GTA, with his help, in the next election, whenever that happens to be.</p>
