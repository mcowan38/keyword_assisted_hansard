<p data-HoCid="8207478" data-originallang="en">It's not just our subsurface system. Under the surface, we connect across provinces and territories and across national and international boundaries. The work that's being done in Israel is something that I saw. One of the witnesses mentioned the drip irrigation systems, and I saw those used extensively in Israel. I know that we're using them in the wine industry and in apple orchards.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8207479" data-originallang="en">Is it fair to say that groundwater has the potential to do some of what surface water is doing currently, if surface water was to go away?</p>
