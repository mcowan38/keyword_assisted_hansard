<p data-HoCid="8682513" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, it will be a real joy to see all our Olympians, of whom we are so proud.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8682514" data-originallang="en">I will get back to the green slush fund scandal, which began with Navdeep Bains, who was then the minister of industry, science and economic development. He was involved in some questionable things. I want to read from one of the newspapers about the time when he stepped down:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8682515" data-originallang="en"> ...Bains was implicated in a questionable real estate transaction, when former Brampton mayor Linda Jeffrey's chief of staff [Mr.] Punia, shared confidential details about a land purchase with Bains and former Liberal MP Raj Grewal. When Brampton council learned about the behaviour it sent details of a third-party investigation into the matter to the RCMP, because the force was already looking into Grewal's activities involving chronic gambling in Ottawa while he served as an MP. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8682516" data-originallang="en"> The City eventually paid about $1 million extra for the land it was trying to acquire, after a group of local businessmen with ties to the Liberals purchased it, then flipped it to the City, after Punia had passed on details of the original offer the City had planned to make for the property, which was owned by the Province. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8682517" data-originallang="en"> There is no evidence Bains has any ties to the [business].... </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8682518" data-originallang="en">Just because we could not find evidence does not mean that nothing happened. The article continues:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8682519" data-originallang="en"> Grewal was charged in September by the RCMP with five counts of fraud and breach of trust for alleged misuse of his constituency office budget while he was an MP, after an extensive investigation. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8682520" data-originallang="en">This was the kind of people who started the fund and then went forward with it. It then got a bit worse, because in 2019, the current <a data-HoCid="278910" href="/politicians/steven-guilbeault/" title="Steven Guilbeault">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</a> came along. He was one of the people who approved the money for the fund in 2021. He was a member of cabinet, which approved the billion dollars going into the slush fund.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8682521" data-originallang="en"> I have one other thing to say about Navdeep Bains. The article reads:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8682522" data-originallang="en"> Bains was in the news again when questions were raised last year about his father's involvement with individuals implicated in a Fort Erie Gurdwara scandal. There is no evidence Bains has any ties with the plan and he denies any link.... The Sikh temple had sponsored three priests from India who were given special visas by Ottawa. It turned out the Gurdwara was not even operating and the three men disappeared after arriving in Canada. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8682523" data-originallang="en">We do not have any evidence of wrongdoing, but there is always suspicion. Here we are again with the same thing because the <a data-HoCid="278910" href="/politicians/steven-guilbeault/" title="Steven Guilbeault">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</a> was part of the cabinet that approved the billion dollars. One of the board members was a lady named Andrée-Lise Méthot. She was the founder and managing partner of Cycle Capital, a company that the Minister of Environment and Climate Change is invested in.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8682524" data-originallang="en">Section 119 of the Criminal Code says that no holder of public office, for example someone like the <a data-HoCid="278910" href="/politicians/steven-guilbeault/" title="Steven Guilbeault">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</a>, can take an action, for example giving a billion dollars to a slush fund that would be of benefit for themselves, for example his investment in Cycle Capital, which tripled its value through the money given to it from the green slush fund.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8682525" data-originallang="en"> I certainly think that when the RCMP finishes its investigation and is able to see the documents, it could be that the <a data-HoCid="278910" href="/politicians/steven-guilbeault/" title="Steven Guilbeault">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</a> will be back in his orange pajamas again. He, as we know, was a convicted felon. In 2001 he was charged and convicted. He served a year's probation plus 100 hours of community service and paid $1,000 of restitution.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8682526" data-originallang="en">This is the calibre of corruption in the Liberal government and cabinet. It is no wonder things go awry when these kinds of people are involved. The Liberals have been trying to suggest that they need to stand up for the charter rights of Canadians. I certainly wish they would, because they have not.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8682527" data-originallang="en">One is what their record says they are, and if we look at the record of the Liberal government on the matter, we see the chill the Liberals have put on freedom of speech in this country with Bill <a data-HoCid="11528728" href="/bills/44-1/C-11/" title="An Act to amend the Broadcasting Act and to make related and consequential amendments to other Acts">C-11</a>, the censorship bill. With Bill <a data-HoCid="11668222" href="/bills/44-1/C-18/" title="An Act respecting online communications platforms that make news content available to persons in Canada">C-18</a>, the freedom of the press was compromised. Bill <a data-HoCid="12913297" href="/bills/44-1/C-63/" title="An Act to enact the Online Harms Act, to amend the Criminal Code, the Canadian Human Rights Act and An Act respecting the mandatory reporting of Internet child pornography by persons who provide an Internet service and to make consequential and related amendments to other Acts">C-63</a>, the online harms bill that I just talked about, once again would violate everyone's charter rights happily.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8682528" data-originallang="en">Then there is freedom of religion. I spoke about this before, but since then, things have escalated even further in our country. Have members heard about the persecution that Hindus are facing in Brampton? People were out with knives. There were violent attacks on temples. The government has done nothing about it. Liberals wring their pearls and say that it is unacceptable, but they have done nothing to ensure that the rule of law in this country is enforced.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8682529" data-originallang="en"> What is the point of having rules to protect Canadians if they are not enforced, and why has the federal government, which has the highest authority to make sure that rights are protected, done nothing? A hundred or more Christian churches were burned in our country, and again, it is crickets from the Liberals on this. It goes on and on. What has happened to Jewish Canadians is heartbreaking. They have been constantly harassed, and their synagogues and their businesses are vandalized. They have been given death treats and nothing has been done. Certainly freedom of religion in this country is in serious jeopardy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8682530" data-originallang="en">Furthermore, there is discrimination that happens. We are supposed to be free from discrimination in this country, but it happens even in the Liberal benches. The Liberals are discriminating based on age. They decided to give seniors who are older than 75 more money than the seniors who are between 65 and 75. Similarly, there are violations in the minority language rights; the government has been proven several times in court to not have done what it should have done to protect the minority language rights of Canadians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8682531" data-originallang="en">Let me sidebar for a moment and say how proud I am to announce that Sarnia—Lambton has the official francophone designation of Ontario.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8682532" data-originallang="fr">I am very happy. I worked hard with the francophones of Sarnia—Lambton and I am very proud of our work.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8682533" data-originallang="en">The other argument we will hear from the Liberal benches is that the RCMP does not want the documents. Is it really the case that the RCMP does not want to see evidence of potential crime? The whistle-blower was clear that there was criminality going on, and it is possible that it was with more than one minister. I talked about the <a data-HoCid="278910" href="/politicians/steven-guilbeault/" title="Steven Guilbeault">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</a>, but actually there is also the current <a data-HoCid="271243" href="/politicians/francois-philippe-champagne/" title="François-Philippe Champagne">minister</a> who was overseeing the Sustainable Development Technology Canada fund.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8682534" data-originallang="en">There is an agreement that says the board members had to disclose any conflicts of interest to ISED, so the minister would have known about them and not acted. Perhaps that is what would be uncovered when the documents are released. Certainly there is an issue there.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8682535" data-originallang="en">I think that what happened in the slush fund is just another example, and we keep racking up dollars. I think about the number of scandals that have happened in the government since I came here in 2015. This one is $400 million. There was the $372 million the Liberals gave to Frank Baylis to make ventilators when he had never made ventilators before, and they never ended up using any of them. It goes on and on with the different scandals. There was the WE Charity scandal and the huge waste of money there.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8682536" data-originallang="en">Canadians are finding the current scandal particularly obscene, at a time when the number of people going to food banks is the highest it has ever been. There are also 1,400 tent encampments in Ontario alone, and they are spread across the country. At a time when people are struggling, cannot afford food and cannot afford to feed their family and heat their house, there is an incredible waste of money and people lining the pockets of insiders. It is just unacceptable.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8682537" data-originallang="en">When I look at some of the previous things that have happened, I ask myself what we need to do to put in place some accountability so that this sort of thing does not happen. What kind of protection can we provide to whistle-blowers? If it is going on in one department, what is going on in all the other funds?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8682538" data-originallang="en"> It is said that the fish rots from the head. The <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> has already been violating ethics laws in the billionaire island fiasco, and he is also under suspicion in the SNC-Lavalin scandal for pressuring a criminal prosecution, which the RCMP is investigating. In the WE Charity scandal, the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> took an action, by awarding money to the organization, that benefited himself and his family: his brother, his mother and his wife. As I said before, under subsection 119(1) of the Criminal Code, that is illegal. It is not just a mistake.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8682539" data-originallang="en"> Therefore we really have to clean up the government, and it does not look to me like we can change the spots on the leopards. Over here on the Conservative benches, we believe in the rule of law. We believe in transparency. We believe in accountability and we believe in trying to be prudent with the use of taxpayer dollars for the benefit of all Canadians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8682540" data-originallang="en"> I think that Canadians are looking for a change. They cannot take the continual rise in taxes that they have seen under the current government, such as the carbon tax, which it is going to increase to 61¢ a litre at a time when people are already struggling. The Liberals want to quadruple it and quadruple the misery.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8682541" data-originallang="en">EI premiums, CPP premiums and all of these things are going in the wrong direction at a time when there is going to be increasing competitiveness from the U.S.; President-elect Trump has clearly put America as a priority, and we are not on competitive ground. We have taxes and a regulatory burden that are going to drive millions of dollars and millions of jobs to the U.S.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8682542" data-originallang="en"> The Sustainable Development Technology Canada fund is the tip of the iceberg. We have to get to the bottom of it. As much as everybody would like to move on from this, until the documents are produced unredacted and we can give them to the RCMP so we can get to the bottom of what happened, the Conservatives are going to continue to do what is our job. We are His Majesty's loyal opposition, and our job is to hold the government to account, which means not just saying, “Oh, there's nothing to see here.” It means asking for the documents, doing the hard work to get to the bottom of it and going to committees.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8682543" data-originallang="en"> I understand that once the documents are produced, the PROC committee is supposed to look at them. However, I have a little bit of skepticism about that, because with every other scandal that has gone to any committee, NDP members, partners of the Liberals, work together with them. They are still doing it, even though the <a data-HoCid="278714" href="/politicians/jagmeet-singh/" title="Jagmeet Singh">leader of the NDP</a> made a big deal of ripping up the agreement, effectively saying, “Oh, the Liberals are too weak and they can't be trusted. We're not going work with them anymore.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8682544" data-originallang="en">The New Democrats are still supporting the Liberals today at committee. What they do is shut down the committee. They filibuster so they do not have to produce the documents, and that is exactly what would happen if this thing went to committee, which is why we have to hold on and wait until the Liberals deliver the documents.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8682545" data-originallang="en">Why will they not deliver the documents? The Auditor General has seen them, although she was not auditing criminality. The documents exist and need to be produced, but what are they hiding? Are people going to go to jail? That is what it is starting to look like. However, we will not know until we see the documents, so the Liberals need to produce them, the sooner the better.</p>
