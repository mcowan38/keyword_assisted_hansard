<p data-HoCid="6403380" data-originallang="en">I don't disagree that Canada is and always should be an ally, but, to respectfully disagree with Ms. Dabrusin, the vast majority of Canadian Jews would not appreciate the fact that their government is voting for a resolution that refers to Israel, in the preamble, the way I described earlier. They simply would not. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6403381" data-originallang="en">In fact, although you say you have consulted and talked to many members of the Jewish community, I don't know if you have consulted with other people outside of the Jewish community who also feel very strongly about Canada's support for Israel. That might be a good thing to do as well. The reality is that three major organizations—B'nai B'rith, Simon Wiesenthal Center, CIJA—pleaded with you not to vote for this resolution, for the reasons they very clearly and concisely described.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6403382" data-originallang="en">If it is the position of the Government of Canada that there should be two states living peacefully side by side, that is a point you can make without voting for a resolution that calls Israel an occupier, supports contiguity of Palestinian regions, and calls the wall an impediment to self-determination. You didn't have to do that to make your point.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6403383" data-originallang="en">That's not a question. It's just a statement. It's really to set the record straight on how Canadian Jews and millions of other Canadians who support Israel feel about what your government did this year and last year.</p>
