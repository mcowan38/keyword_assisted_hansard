<p data-HoCid="8679389" data-originallang="en">Professor Imseis, I'm going to ask you a series of three questions, if I can get through them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679390" data-originallang="en"> In late September, Jordan's foreign affairs minister, Ayman Safadi, said at the UN that Arab countries are “willing to guarantee the security of Israel” if Israel ends its occupation and a Palestinian state is established.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679391" data-originallang="en">Can you comment on the role of Muslim and Arab countries in potentially supporting the security of Israel once the occupation ends and a Palestinian state is recognized? </p>
