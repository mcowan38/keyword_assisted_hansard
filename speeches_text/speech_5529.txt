<p data-HoCid="8703340" data-originallang="en"> Israel has made it clear that it has no intention of respecting the ICJ ruling. Israel has made it clear that it has no intention of respecting international law. Israel is now planning to take over northern Gaza and re-establish settlements in northern Gaza. Since July, Israel has, as I mentioned earlier, seized the largest amount of land.... I think what we are seeing right now is the absence of the international community holding Israel accountable for these actions.</p>
