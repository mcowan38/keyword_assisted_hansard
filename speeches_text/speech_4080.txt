<p data-HoCid="8396573" data-originallang="en"> I am deeply concerned about the humanitarian situations in Gaza and in Afghanistan, as I've said many times. Both of these territories are controlled by recognized terrorist organizations. Canadian organizations cannot operate in these places without authorization. That was the problem that Bill <a data-HoCid="12265330" href="/bills/44-1/C-41/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code and to make consequential amendments to other Acts">C-41</a> was supposed to solve. It was supposed to provide a framework whereby organizations could provide support in terrorist-controlled areas. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8396574" data-originallang="en">We heard last spring, when we studied this bill at the justice committee, about the great urgency of the matter to avoid another winter. That was in the case of Afghanistan. Minister, it's been a full year. No organization has been given authorization, because there's been no framework whatsoever for giving them authorization. In my view, given the urgency of this and that we were told a year ago what the urgency was, this is utterly disgraceful, and this affects many of the humanitarian contexts we're talking about. Is this an issue of government incompetence that we've delayed a year, or is it simply a matter of you or your officials not actually believing in the framework of the bill in the first place?</p>
