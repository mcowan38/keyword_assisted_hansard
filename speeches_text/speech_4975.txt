<p data-HoCid="8594877" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, today, October 7, marks the end of a year of horror. It has been a year since Hamas terrorists massacred over 1,200 people in Israel. It has been a year since Hamas took nearly 250 people hostage, including dozens who are presumed to be alive but who are still missing. It has been a year since the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8594878" data-originallang="fr">Last October 7, Hamas committed acts of incredible barbarity that plunged the Middle East into a spiral of violence with no end in sight. The world has every right to deplore this spiral of violence, but we must not forget the October 7 victims, the innocent men, women and children. We must not forget the hostages and their families, who no longer know rest.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8594879" data-originallang="fr">On behalf of the Bloc Québécois, I want to reiterate my solidarity with the entire Jewish community, who deserve to be able to commemorate this tragedy safely and with dignity.</p>
