<p data-HoCid="8679346" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679347" data-originallang="en">My questions are for Professor Momani. Thank you for taking the time to appear in front of us, from the University of Waterloo. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679348" data-originallang="en">I was really interested in your opening remarks about the demographic reality. It seems to us that the path to a two-state solution—politically, not legally—must be the result of a negotiated two-state solution settlement between Israelis and Palestinians, and that it also must have popular support. I'm very interested in exploring the demographic reality of Palestinians and Israelis today. You mentioned that there are some 9.8 million Israelis: 40% of them are secular, about half a million of them are in the West Bank and approximately two million of them are Israeli Arabs or Palestinians. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679349" data-originallang="en">What is the level of popular support amongst the 9.8 million Israeli citizens? Can you break that down amongst the different constituent groups of Israeli citizens? Then I'd like to explore the Palestinian side.</p>
