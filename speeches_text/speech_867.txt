<p data-HoCid="6692118" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Minister. I want to ask one more follow-up question before we run out of time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6692119" data-originallang="en">IMPACT-se, the Institute for Monitoring Peace and Cultural Tolerance in school education, published a review this February of UNRWA-generated material in use after November. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6692120" data-originallang="en">This is UNRWA-generated material. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6692121" data-originallang="en">The report identifies many examples of continuing violent and hateful content. I want to read you one sample from that curriculum. This is grade 9 spelling material. Students were asked to copy this out and then check for spelling errors:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="6692122" data-originallang="en"> Our Enemies dare to defy us, because of our weakness and disunity. They are killing our sons, our old and our children, and make examples of them. Does that mean our sons responded with silence?! Our sons have risen up in revolt on our Enemies, resisting them courageously, in a resistance which embarrasses our Enemies and threatens their existence. However, our Arab relatives have sadly recognized our Enemies and began interacting with them, which weakened our sons' resoluteness, and prolonged the life of Occupation on our land. But a day will come, when this land will return to us and to our sons, and our Enemies will be banished, God willing, as failing losers. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="6692123" data-originallang="en">This is a contemporary example, after the errors were allegedly corrected, from an UNRWA-produced spelling textbook, which contains denunciation of peace, in particular of the Abraham accords, and an implied call for the banishment of Jews from Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6692124" data-originallang="en">I understand that you might not have read all of the curricular materials that were in use after that deadline, but what is your response to IMPACT-se's February report that outlines these key examples, and do you have continuing concerns about content like the content I just read out?</p>
