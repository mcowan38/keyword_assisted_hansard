<p data-HoCid="8083783" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, speaking of Bill <a data-HoCid="11884157" href="/bills/44-1/C-295/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (neglect of vulnerable adults)">C-295</a>, I assume I am not the only one here today to be overcome by sad memories of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8083784" data-originallang="fr">My thoughts go out to everyone who lost friends and family during the pandemic, one of the most difficult times we ever experienced as a society. There were 14,000 deaths in Quebec. It would be an understatement to say that the pandemic has had a lasting impact.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8083785" data-originallang="fr">On that note, I will now address Bill C-295 in greater detail and share what the Bloc Québécois thinks of it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8083786" data-originallang="fr">The Liberal Party of Canada is suffering from a worrying bout of amnesia, since, in March 2021, the NDP moved a motion to nationalize and impose standards on long-term care facilities. All of the other parties voted against the motion. Why then are the Liberals introducing this bill today? Have they forgotten that that is an NDP position and not a Liberal one? Who knows? I must say, since the emergence of the NDP-Liberal government, the two parties seem to share some of the same positions. At least the bill introduced today is slightly different from the motion moved by the NDP in March 2021.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8083787" data-originallang="fr">The Bloc Québécois proposed two amendments to Bill C-295 that were accepted. The first aimed to replace the concept of manager with that of officer. In an earlier version of the bill, the concept of manager was far too broad. As my colleague from <a data-HoCid="278737" href="/politicians/andreanne-larouche/" title="Andréanne Larouche">Shefford</a> so eloquently put it, if the concept of manager had been retained, the bill could have applied to a public servant responsible for procurement or to a nurse team leader. This is absurd, considering that the bill seeks to amend the Criminal Code to make it an offence for long-term care facilities, their owners and their officers to fail to provide the necessaries of life to the residents of facilities. The concept of officer is well established, since, in the bill, it applies to directors and senior administrators, including the president, vice-president, and so on. In short, the amendment puts the responsibility squarely on the people who run the homes, and not the workers who are already doing all the work.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8083788" data-originallang="fr">The second amendment proposed by the Bloc Québécois requires judges to take the laws of Quebec and the provinces into account. It seems to me that members here in the House of Commons often need to be reminded that health care falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of Quebec and the other provinces. While successive Liberal and Conservative governments have repeatedly tried to interfere in this provincial jurisdiction, nothing will magically change that fact.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8083789" data-originallang="fr">Several provinces, including Quebec, already have legislation in place to tackle elder abuse and require care facilities to have policies and processes for handling complaints. It is therefore important that judges take these laws into account before imposing any prohibition orders.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8083790" data-originallang="fr">Lucien Bouchard, one of the founders of the Bloc Québécois, said the following:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8083791" data-originallang="fr"> The government has neither the intent nor the mandate to abandon any part of Québec's constitutional jurisdictions... </p>
<p data-HoCid="8083792" data-originallang="fr"> Successive governments in Québec, regardless of their political option [as to the status of Quebec], have always worked to reaffirm its jurisdiction in order to foster its people's [Quebeckers'] control over its economic, social and cultural development.... </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8083793" data-originallang="fr">This quotation is timeless, as enduring as Canada's resolve to make decisions for Quebec.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8083794" data-originallang="fr">I campaigned for the “yes” side during the referendums of 1980 and 1995. I distinctly remember the federalists' fear campaign. They still make similar arguments today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8083795" data-originallang="fr">When Quebec stands up to Canada and stands up for its interests, threats to freeze funding that Quebec is entitled to usually follow. It is funny. Ottawa pulls out this argument as though it were pulling a rabbit out of a hat. Just two weeks ago, here in the House, Ottawa threatened Quebec with lower health transfers if we refused to exchange our francophone workers for unilingual anglophone doctors.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8083796" data-originallang="fr">During the pandemic, in May 2020, the negotiations between the Premier of Quebec, François Legault, and the federal government were particularly tense, including about the need to call in the army to help with the long-term care facilities. In his Speech from the Throne, the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> of Canada used Quebec's need for military assistance to announce his intention to impose Canadian standards in long-term care facilities. It was also a Liberal campaign promise in 2021. The Liberals promised a hefty $6 billion for long-term care facilities provided their standards were imposed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8083797" data-originallang="fr">This bill raises a question. If the federal government is now going to be interfering in Quebec's long-term care facilities and private seniors' residences, will the government threaten to freeze or reduce Quebec's health transfers? That is an issue that needs to be considered. Do we also need to reiterate that, in December 2020, the Quebec National Assembly unanimously adopted a motion denouncing the implementation of pan-Canadians standards for long-term care and demanding an increase in health transfers?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8083798" data-originallang="fr">This paternalism must stop. Not only does Quebec already have standards to prevent neglect and abuse, but it also has solutions on how it can improve in this area. Earlier, my colleague from <a data-HoCid="278737" href="/politicians/andreanne-larouche/" title="Andréanne Larouche">Shefford</a> listed a set of standards that Quebec is implementing to try to ensure that what happened during the pandemic never happens again. We are talking here about prevention, rather than criminalization, in order to protect the most vulnerable members of our society. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8083799" data-originallang="fr">In closing, the Bloc Québécois will vote in favour of Bill <a data-HoCid="11884157" href="/bills/44-1/C-295/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (neglect of vulnerable adults)">C‑295</a>, so that it can be improved in committee. We need to ensure that, with this bill, we are actually helping the provinces and Quebec to protect their seniors, rather than just quickly adding criminal offences to the Criminal Code without thinking about the long-term consequences.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8083800" data-originallang="fr">I will end my speech on a more personal note. My mother lived in a long-term care facility from January 2020 to November 2020 and passed away there. She did not die from COVID‑19 necessarily, but she did experience it. She received remarkable care. When talking about this bill, I want members to keep in mind that there are people in our health care system who do an amazing job. It is not the workers themselves who are targeted by this bill, but the officers.</p>
