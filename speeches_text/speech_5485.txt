<p data-HoCid="8714944" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714945" data-originallang="en"> You articulated, in your opening statement, Canada's position, going back to the 1940s and the creation of the State of Israel, and where Canada positioned itself throughout. I'm encouraged, actually, by the fact that this issue is very alive in all of our closest allies' capitals. I would assume that the decision on the timing of the recognition of the state is done—and you basically said that—in conjunction with our allies.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714946" data-originallang="en">Over time, has Canada's consideration of its weight—not directly within the State of Israel, but the political considerations—also taken into account the relationship with our closest allies?</p>
