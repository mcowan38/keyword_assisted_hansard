<p data-HoCid="8625077" data-originallang="fr">Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8625078" data-originallang="fr">When the NDP pushed hard for a bill on the child care system, <a data-HoCid="281025" href="/politicians/niki-ashton/" title="Niki Ashton">Niki Ashton</a> and <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Leah Gazan</a> really ensured that there would be provisions to support minority language child care, especially French‑language child care. However, one of the problems is the shortage of French‑speaking educators in the child care system.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8625079" data-originallang="fr">Is the federal government doing anything to address this labour shortage? I'm not just talking about day care centres, but also about teachers in the network of French‑language public schools in Ontario, for example. Is there a way for the federal government to ensure that enough people work in these networks? I understand the funding issue very well, but the labour shortage issue is also worrisome. Do you think the federal government has a role to play?</p>
