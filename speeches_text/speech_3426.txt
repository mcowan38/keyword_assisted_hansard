<p data-HoCid="8115974" data-originallang="en"> One of the most hostile places for Jews is on campus. Last week, a U.S. House committee heard from the presidents of Harvard, MIT and Penn State. All three were asked whether a call for the genocide of Jews would violate their code of conduct. None unambiguously said yes. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8115975" data-originallang="en">Today, some colleagues and I sent a letter to the 25 biggest Canadian universities asking how they are protecting their Jewish students. One thing we asked was whether a call for the genocide of Jews would violate their policies. I have also tabled a motion with the justice committee for us to undertake a study on anti-Semitism, with a focus on universities. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8115976" data-originallang="en">I hope colleagues will join me in wanting to tackle this issue quickly. The Jewish community cannot fight this alone. We need all MPs and Canadians on our side. </p>
