<p data-HoCid="7968722" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I rise with a heavy heart as the most horrific violence continues in the Middle East. We need an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages, investigation of war crimes by the ICC and ICJ, an arms embargo and the provision of humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7968723" data-originallang="en">I am also alarmed by the rise in anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian racism. Not only are people worried about the safety of family members in Palestine and Israel, they worry about their own safety as hate incidents multiply.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7968724" data-originallang="en">Let us be clear: Canadian Jews are not responsible for the actions of Netanyahu's government, and Palestinian, Arab and Muslim Canadians are not responsible for the actions of Hamas. Targeting people because of their faith or ethnic background is not activism; it is racism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7968725" data-originallang="en">People are hurting and afraid. We must come together and recognize each other's common humanity. We must speak up loudly together against rising hate.</p>
