<p data-HoCid="8012575" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8012576" data-originallang="en">Just a few minutes ago, I saw a headline saying “Liberal government set to miss 2030 emissions targets, says environment commissioner audit”. I found the article interesting. It reads:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8012577" data-originallang="en"> The audit said it had expected to find specific targets for how much each of the measures it implemented would cut emissions, but found there were no targets for 95 per cent of those measures. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8012578" data-originallang="en"> “Without expected emission reductions transparently available in the plan, it is not possible to know which of the mitigation measures to reduce emissions were key,” the audit said.... </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8012579" data-originallang="en">We are in a climate emergency. Every day we are seeing the change of our environment. This summer, I watched as many communities across my province of British Columbia were on fire. People were fleeing in circumstances I cannot even begin to imagine. In this province, we have seen communities destroyed by a river that literally fell out of the sky. This is happening, and the expenses of it are phenomenal.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8012580" data-originallang="en">Here we are today. We have an actual motion that would address some of these issues. It understands the seriousness of what is happening in our climate; it has gone beyond the pale, and we are in an existential crisis that we need to make right. We need that action.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8012581" data-originallang="en">We also know that, in this circumstance, we are seeing Canadians struggle with the cost of living. I talk to everyday Canadians across my region, who are trying so hard to keep up with costs. At the same time, Canada's biggest corporations, including the oil and gas sector, have record profits unlike anything they have seen for about 30 years. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8012582" data-originallang="en">We need to address the climate and what is happening; we also need to acknowledge that our society is becoming one that is simply, in my opinion, unfair. Everyday people are working so hard, but they are not getting ahead because the ultrawealthy are scooping up the excess and leaving ordinary Canadians behind.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8012583" data-originallang="en">This motion asks this place to remove the GST from all forms of home heating. This is something the NDP has been working on for a very long—</p>
