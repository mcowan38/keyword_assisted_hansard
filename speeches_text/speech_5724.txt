<p data-HoCid="8791993" data-originallang="en">First off, I'll say regarding the dispersal of funds among the councils, just shy of 80% of all new funds go for health research, natural sciences and engineeringâ€”to NSERC and CIHR. The vast majority goes there. I think a lot of it may be partnered outside of here, but it isn't research on something specific or not specific to Canada. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8791994" data-originallang="en">With regard to the value of research on issues around the globe, it's crucial for us both to be studying things that happen in Canada and things that happen around the globe. My own personal background in graduate research was studying the Middle East and nuclear non-proliferation related to Israel and Iran. Am I bringing it to bear on the work I'm doing now for universities? I'm not sure, but it's important for Canadians to be engaged in issues that are important around the world. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8791995" data-originallang="en">I think what's more interesting is that a lot research that has taken place in recent years on our history here in Canada has been on aspects of indigenous cultures, local regional cultures, etc., that we may not have understood unless we were engaged in it. </p>
