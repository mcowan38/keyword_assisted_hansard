<p data-HoCid="8559286" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour today to recognize Captain William H. Wilson, a man who has served his country and his community more in his 100 years than any of us could possibly dream of doing in 100 lifetimes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8559287" data-originallang="en">Captain Wilson served with the Royal Canadian Navy on the HMCS <em>Ottawa</em> on D-Day and was honoured with the Atlantic Star for his bravery. The Royal Canadian Navy named him the first honorary captain of Canada's first submarine squadron in honour of his tireless efforts to raise awareness of Canada's deep navy history. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8559288" data-originallang="en">Known as “The Rabbit”, he has this uncanny ability to find amazing artifacts for the Naval Museum in Calgary, a facility many believe would not even exist were it not for his tireless efforts. Whether it was during his time as the manager for the transportation of the 1988 Olympics, during his long career at CP Rail or when he was honoured with the Alberta Order of Excellence, his commitment to community is unparalleled. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8559289" data-originallang="en">I ask members to please join me in the House to wish Captain Bill a happy 100th birthday. Foothills thanks him for his service. </p>
