<p data-HoCid="6692533" data-originallang="en"> Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6692534" data-originallang="en">I'm going to propose an amendment, which I hope will break the logjam. We have had a series and a pattern. Normally we do this at a subcommittee, but the Conservative leadership on this committee didn't want a subcommittee to straighten this out and bring proposals back to the committee, which is the easier way of doing it. I'll leave that there. For whatever reasons, the Conservatives don't think those subcommittee meetings work. That's their prerogative, and I respect that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6692535" data-originallang="en">Here is my amendment. My motion is to amend Mr. Turnbull's motion so that the social finance study will be first; the NDP proposal on guaranteed basic income will be second, and the Conservative motion on seniors will be third, and that we split the remaining weeks between now and the end of the parliamentary session in June evenly among those three studies, starting at three meetings, three meetings and three meetings.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6692536" data-originallang="en">That way we all get a fair shot at this. I will remind everyone that we just finished a Bloc study, so we will commit at the end of that amendment that the Bloc, as they propose a study, would go into the fourth slot whenever we return.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6692537" data-originallang="en">The amendment would be that Mr. Turnbull's motion be amended to say that his study be for three weeks, that it be followed by a study on guaranteed basic income as presented by Madam Gazan for three weeks, that this be followed by a Conservative study on seniors for three weeks, and that the Bloc then be in a position to choose which study it prioritizes in the next space, out of fairness. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6692538" data-originallang="en">That is the amendment I propose for a proposed study. </p>
