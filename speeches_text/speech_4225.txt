<p data-HoCid="8460536" data-originallang="en"> That is unfortunate. As members are aware, witness invitations are up to the individual parties. This is not actually putting in anything new that we are not allowed to do otherwise. This is a little bit surprising. I would like to continue the process of studying this budget, and with some depth, hopefully, as the budget will affect millions of Canadians. In fact, nearly all Canadians will have some exposure to it. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8460537" data-originallang="en"> With that, I would like to talk a bit about the economy this budget will come into. I've noted before, at some length, that our economy is suffering. I'm glad to see that there is considerable conversation about it now. Certainly I wasn't the first to talk about productivity and our economy. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8460538" data-originallang="en">The reality is that our GDP per capita is the worst in the G7, and we continue to struggle with a productivity crisis here in Canada. I'm surprised we don't have more coverage or more discussion about the fact that we are experiencing in Canada a lost decade. For the last 10 years, GDP per capita has basically been flat, and that's extremely challenging. GDP per capita is basically the measure of economic output or the wealth or the prosperity of the average Canadian, and 10 years of zero growth is nearly unprecedented. It's the worst 10 years Canada has experienced since the Great Depression, actually.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8460539" data-originallang="en">We are actually in one of the longest recessions in Canadian history right now, if we measure GDP per capita per quarter. Canada's extensive population growth has masked that fact. Because its population is growing, the country is producing more, but on a per-person basis, a per capita basis, Canadians are actually getting poorer as every year goes by.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8460540" data-originallang="en"> I would like to bring to the committee's attention several commentators' thoughts on the economy. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8460541" data-originallang="en">I'll start with Vivek Dehejia. This is from an article he wrote on March 24, 2022. Although some time has elapsed, not much has changed. He wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8460542" data-originallang="en"> During last fall's election campaign, while the Bank of Canada's mandate was under review, the prime minister made the perplexing claim that he “doesn't think about monetary policy.” Even so, his re-elected government renewed the central bank's inflation target at the two per cent midpoint of a one to three per cent band. But the latest data tell us inflation is now running at 5.7 per cent. That's the highest we've seen it since the early 1990s, and it's rising. The problem it poses is real, pressing and getting worse. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8460543" data-originallang="en">What Vivek is talking about there is the fact that we were facing high inflation. Although inflation is now at 2.7%, it's often said by economists that the last mile of inflation is the hardest to get down. It gets very sticky when you get to or around the target range. The potentially very serious issue is that if the Bank of Canada brings down interest rates prematurely and gets the economy fired up again and the housing prices start to increase and other factors start to increase, it could create a false start. Inflation could really dig in, and the Bank of Canada would have to raise interest rates again, which would obviously be a rough outcome.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8460544" data-originallang="en">The last time a Trudeau was Prime Minister, this is exactly what happened. There was an initial false start, with inflation starting to come down and interest rates starting to come down, and then they had to be brought up again. This is what we want to avoid. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8460545" data-originallang="en">It's particularly dangerous because of the precarious nature of the Canadian mortgage market. There are a series of mortgages issued by some of our major banks that have variable interest rates but level payments. What that means is if you're paying $1,000 every two weeks or $2,000 a month, that payment stays the same. However, the interest rate that underpins the mortgage contracts continues to vary.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8460546" data-originallang="en"> This means you can actually get into a position where, because interest rates went up so quickly, you are paying less than the actual interest payment on your mortgage, which creates the effect of the principal actually increasing over time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8460547" data-originallang="en">Many mortgages in Canada are for five-year renewable terms. If we look back five years ago, we see some very low interest rates. When they renew at these higher rates, it could cause a tremendous shock. That would definitely be exacerbated by a further increase in interest rates. That's why Mr. Macklem is in a difficult position as to when and how quickly he lowers interest rates. If in fact inflation starts again, it could have very serious consequences for Canadians, particularly those in the mortgage industry. He's being very circumspect, and rightly so, about whether he will reduce interest rates.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8460548" data-originallang="en"> The odd comment isn't.... I'm quite frankly surprised that we haven't heard more from the media or otherwise from the Liberal Party. In a seemingly flip comment, the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> did say that he was “sure” that interest rates would go down. Even if he's right with that prediction, it's troubling that he would make it in such a guaranteed, confident way, because there's no way he could know that unless he was inappropriately directing the Bank of Canada. I'm certainly not making that allegation today, but it is very strange that he would make that commitment, that guarantee, that interest rates would go down when he would have no way of doing that except through ways that would be inappropriate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8460549" data-originallang="en"> I actually asked the Governor of the Bank of Canada, Tiff Macklem, about that, and he seemed bemused or confused by it as well. There's certainly no way, through appropriate channels, that a Prime Minister could in any way guarantee that interest rates would go down.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8460550" data-originallang="en">To go on, one of the things that Liberals have said is.... I'll continue with Vivek's article here. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8460551" data-originallang="en"> The government says inflation is a “global problem” and it's true that most advanced economies are also experiencing rising prices. But that's because they're following the same hyper-expansionary policies. Our own inflation is the creation of the Bank of Canada. The chart shows CPI inflation, as well as the growth of two definitions of the money supply (M1+ and M2++) over the last decade. Money growth was steady for much of the period but began creeping up in the middle of 2019 and has since grown explosively as the bank and the government have worked to prevent a severe economic downturn. Although their growth has tapered off, these aggregates are still growing at extraordinary rates. For example, M1+, which is currency held by the public and all chequable deposits at financial institutions, is still growing at a jaw-dropping 14 per cent. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8460552" data-originallang="en"> The reality is that if we perform an objective study with intellectual integrity and vigour, we'll find that the same policies yield more or less the same results. They are socialist policies. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8460553" data-originallang="en">We could, of course, point to obvious examples of these policies in the extreme, such as the Soviet Union and its horrendous record of death and destruction. Millions of Russians, Ukrainians and Poles, among many other ethnic groups, were sent to their deaths and to gulags under these socialist Soviet Union programs. We could point to that. We could point to Cuba or Venezuela, where the people have suffered tremendously. Those are the extremes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8460554" data-originallang="en"> I'd like to use three examples that are not quite as extreme in nature, although they certainly had devastating outcomes on their people.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8460555" data-originallang="en"> One would be Israel. We'll start with Israel. Shortly after World War II, they embraced many socialist collectivist policies and, of course, most notably, are known for the kibbutzim, the collective farms that Israel utilized, whereby produce would be gathered and utilized among the collective. It actually didn't have terrible results initially, but a series of economic crises hit, including hyperinflation. You'll see that this is the usual outcome of expansionary socialist money policies. You see economic growth slow down and inflation increase. That's exactly what happened in Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8460556" data-originallang="en">Eventually, it was turned around—in fact, through some of the interventions of Ronald Reagan in pushing Israel to a free market system. The result was that Israel, since the year 2000, has actually had one of the strongest economic records of all countries across the world. It's an amazing story of the difference between socialism and free market capitalism. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8460557" data-originallang="en">The second example I'd like to use is that of the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom similarly, but in a different variation, adopted many socialist policies shortly after World War II, including the nationalization of nearly every major industry. That led to, once again, extremely slow and painful economic growth and high rates of inflation. In fact, by the late seventies, it was referred to as the “sick man of Europe”. Then Margaret Thatcher came to power. Margaret Thatcher, of course, sold off many of the industries and embraced free market policies, and Great Britain tamed inflation and brought economic growth back to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8460558" data-originallang="en">The third example I'd like to give you is actually that of the world's largest democracy: India. Even before World War II, India embraced the idea of self-reliance after being put through some very difficult times through colonialism. India was determined to be self-reliant, which is a virtuous goal in itself, I think, but unfortunately that led to isolationism and a scorning of capitalism and free trade, which led India to very poor levels of economic performance and very high rates of inflation. Then India also switched to a more free market and free trade economy, which turned around their economy. We can all see that India's economy is currently taking off. Its record of growth is huge, which is tremendous, because it's that economic growth that will bring a country to prosperity. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8460559" data-originallang="en">We've seen the same playbook here in Canada. We saw some of the socialist policies of <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister Trudeau.</a> Initially, the results weren't that bad because they were living off the legacy of former prime minister Stephen Harper and his fiscal restraint and common-sense approach to taxation, regulation and natural resource exploration, but then you get to the point where these policies.... It's like death by a thousand cuts. Your lack of focus on productivity and economic growth and your over-regulation and overtaxation slowly suffocate economic growth, and where are we?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8460560" data-originallang="en"> Well, we are now in the period of a lost decade. Our GDP per capita is among the very slowest and lowest in the G7. Our inflation continues to be painfully high. It has gone down, but the reality of how inflation works, of course, is that it measures the rate of growth. Not only are we dealing with a 2.7% increase; we're still dealing with a legacy of having inflation at 6%, 7% and 8%. Those rates are still built into the prices. Those prices have not come down; they're simply not growing as fast. That pain is still being inflicted on Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8460561" data-originallang="en"> Of course, we saw three major reports out today that were calling the Canadian economy further into question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8460562" data-originallang="en">This happens nearly every time with any type of socialist government. You get to a certain point, and even the most ardent of ideologues and believers struggle with rationalizing the poor results. The only way that they can rationalize it to themselves and to others is to find a bogeyman, a straw man argument—it's someone else's fault.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8460563" data-originallang="en">The Liberal government has tried many different culprits or villains. They've said the economy was a global problem. They've said—this is more the NDP—that the high costs are the result of corporate greed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8460564" data-originallang="en">The challenge with those narratives is they don't fit the timing of what has happened. It isn't as if grocery stores were all the best citizens, were not self-interested and were benevolent in nature prior to three years ago, and then they all suddenly got greedy. The timing just doesn't work. There's no correlation or causation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8460565" data-originallang="en">There's no doubt grocery stores, like many other companies, are self-interested. They are profit-seeking organizations. However, that hasn't changed. It was the same five, 10 and 20 years ago. Now there are reforms that we can put in place, such as allowing additional competition, which will push prices down. It doesn't make sense.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8460566" data-originallang="en">Do you know what does fit? It almost jumps off the page, actually. It is the election of the Liberal government in 2015 and a slew of terrible economic data from productivity and GDP per capita. The graphs almost walk in lockstep with the election. If you're not a believer at that point, if you watch a line graph, then you should compare inflation, GDP per capita, and now unemployment numbers, which are now starting to pop up to over 6.1%.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8460567" data-originallang="en">That is with the expansion of the money supply. Milton Friedman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, said many years ago that inflation is and always will be a monetary policy creation. If you print more money, you get inflation. It's really that simple.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8460568" data-originallang="en">What exacerbates that in Canada—and also in many other failed socialist experiments—is that if you have more dollars chasing fewer goods, then they're going to get more expensive even quicker. What you want is an economy that has a firm monetary policy that allows a dollar to be worth a dollar, but that's also producing a surplus—hopefully a surplus—of goods and services. The more services and goods an economy can provide, by definition, the more the price will go down.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8460569" data-originallang="en">I've only made it to the second paragraph here of this article. I should probably continue. I'll just read the last line so we have some flow here. It says:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8460570" data-originallang="en"> For example, M1+, which is currency held by the public in...chequable deposits at financial institutions, is still growing at a jaw-dropping [rate of] 14 per cent. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8460571" data-originallang="en"> To put that in perspective: to maintain an inflation rate around two per cent and allow a bit of a margin to prevent deflation, the money supply should grow at [between] five to six per cent.... We are currently [well] above that. Meanwhile, the current policy interest rate is at...0.5 per cent, well below...the most conservative estimates of the “neutral” rate—the rate consistent with full employment and stable inflation, which the bank estimates [at between] 1.75 and 2.75 per cent. Conclusion? Monetary policy is highly inflationary right now. </p>
</blockquote>
