<p data-HoCid="7723298" data-originallang="en">Okay. Thank you. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7723299" data-originallang="en">With regard to the work your organizations are doing in the field, can you speak very briefly about what this would look like? I think we've become very focused on Afghanistan because, of course, that is the impetus for this bill and what we've been calling for, for 18 months. However, we all know that organizations work in multiple situations where humanitarian aid and international development are all required.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7723300" data-originallang="en">Can you talk a little bit about the implications of this bill for your work in other areasâ€”for example, Gaza, Nigeria, Mali, the Central African Republic and Sudan?</p>
