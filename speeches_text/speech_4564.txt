<p data-HoCid="8493678" data-originallang="en"> I would like to get monthly statistics. Also, on the question around statistics, I asked at the Gaza meeting for the breakdown of the immigration level numbers related to the variety of different special immigration measures. That was on May 27, so by the end of this week it will have been two weeks.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8493679" data-originallang="en"> Can we actually get that information by next Monday? It pertains to this study as well</p>
<p data-HoCid="8493680" data-originallang="en"> Can I get a confirmation for that?</p>
