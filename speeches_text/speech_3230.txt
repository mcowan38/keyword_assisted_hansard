<p data-HoCid="8100476" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100477" data-originallang="en">To confirm, I am subbed in, so that clarifies the specifics associated with this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100478" data-originallang="en">We have before us a common-sense motion. Over the last number of weeks, in the aftermath of the horrific invasion that took place by Hamas into Israel on October 7, we have been thrust into a situation in which our friends in Israel and in the Jewish community around the world have faced attacks in an unprecedented way. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8100479" data-originallang="en">What we have before us is a simple opportunity to not just stand for the people of Israel and the Jewish community in our country, but to truly stand on the side of freedom, to stand up for the rights and freedoms that we all take so seriously. At least I would hope that we all take them very, very seriously.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100480" data-originallang="en">To recap, the motion here would do five simple things:</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100481" data-originallang="en">One, it would designate the IRGC as a terrorist entity under the Criminal Code and expel an estimated 700—let me emphasize that, 700—Iranian agents operating in Canada; two, it would establish a foreign influence registry; three, it would evaluate Canada's threat assessment in light of the U.K. travel advisory; four, it would remove red tape and speed up access to the security infrastructure program to protect communities at risk; and five, it would create an anti-hate crime task force to coordinate the protection of faith communities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100482" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, the reason it's important to dive into the substance of this motion is that it speaks to one of the fundamental values that defines us as Canadians. That is the very idea of freedom. That freedom includes freedom of association, freedom of expression and freedom of religion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100483" data-originallang="en">I have a number of examples. I've spoken to people of faith within the communities I represent, where they have felt persecuted. This is across the spectrum, with those in the Jewish community, in the Muslim community and in the Christian community, and with those without a faith. They have felt a level of an erosion of the faith that we have traditionally had in the freedoms we enjoy in this country. It's a fear that the Canadian experience and the freedoms associated with that are eroding.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100484" data-originallang="en">This motion is a simple, straightforward and practical way that we can emphasize how important we deem the preservation of these freedoms in light of what has happened in Israel and what has been the experience of far too many across our country who have faced persecution and, in some cases, hatred for their belief system. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8100485" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, I've spoken with a number of constituents related to church burnings. There have been a number of churches burned down in the communities I represent. There is fear as they endeavour to rebuild after a devastating act that destroyed what was seen as a safe place in the community and in those parishioners' lives. It speaks to how important it is, and how unequivocally we need to act.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100486" data-originallang="en">I said that I would be brief, although there is much that I would love to talk about related to this. To wrap up my comments, I will simply say this. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8100487" data-originallang="en">We have seen a growing disconnect between Parliament and the executive in our country. In the 42nd Parliament, more than four years ago, Parliament voted, unanimously is my understanding—I was not a member then—to designate the IRGC as a terrorist entity. We've seen support for a foreign influence registry. We've seen wide support for the other three items that were brought forward.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100488" data-originallang="en"> The disconnect that exists between the parliamentary system and the executive of our government in Canada is very concerning. I would hope all members take it seriously, because that disconnect further contributes to an erosion of trust that can take place. It strikes at the heart of what our democracy is and the essential provisions that are required to preserve what I shared in relation to the freedoms we enjoy as Canadians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100489" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, to conclude, this motion is simple and straightforward. It's common sense, so we can ensure that we bring home a level of security and safety and preserve freedom in the great country we call Canada. It's to protect those who need protection at a time when many see an erosion of trust. It can be done. Let's buck that trend. Let's get this done. Let's support it before this committee. Let's ensure that we have the opportunity before the House of Commons to ask that same question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100490" data-originallang="en">I would hope that every MP would stand in favour of common sense.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100491" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
