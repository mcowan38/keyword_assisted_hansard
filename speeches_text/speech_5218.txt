<p data-HoCid="8679157" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679158" data-originallang="fr">Thank you to the witnesses for being here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679159" data-originallang="fr">I thank Mr. Allen for the last answer he gave. I found it extremely enlightening about the spurious objections to recognizing the state of Palestine that are often raised.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679160" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Kersten, when countries like Slovenia, Spain, Norway and Ireland say that, in recognizing the Palestinian state, they are not recognizing, legitimizing or supporting Hamas in any way, it may seem a bit contradictory in the minds of lay people.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679161" data-originallang="fr">In your experience as a lawyer, what is the difference between recognizing a state and recognizing a government?</p>
