<p data-HoCid="7345606" data-originallang="en">Thank you so much, Mr. Minister. I appreciate that. I think many people don't know your past history before being elected of working with CIJA and working with the Jewish community to fight anti-Semitism. I think it's important that people know that you were fighting anti-Semitism long before you became a minister.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345607" data-originallang="en">Let me ask a second question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345608" data-originallang="en">My colleague Mr. Julian talked about the vetting procedure, which is very important. Equally important is the training. I was very pleased to hear that the Jewish Public Servants' Network, which has been complaining to me quite a lot about the lack of coherence about anti-Semitism training in different departments, is going to be part of this process. We can use this as an opportunity to create the best anti-Semitism and other forms of racism training, which you can then implement not only in your department, but across departments, which is excellent.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345609" data-originallang="en">I want to get to the question of the attestation and the contract, because one of the problems here was that the termination clause in the existing contract didn't allow you the immediate opportunity to terminate the agreement. That's what I'm getting.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345610" data-originallang="en">Can you talk about what termination rights the minister will now have in the contracts in the event that somebody like Mr. Marouf is found to have made such statements?</p>
