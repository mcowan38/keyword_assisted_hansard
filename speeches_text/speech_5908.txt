Certainly in Europe, you have more movement by barge, etc. It's there that we need to focus, and it's also the integrated nature of our economy and the integrated nature of the rail system to make sure that what we're doing in Canada doesn't create a sticky border for the movement of goods, because that's not in anybody's interest. We can align, and we can drive improvements in areas that are unique to Canada.</p>

One of the key calls for action for the United States after the East Palestine incident was why they don't have ERAPs like Canada does.</p>

The work is, “And what's next?” and not, “We don't have anything; it's not functioning, and it's not good.” It's, “Where are we, and where's the best place we can make more improvements with best efforts going forward?”</p>
