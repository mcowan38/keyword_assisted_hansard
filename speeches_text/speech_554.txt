<p data-HoCid="6485147" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6485148" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Chan, Mr. Dinsdale and Ms. Curran, it's great to see you here. Thank you for coming.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6485149" data-originallang="en">I have three quick things. First, I think the email between Mr. Chan and Mr. Ripley has been adequately dealt with.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6485150" data-originallang="en">Second, I greatly appreciate Facebook's recent decision to ban Holocaust denial on its platform. I also appreciate your quarterly transparency reports. I wish that other platforms would do the same.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6485151" data-originallang="en">Third, many of my constituents and I share a real frustration about the growing amount of anti-Semitism on the platform and the lack of response with respect to complaints that are made. I'd request to have a call with you guys on that, separately, if that's okay.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6485152" data-originallang="en">I have a lot of questions. If you can answer in one word yes or no, or briefly, that would be great. If not, I'll ask you to follow up in writing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6485153" data-originallang="en">There are about two and a half billion people who are regular users of Facebook and about 23 million in Canada. A number of those people do post messages that violate Facebook policies. Would you agree that Facebook has an obligation to deal with that content, Mr. Chan?</p>
