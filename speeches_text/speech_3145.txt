<p class="procedural" data-HoCid="8085671">moved for leave to introduce Bill <a data-HoCid="12758397" href="/bills/44-1/C-369/" title="An Act respecting Christian Heritage Month">C-369, An Act respecting Christian Heritage Month</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8085672" data-originallang="fr">Madam Speaker, it is an honour for me to rise to introduce this bill, which seeks to make December Christian heritage month.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8085673" data-originallang="en">Canada is a country that celebrates all faiths. We have Sikh Heritage Month, Hindu Heritage Month, Muslim history month, Jewish Heritage Month and so many more. It is only fair and right that we have a Christian heritage month, since there are 19.6 million Christians in Canada according to the last census.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8085674" data-originallang="en">What better month to pick than December? It starts with the season of Advent, the lighting of the hope candle, the lighting of the love candle and the lighting of the peace candle and joy candle, and culminates in the lighting of the Christ candle as we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ at Christmas, the saviour of the world.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8085675" data-originallang="en">We heard the Bloc speak last week about the importance of Christmas in Quebec. We heard the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> talk about the importance of Christmas to all Canadians. I hope all my colleagues will join me in supporting this private member's bill to make December Christian heritage month.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8085676" data-originallang="en">Merry Christmas.</p>
