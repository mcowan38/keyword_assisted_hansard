Christmas trees will be GST- and HST-free in Newfoundland and Labrador, but as for the decorations that go on them, hopefully people have some from last year because decorations will still have HST and GST in Newfoundland and Labrador. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8739245" data-originallang="en">Menorahs are not included, so is there some anti-Semitism going on? We know the government is anti-seniors and anti-disabled because those needy groups will not be allowed to receive the $250 cheques that people making $150,000 are going to receive. Also, the federal pension plan was just robbed of $2 million, and where did that go? Was it to this fake Christmas gift? </p>
