<p data-HoCid="8017804" data-originallang="en">In the Transportation Safety Board's own words, “New technologies for enhancing train brake performance are available to North American railways now.” It was years ago that they made this recommendation. I'm surprised it hasn't been implemented.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8017805" data-originallang="en">Turning to another quote from Kathy Fox, the chair, in the wake of the East Palestine train derailment in February this year, she said, “Progress is being made, but it's very, very slow...I can't say [Ohio] couldn't happen here.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8017806" data-originallang="en">Here we have a recommendation from years ago that hasn't been implemented—railcars in Canada don't have automated parking brakes—and we have the Transportation Safety Board, which is the watchdog that's supposed to help us understand whether companies like yours are actually making railways safer and whether the recommendations are being followed.... She's saying the progress is too slow and we could still have something like this major disaster happen here in Canada.</p>
