<p data-HoCid="8435027" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435028" data-originallang="en">Mr. Marceau you said earlier that political leaders must lead. I would argue that the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> is leading but in the wrong way.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435029" data-originallang="en">Since October 7, they have voted for a one-sided, anti-Israel motion at the United Nations, and a motion that was passed in the House of Commons punished Israel and rewarded Hamas. It punished Israel by blocking arms sales and rewarded Hamas by reinstating funding for UNRWA, which I know you are currently suing the federal government over. As well, they failed to unequivocally condemn the frivolous genocide convention claim launched in South Africa</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435030" data-originallang="en"> If leadership comes from the top, this is exactly the wrong kind of leadership we need in the face of a B'nai Brith report that shows that anti-Semitism since October 7 has spiked by 208%. Wouldn't you agree?</p>
