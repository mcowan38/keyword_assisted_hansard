<p data-HoCid="6449206" data-originallang="en">In determining the members for the national housing council, there was a robust selection process that took into consideration a number of factors, including lived experience, as Ms. Gazan mentioned, professional expertise of the various nominees and their experience in the housing domain.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6449207" data-originallang="en">All these factors were taken into consideration in choosing members who we believe are very well qualified to provide us with guidance and instruction in terms of developing the national housing strategy further.</p>
