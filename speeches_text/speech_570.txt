<p data-HoCid="6446321" data-originallang="fr">My question is for Mr. Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6446322" data-originallang="fr">You said that the funding was too compartmentalized, that it does not help connect Canadians and that the funding needs to be brought together under a single national program.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6446323" data-originallang="fr">Can you talk about the benefits of a single funding envelope?</p>
