<p data-HoCid="6965113" data-originallang="fr">Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, whom I also appreciate very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6965114" data-originallang="fr">I could not agree more with her. I looked at the protesters flying American flags, Canadian flags, Quebec flags and so on. It is easy to conflate all the causes and make comparisons to anti-Semitism. However, we are really far from that. If we were in a situation like the one Poland and Germany experienced in the dark years we would prefer to forget but can never forget, the Emergencies Act would obviously be called for. However, we are not there.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6965115" data-originallang="fr">Conflating situations like this is dangerous. First, it does a disservice to the memory of victims of the Holocaust. Second, it undermines the sound, informed and intelligent management of situations here at home.</p>
