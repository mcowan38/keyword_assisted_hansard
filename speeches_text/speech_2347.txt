<p data-HoCid="7735674" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Ms. Saks.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7735675" data-originallang="en">I'll just make sure the committee members have the subamendment. I have “amendment” here because this was a new clause that was moved by Ms. Gazan. We have a subamendment currently moved by Ms. Saks.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7735676" data-originallang="en">The legislative clerk has received the subamendment. It is in order. We'll move to a discussion on it as soon as the clerk has circulated it to all committee members.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7735677" data-originallang="en">The clerk has advised that the subamendment of Ms. Saks on the new clause 14.1, as moved by Ms. Gazan, is in order. You should all have it, so we will move to debate on the subamendment of Ms. Saks.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7735678" data-originallang="en">Ms. Gazan, did you have your hand up on that?</p>
