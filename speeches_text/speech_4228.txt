<p data-HoCid="8435562" data-originallang="fr"> Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435563" data-originallang="fr">I would like to start by thanking the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development for inviting me to appear as part of its study on Canada's approach to Africa.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435564" data-originallang="fr">This important reflection is taking place just a few days ahead of the celebrations for Africa Day, initially Africa Freedom Day, held each year on May 25, in memory of the founding of the Organization of African Unity.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435565" data-originallang="fr">For the past 15 years, I've lived and worked in West Africa, North Africa and East Africa. I'd like to mention that, although I was born in East Africa, I grew up and studied in Canada. It was in this country that I was offered my first job after I graduated. It was a project to strengthen the technical skills of Palestinian women in Gaza in the occupied Palestinian territories, a project that was funded at the time by the Canadian International Development Agency.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435566" data-originallang="fr">Regarding my participation in this important study on Canada's approach to Africa, I'd like to begin with a personal reflection on the potential approach.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435567" data-originallang="fr">Will Canada's approach to Africa be businesslike, profit-seeking and condescending, or will it be based on universal values and principles?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435568" data-originallang="fr">It's important to remember that Africa, the cradle of humanity, is a huge continent that is now home to a vast community of nations spread across 54 sovereign states. After Asia, it is the world's second most populous continent, representing one fifth of the world's population, over 70% of whom are young people.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435569" data-originallang="fr">Africa is also a continent rich in natural resources, in minerals—it has 30% of the world's mineral reserves—and available agricultural land. Seen in this light, is it Africa that needs Canada, or Canada that needs the African continent?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435570" data-originallang="fr">While the African continent has its share of difficulties, tragedies and challenges, its potential is just as impressive. Indeed, it boasts a demographic vitality that is fostering the rapid growth of a large middle class, an increasingly well-educated population, abundant natural resources, a more open trade framework thanks to the recent signing by all African countries of an agreement establishing a continent-wide free‑trade zone, and significant diplomatic weight in international forums.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435571" data-originallang="fr">So what approach should Canada take to the African continent?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435572" data-originallang="fr">Before answering that question, let me remind you of the role Canada played after the devastation of the Second World War. At a time when the western world was in the midst of reconstruction and the African continent was engaged in struggles for liberation and independence, Canada could have decided to stay in its corner and opt for isolation. Instead, it decided to play a leading role in shaping a new world order. This bold policy, described by many as the diplomacy of hope, was aimed at creating and strengthening international institutions capable of producing rules and standards to guide international relations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435573" data-originallang="fr">Thanks to the diplomacy of hope, Canada was able to build a distinct identity, becoming a much‑appreciated mediator between north and south, a promoter of the multilateral system and of peace, notably through the creation of the peacekeepers. Canada's diplomatic activism has paid dividends. The country has been elected six times as a non‑permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. What's more, its expertise in disarmament and peacekeeping has been sought out the world over, and has enabled it to play an important role in a number of forums.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435574" data-originallang="fr">Today, we are living through a period of far greater change than the one in 1945. The world is in the throes of geopolitical transformation, with international relations undergoing profound change and moving towards the establishment of a multipolar world. In this new multipolar world, we are witnessing the emergence of a new balance of power between north and south, in which African countries are demanding that their sovereignty be respected, including their choice of geopolitical alliances and governance.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435575" data-originallang="fr">Whatever happens, one thing is certain: Canada can no longer behave like the good missionary of the last century. It is this reality that must shape Canada's new approach to the African continent. Now is not the time for Canada's current indifference or retreat, but rather, it's time for a bold and ambitious commitment that will set it apart from other economic powers.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435576" data-originallang="fr">To make a real difference on the African continent, Canada should adopt an approach inspired by universalist values, focusing on the following three areas: pragmatic diplomacy and diplomatic activism focused on reforming international institutions to better shape international relations in a multipolar world; more equitable co‑operation and exchanges, where Canadian expertise and technological innovations could help change the game, notably in the fields of culture, education, health, renewable energies, as well as the digital, social and circular economy, and so on.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435577" data-originallang="fr"> Finally, Canada needs to be more open and transparent, to increase multidisciplinary exchanges with African universities and to work more closely with cultural and sports centres on the African continent, in conjunction with the African diaspora in Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435578" data-originallang="fr">Thank you for your rapt attention.</p>
