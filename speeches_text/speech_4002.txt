<p data-HoCid="8372824" data-originallang="en"> I call the meeting to order.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372825" data-originallang="en"> We're resuming meeting 105 of the House of Commons Standing Committee on the Status of Women.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372826" data-originallang="en">On avoiding audio feedback, before we begin, a few things have changed. I would like to remind all members and other meeting participants in the room of the following important preventative measures.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372827" data-originallang="en">To prevent disruption and potentially harmful audio feedback incidents that can cause injuries, all in-person participants are reminded to keep their earpieces away from the microphones at all times. As indicated in the communiqu√© from the Speaker to all members on Monday, April 29, the following measures have been taken to help prevent audio feedback incidents.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372828" data-originallang="en">All earpieces have been replaced with a model that greatly reduces the probability of audio feedback. The new earpieces are black whereas the former earpieces were grey. Please use a only black, approved earpiece. By default, all unused earpieces will be unplugged at the start of the meeting. When you are not using your earpiece, please place it face down in the middle of the sticker for that purpose that you will find on the table as indicated.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372829" data-originallang="en">Please consult the cards on the table for guidelines to prevent audio feedback incidents.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372830" data-originallang="en">The room layout has also been adjusted to increase the distance between microphones and reduce the chance of feedback from an ambient earpiece. These measures are in place so we can conduct our business without interruption and to protect the health and safety of all participants, including the interpreters.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372831" data-originallang="en">Thank you for your co-operation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372832" data-originallang="en">I would also like to make a few comments for the benefit of the members.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372833" data-originallang="en">Before speaking, please wait until I recognize you by name. All comments shall be addressed through the chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372834" data-originallang="en">As everyone is aware, we suspended the debate on Ms. Gazan's motion at the last meeting. We are now ready to resume the debate on that motion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8372835" data-originallang="en">The text of the motion is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8372836" data-originallang="en"> That the committee thank MP Vecchio for her years of service as chair of the committee. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8372837" data-originallang="en">Before we start, I would like to inform the members of the list that we had ongoing from the last meeting. The current speaking list is: Dominique Vien, Anna Roberts, Michelle Ferreri, Anita Vandenbeld and Pam Damoff. Since Pam is not here today, she is not on the list.</p>
