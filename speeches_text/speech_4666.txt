<p data-HoCid="8520205" data-originallang="fr">Many tools are now available in the Criminal Code to deal with terrorism offences, especially those in which hatred is incited to carry out the act of terrorism. A number of prosecutions are under way in cases where a key element is the use of the Internet to create a climate of hate, especially in relation to Islamophobia and anti-Semitism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8520206" data-originallang="fr">The Criminal Code already allows the PPSC to tackle that problem, which is much more serious now, right across the country. A recent prosecution that comes to mind is the case in London, Ontario, involving the attack on the Afzaal family.</p>
