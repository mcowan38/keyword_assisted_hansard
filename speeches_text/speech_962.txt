<p data-HoCid="6700169" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6700170" data-originallang="en">Dr. Evans, my questions are for you as well. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6700171" data-originallang="en">I'm picking up on that international piece that you were just speaking of. Obviously there's lots of data, but some of the helpful data that I think a lot of us are looking to is from the U.K. and Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6700172" data-originallang="en">You mentioned that the only way to get to herd immunity is through vaccination. One of the things we've noticed is this idea of loosening public health measures too soon, and Israel and the U.K. had instances of this. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6700173" data-originallang="en">I'm curious whether you're looking at this. How much do you factor in that international kind of experience in your work? I would assume, given the topic, that any data is helpful, but in terms of spikes until vaccinations can do their work, do you have any models or indicators that would be helpful in determining some of that balance between public health measures and vaccinations, moving out? </p>
