<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the slogan that I have referenced is used at Canadian pro-Hamas terror rallies and sends a message of intolerance and hatred towards an identifiable group of Canadians, a minority, the Jewish community.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Is our government and the hate propaganda enforcement system that oblivious to the obvious?</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">I cannot emphasize enough that delaying a rapid and direct response to hate propaganda and racism is a matter that Canadians are very concerned about. The federal government cannot ignore or sidestep its responsibilities to upholding Canada's hate laws and their provisions, and working to eradicate anti-Semitism here in Canada. As is the case with justice, delaying a response to racism and hate denies the removal of the scourge. Anti-Semitism must be met directly and by the full extent of Canadian law. That takes action, not more platitudes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">I will ask again. Will the government take direct action to address this recurring hate?</p>
