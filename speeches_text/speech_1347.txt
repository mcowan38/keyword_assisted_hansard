<p data-HoCid="6939879" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, last week, my Conservative caucus colleagues and I had the distinct privilege of carrying through our motion to review and amend our Canadian Constitution.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6939880" data-originallang="en">By unanimously removing a long-standing tax provision that granted special treatment to a large corporation, all members of the House played a critical role in opening up and fixing that error in our Constitution. Although not necessarily a headline-grabbing initiative, removing red tape and unfair provisions of our Constitution is an important task, and part of the responsibility our constituents have entrusted us with in sending us all here. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6939881" data-originallang="en">Tensions have been running high in the House for weeks as we debate issues that are important and have a direct impact on the future of all Canadians. Given the fraught environment we currently find ourselves in, the rarity of finding unanimous consent on any issue is not lost on me. I thank members of the House, especially my 13 Saskatchewan Conservative colleagues, for the show of unity in getting this important work done. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6939882" data-originallang="en">We will always be on Saskatchewanâ€™s side. After all, if we do not respect the Constitution, do we have respect for anything?</p>
