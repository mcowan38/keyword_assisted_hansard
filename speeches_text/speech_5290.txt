<p data-HoCid="8661038" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, today, a tragedy shames our nation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8661039" data-originallang="en">Judi Weinstein, a proud Canadian, was the only Canadian hostage still held by Hamas in Gaza. A beloved teacher, Judi and her husband were brutally murdered and taken hostage in the savage attacks on October 7. For 83 days, Judi's family waited in agony, unsure of her fate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8661040" data-originallang="en"> Since that horrific day, Judi and her husband's deceased bodies have been held as human currency, depriving their family of closure. The United States has already taken action. It has issued indictments against Hamas perpetrators, against terrorists responsible for attacks upon Americans.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8661041" data-originallang="en">Where is the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>? He is nowhere. He and his <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="MÃ©lanie Joly">foreign affairs minister</a> have failed to confront Hamas terrorists at every turn. We have demanded that Judi be brought home and that terrorists be indicted. The world is watching. Today, Judi's daughter, Iris, is here in Ottawa. We stand with her. </p>
