<p data-HoCid="7345540" data-originallang="en">There's obviously a problem. We have two ministers who are compiling and working in one file. When we have one minister having to get information from another department, we have a delay. In this case, it was over a month of very virulent, toxic and anti-Semitic comments basically continuing to be funded by the federal government over that period.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345541" data-originallang="en">I don't have reassurance from the minister right now that the kind of social media screen that is so important—whether we're talking about anti-Semitism or misogyny—has been clearly put into place to stop this from happening again. That is a matter of some concern.</p>
