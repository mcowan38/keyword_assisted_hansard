<p data-HoCid="7200343" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, today it is my honour to rise on behalf of Republic Day in Azerbaijan.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7200344" data-originallang="en">Azerbaijan is an amazing country, full of diversity and even contradictions. It is a country where the majority of the population is Muslim. However, it has also been a refuge for hundreds of years to thousands of folks of the Jewish religion. It is a country where, when the Soviet Union tore down churches, Muslims paid to rebuild them. It is a country that embraces renewables, but is proud of its oil and gas industry, an industry that built pipelines over mountains, through seas and across multiple jurisdictions, which literally kept the lights on in southern Europe.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7200345" data-originallang="en">Azerbaijan is a country that has much to be proud of over the last 104 years, but perhaps even more importantly it has much to contribute over the next 100 years. I wish members a happy Azerbaijan Republic Day.</p>
