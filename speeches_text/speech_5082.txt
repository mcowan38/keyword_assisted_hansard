<p data-HoCid="8667123" data-originallang="en"> Ms. Curran, I'm holding a report from Human Rights Watch that is entitled “Meta's Broken Promises—Systemic Censorship on Palestine Content on Instagram and Facebook.” The opening line states that “Meta’s policies and practices have been silencing voices in support of Palestine and Palestinian human rights on Instagram and Facebook in a wave of heightened censorship of social media amid the hostilities between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups that began on October 7, 2023.” </p>
<p data-HoCid="8667124" data-originallang="en"> Are you familiar with this report?</p>
