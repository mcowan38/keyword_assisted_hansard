<p data-HoCid="7705322" data-originallang="en">Thank you so much, Madam Chair. Everything will just be from me and not through you, which is a bit unusual for me in this space.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7705323" data-originallang="en">I want to thank everybody for taking the time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7705324" data-originallang="en">This is a minor change to reflect what is, I think, a better name for the riding I represent. Right now, the North Island component of my riding is very similar to the provincial riding, which is also called “North Island”, so that part is fine. It's a good name that makes sense.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7705325" data-originallang="en">On the other side of my riding, of course, is a huge chunk of the mainland. I have a neighbour here with me in committee today, and we share an area in common. That is the Powell River part of my riding—a name reflective of just one community, not the many communities that are represented. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7705326" data-originallang="en">My suggestion to the commission is to change the words “Powell River” to the word “qathet”. This is a name the Tla'amin nation gave to the regional district of Powell River. They received it with much graciousness, then changed their regional name—their district—to reflect that name: qathet. If you go to that area now, you'll see that a lot of businesses and organizations have changed their name from “Powell River” to reflect the more regional approach. “qathet” means “working together”, and I respect the nation's name and the presentation of that name. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7705327" data-originallang="en"> I recommend that the name be “North Island—qathet” and recognize that the nations related to Tla'amin—K’ómoks, Homalco and Klahoose, which have a shared culture and language—have all agreed to this change and respect that. I have had a conversation with the Powell River mayor. He did not express any concerns at the time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7705328" data-originallang="en">I also want to make sure the committee understands that Powell River was named after Israel Wood Powell. He was the first superintendent for Indian Affairs in British Columbia and the chief architect of colonial policies, including residential schools and the banning of the potlatch. It's my understanding that he never came to the community.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7705329" data-originallang="en">I hope everyone can agree. I know that is the normal practice and thank you for taking some time with me today. </p>
