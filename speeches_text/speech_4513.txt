<p data-HoCid="8455616" data-originallang="en">Anti-Semitism isn't new—we've been hearing that—and the history of anti-Semitism at universities isn't new. In fact, in our next panel, we will have several universities sitting here who had quotas on the number of Jewish people who could attend certain programs or be in their universities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455617" data-originallang="en">Do you have an inventory of which universities had that systemic anti-Semitism baked into their policies? Is that not something that needs to be addressed going forward?</p>
