<p data-HoCid="7908174" data-originallang="en"> That's going to come out of what would go to pensioners.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7908175" data-originallang="en">This is the problem I have. We did this study to look at highly paid consultants. Now we're way off track from where we were going.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7908176" data-originallang="en">I put forward a motion to expand it and include the other five highly paid consulting firms, which are getting much more money than McKinsey. I didn't ask for every single document, because I was worried about the costs associated with that and the demands. We have a pretty good idea that they're skyrocketing. The government is basically privatizing work that should be in the public service. I have concerns around that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7908177" data-originallang="en">I have real concerns about the cost of how this is happening for taxpayers. I'm deeply concerned about that. I'm deeply concerned about redaction and how we walk through this. I'm looking for some solutions, some sort of pathway to find a bridge between this committee and government so we can get the answers we need.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7908178" data-originallang="en">Certainly, I'm really concerned about the fact that we've spent 13 meetings now just on McKinsey. We haven't even gotten to Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers and the rest of them. This is 13 meetings. We're at nine studies in this committee. We haven't produced a single report, because we're going down rabbit holes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7908179" data-originallang="en">I'd like to find a pathway here so we don't spend more time on this and we can get some answers. Do you have any ideas?</p>
