<p data-HoCid="8752271" data-originallang="en"> Thank you so much, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8752272" data-originallang="en"> I thank the honourable member for his words. I agree with him. It's extremely concerning what's going on right now. I've had numerous conversations with Rabbi Stephen Wise in my riding about the rise of anti-Semitism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8752273" data-originallang="en"> I just read an article about the number of youth being radicalized to ISIS. We also have another problem in this country, which is the rise of Islamophobia and the rise of youth being radicalized, predominantly online.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8752274" data-originallang="en"> Chair, I also had put in a motion. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8752275" data-originallang="en">I'm hoping that we can deal with Ms. Southern, who's taken the time to come in today, and we've summoned them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8752276" data-originallang="en"> I would like to read the motion that I have. I'm hoping that we can have a more fulsome debate on this at a future meeting.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8752277" data-originallang="en"> The motion that I had proposedâ€”</p>
