<p data-HoCid="8693569" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693570" data-originallang="en">Thank you to our witnesses for appearing. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693571" data-originallang="en">We heard at our last committee meeting about the support—current support, historical support—for a two-state solution in the region. My view is that there can be no lasting and durable peace in the Middle East unless there is a negotiated settlement between Israelis and Palestinians that results in that two-state solution and that also has the popular support of both Israelis and Palestinians. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693572" data-originallang="en">I'm interested in exploring the historical levels of support in the State of Israel among the Palestinian people for a two-state solution and the present levels of support. I'm wondering if our witnesses could speak to that fact. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693573" data-originallang="en">As I understand it, there are about 9.8 million Israeli citizens. I'm wondering what the levels of support have been historically for a two-state solution and what the levels of support are presently. Also, approximately five million residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip are Palestinian. I'm wondering how levels of support for a two-state solution have varied historically among that second population. </p>
