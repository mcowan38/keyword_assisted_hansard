<p data-HoCid="8452585" data-originallang="en"> Madam Speaker, the member identifies something that we have acknowledged: the presence of systemic racism in policing institutions and other governmental institutions. It is a concern that we share with her.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8452586" data-originallang="en"> Again, one of the constructive elements of the work done by colleagues at the committee, including the <a data-HoCid="278812" href="/politicians/peter-julian/" title="Peter Julian">House leader of the New Democratic Party</a>, was the ability to collect race-based data and to look at the issues around overrepresentation of racialized people and indigenous people in the criminal justice system. Sadly, in many cases, the entry point for many of these people in the criminal justice system is interactions with the police or conceivably the Canada Border Services Agency. That is why it is important that the appropriate people be appointed to this oversight group to ensure that exactly the kind of concern that our colleague from <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> raises is addressed at the highest levels and with the utmost vigour.</p>
