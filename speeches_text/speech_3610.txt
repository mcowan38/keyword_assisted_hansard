<p data-HoCid="8276115" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, today Liberals have the chance to stand up for peace and justice. The <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="MÃ©lanie Joly">minister</a> and her government keep talking about a commitment to a two-state solution, yet the Liberals refuse to recognize two states. There are 139 countries that recognize the state of Palestine. Canada does not. As it stands, Canada continues to deny the most fundamental right of self-determination to the Palestinian people.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8276116" data-originallang="en">When is Canada going to back up its supposed commitment to a two-state solution by recognizing the state of Palestine? Will the Liberals support this motion and finally recognize the state of Palestine?</p>
