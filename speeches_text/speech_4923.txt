<p data-HoCid="8576817" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I know that my colleague has a very kind heart. Like me, he is deeply worried about so many Lebanese Canadians right now. So many people across this country are grieving and are so afraid of what is happening in the region and of the risk of escalation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576818" data-originallang="en">We have heard from the Jordanian foreign affairs minister that Netanyahu does not want a two-state solution. If we ask Israeli officials what their end game is, what is it other than just war and more war?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576819" data-originallang="en">What we have seen is that the escalation, the counterattacks and the back and forth have done nothing except hurt civilians, hurt innocent people, traumatize populations and destroy cities and communities. Rightly, the people in Lebanon are deeply worried that their cities and their communities will be flattened the way that Gaza has been. I wonder whether the member could talk about what he has heard from his constituents about that.</p>
