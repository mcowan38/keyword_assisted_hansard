<p data-HoCid="6649818" data-originallang="fr">I agree on the substance, and I wanted to mention it to Ms. Gazan, among others. At the same time, I had trouble believing that there was a double standard and that it was considered acceptable. As Mr. Anandasangaree mentioned twice in reference to chapter 16 of <em>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</em>, there is discussion of clarifications to amend the bill. I therefore consider that for my amendment, it's exactly the same thing. That, in my opinion, would make it a double standard, or at least inconsistent. I wanted to mention this before we vote. </p>
