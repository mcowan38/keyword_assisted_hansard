<p data-HoCid="8479573" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479574" data-originallang="en">Thank you to the witnesses for being here and for the powerful presentations, especially by Maryam.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479575" data-originallang="en">Dr. Islam, I'm a father of three, and I was in London after the tragedy happened. My daughter goes to school. She's in grade 9, and she wears a hijab. Since that incident, I haven't let her walk home or walk to school. My wife picks her up from and drops her off at school.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479576" data-originallang="en"> That incident has had a lasting impact on every Muslim in Canada. I'd never felt that way before. My kids and family had never felt that way prior to this event. When you were talking about the incident and the feelings of your son and daughter, I could relate that to my family.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479577" data-originallang="en">I want to ask how you feel about the court decision. I know you talked about it. You can see the government's response and our law enforcement and court's responses to that incident. Do you think we are working on improving how we tackle Islamophobia and anti-Semitism or not? What are your thoughts on that?</p>
