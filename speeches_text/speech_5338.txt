<p data-HoCid="8702997" data-originallang="en">Mr. Topas, you precondition the Palestinian state working toward the two-state solution with two things: One is for Iran to quit interfering, basically, in the Middle East affairs the way it is, and also that to have long-lasting peace, we need to go back to negotiation. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8702998" data-originallang="en">The Oslo accords created a platform for that. Where did the Oslo accords fail, and how can we go back? The war is going to end at some point, and everyone's going to go back to the negotiation table. Do you think that Oslo is still the platform on which we can go ahead and begin a negotiation toward a lasting peace? </p>
