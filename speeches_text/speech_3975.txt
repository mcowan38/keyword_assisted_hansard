<p data-HoCid="8324990" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the first words that come to mind when I think about what my colleague just expressed are Neville Chamberlain's level appeasement.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8324991" data-originallang="en">We cannot say that we stand with Israel or that Israel has a right to defend itself with credibility when we then say that we are not going to sell Israel weapons, after it was attacked by Iran's proxy, Hamas, and after it got attacked directly by Iran. That decision cannot stand. It has to be reversed. It has to be reversed right now. </p>
