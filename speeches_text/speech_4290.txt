<p data-HoCid="8435222" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435223" data-originallang="en"> I'd like to thank all the witnesses for joining us today and helping inform this committee on its study into this very difficult subject.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435224" data-originallang="en"> In a perfect world, universities are a place where we should be able to have difficult conversations on a wide range of subjects. I think all of our witnesses have clearly differentiated between that and the vile hatred that exists for so many Jewish students on campuses across Canada. Thank you for that. I think your comments, coming from the academic perspective, mirror and echo what this committee has heard from students, so thank you for adding that important perspective.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435225" data-originallang="en"> I'd like to turn my first question to the Network of Engaged Canadian Academics.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435226" data-originallang="en"> We're dealing with a number of jurisdictions here, federal and provincial, and one question I have for you involves that. This is the justice committee, and we're ultimately making recommendations to the federal government.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435227" data-originallang="en"> Is there anything additional that you would like to see in how the federal government works with post-secondary education ministers of provincial governments? Is there anything missing in that relationship or anything the federal government could do to aid those ministers in the responsibilities that they have for post-secondary institutions within their respective provinces?</p>
