<p data-HoCid="6791792" data-originallang="en">On that note, I am personally very pleased about the peacebuilding funding, the $25 million that the Canadian government has allocated. I worked on people-to-people initiatives, including some CIDA-funded ones in the early 1990s as part of the Oslo accords. They're essential for building the foundations for peace, for both Israelis and Palestinians in the region. </p>
