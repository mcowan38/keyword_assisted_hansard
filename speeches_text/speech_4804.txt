<p data-HoCid="8563323" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the violence in the Middle East needs to stop. We need to see hostages released. We need to see Hamas lay down its arms. We need a ceasefire. We need to get back on a path toward a two-state solution where we have a peaceful, secure, democratic Israel alongside a peaceful, secure, democratic Palestinian state.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8563324" data-originallang="en">That is Canada's position. That is what we are working with friends, allies and partners on in the region. That is what we will continue to work on every single day to bring peace and stability to that region.</p>
