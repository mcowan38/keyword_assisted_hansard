<p data-HoCid="8068665" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, today is recognized by the United Nations as International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8068666" data-originallang="en">The horrific toll of the most recent Israel-Hamas war is yet another example of the ongoing cycle of violence and injustice that has tragically gripped the region for decades. This has highlighted the need for a comprehensive resolution that delivers a hopeful future for Palestinians and long-term stability for the region. As is Canada's long-standing position, and as the UN declared by resolution in 1947, this means the creation of a viable Palestinian state living peacefully alongside an Israeli state. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8068667" data-originallang="en">For too long, the Palestinian people have been victimized by occupation and blockades, as well as a governing regime that disregards the rights and safety of its own people. Today is a reminder of the work that Canada, as well as the entire international community, owes to the Palestinian people to ensure they have equal access to the rights and freedoms that we and so many others take for granted.</p>
