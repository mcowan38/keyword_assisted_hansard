<p data-HoCid="8679375" data-originallang="fr">At the time of the Oslo accords, there was tremendous support on all sides for the peace process and mutual recognition. Even in Gaza, Hamas's popularity had fallen to zero, or close to it.</p>

In seven years, between 1993 and 2000, Israel moved four times as many settlers into the occupied territories as in the previous 25 years. All of this was done in violation of international law. However, no serious pressure was brought to bear to put an end to it. That's where the problem lies.</p>
