<p data-HoCid="6448617" data-originallang="fr">I would now like to turn to our witness from Islamic Relief Canada on an issue that has been raised a number of times during the work of this committee, and that is the difficulties that some UN agencies are experiencing, which are compounded by this health crisis. I'm thinking in particular of the Palestinian refugee agency, UNRWA.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6448618" data-originallang="fr">Do you work with Palestinian refugees or is this an area where you'd like to become more involved in the near future?</p>
