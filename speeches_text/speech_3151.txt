<p data-HoCid="8098599" data-originallang="en">In terms of the International Criminal Court, Canada's position is simply that it does not recognize that Palestine is a state and therefore, the ICC can't investigate in the country. What is notable about that is members of Parliament have repeatedly expressed their desire for Canada to investigate other situations in other countries that are not member states of the ICC, including China over the Xinjiang atrocities and Iran over its atrocities. I think those efforts are welcome.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098600" data-originallang="en">Again, I ask the question: If that is the rule and if we should be supporting investigations and prosecutions in those situations, why not everywhere? Why is this only happening sometimes?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098601" data-originallang="en">With respect to the International Court of Justice, Canada submitted a filing this past summer against the International Court of Justice's potential proceedings in relation to the legal consequences of the occupation in Palestine. I have a copy here. What is concerning there is that, at the very same time it did so, it was rightfully bringing Syria to the International Court of Justice with the Netherlands over torture. Again, this raises the question: Why is it okay for the ICJ to hear proceedings in relation to Syria but not in relation to Palestine?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098602" data-originallang="en">Perhaps what's most disturbing about Canada's filing at the ICJ is that it amounts to saying that Canada believes international law has no role to play whatsoever in the context of peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.</p>
