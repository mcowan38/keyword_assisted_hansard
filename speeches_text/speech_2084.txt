<p data-HoCid="7611593" data-originallang="en"> Minister, you mentioned the Canada child benefit. As you know, my colleague out of Winnipeg Centre, <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Leah Gazan</a>, has been really fighting hard against the clawbacks to the Canada child benefit. I wonder if you could update us on whether the government is actively ensuring that those families do not lose any of their very important income supports.</p>
