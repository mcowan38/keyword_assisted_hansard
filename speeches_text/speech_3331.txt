<p data-HoCid="8109772" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, I am very honoured tonight to enter into this debate. My colleagues from the indigenous caucus from the NDP, the member for <a data-HoCid="278619" href="/politicians/blake-desjarlais/" title="Blake Desjarlais">Edmonton Griesbach</a>, the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> and the member for <a data-HoCid="278704" href="/politicians/lori-idlout/" title="Lori Idlout">Nunavut</a>, have consistently and persistently emphasized, both within and outside our caucus, the importance of justice and basic human rights. When they say this, they mean for all people, and most particularly when they say this, they are talking about indigenous peoples.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8109773" data-originallang="en">I am dismayed. I have been here for eight years. I remember when the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> was first elected, he stood on the stage and said that there is no relationship more important than the relationship with indigenous peoples in the path toward reconciliation. What do we have to show for it eight years later? What comes to mind are incremental justice, incremental human rights and incremental progress for indigenous peoples, the first peoples of this land. As an immigrant, I came to this place and was allowed to stay by the grace of indigenous peoples, the very first people, Inuit, Métis and first nations people. However, they do not enjoy those rights.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8109774" data-originallang="en">We are still talking about it. Where is the justice in that? I find it so dismaying, because the government will say that we need to address the economy and that we have to ensure we have enough resources to build Canada. We will continually hear the Conservatives say that we cannot afford to do this and we cannot afford to do that. What are we talking about? We are talking about losing supports for a total of 7.6 billion dollars' worth of programming for indigenous services, indigenous peoples.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8109775" data-originallang="en">The government will say that is not a cut and not to say it is a cut. I do not know in what universe one could not describe it as a cut when those existing services will cease to exist when that $7.6 billion is lost. That equates a cut. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8109776" data-originallang="en">We are talking about Jordan's principle, an important principle that says the health and services of indigenous peoples', no matter where they are, should trump all bickering between levels of government about who is going to pay for what because the health of indigenous peoples comes first. However, we are now talking about cutting supports for Jordan's principle. It is not that Jordan's principle was perfect when it was first implemented. People in Vancouver East consistently have to fight to get those services and battle the bureaucracy to justify those services, and it is not an easy fight.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8109777" data-originallang="en">I think about the government's promise on the missing and murdered indigenous women and girls inquiry, the national inquiry that brought me to this place as an ally to fight for that. I was just looking today at a report card on the missing and murdered indigenous women and girls inquiry from the CBC, which reads:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8109778" data-originallang="en"> It’s been four years since the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls released 231 calls for justice. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8109779" data-originallang="en"> Those calls tackled 18 areas needing reform, including education, justice and health. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8109780" data-originallang="en"> To date, only two of the 231 calls have been completed — and more than half haven’t even been started, according to CBC’s analysis. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8109781" data-originallang="en">How is that going for incremental justice? When we talk about incremental justice, what is the fallout? What are the implications? In this instance, we are talking about the lives of indigenous women and girls. This is a travesty in my own community, where right now the RCMP has applied to destroy evidence for cases involving indigenous women and girls. What sort of shameful exercise is that?</p>
