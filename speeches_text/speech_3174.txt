<p data-HoCid="8119823" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8119824" data-originallang="fr">I want to thank all the witnesses for being here today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8119825" data-originallang="en">This is a really important study around disability. It's also a timely study.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8119826" data-originallang="en">I'd like to ask some questions around what is in the news today, in particular around conflict, to deepen our understanding of disability education with the nexus of conflict.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8119827" data-originallang="en">I'd like to start with the witness who finished her remarks last, Ms. Abualghaib.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8119828" data-originallang="en">I know that you have expertise in different parts of the world. You have worked amid several countriesâ€”70-odd countries.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8119829" data-originallang="en">Currently with the conflict in Gaza, according to UN agencies, over 15,000 people have lost their lives and many others are missing, 75% of whom are women and children. We are hearing reports about crush wounds and people being pulled out from under rubble and destroyed buildings. There's an intense need for medical care.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8119830" data-originallang="en">In this type of situation, where there is urban warfare and civilians are within the urban areas, what do you expect the outcomes will be with respect to children with disabilities? You can touch upon education, too. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8119831" data-originallang="en">What do you expect the future outcomes to be as we, hopefully, exit this conflict?</p>
