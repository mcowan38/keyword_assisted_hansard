I see an egregious abuse of the speaking order by Mrs. Thomas and other members, rather than getting to the heart of the matter.</p>

There are communities watching right now, watching and waiting to hear an explanation. We have a member of the department here prepared to answer these questions, and if there is a genuine desire for allyship and support for communities to get to the heart of this matter, then there wouldn't be such a gross abuse of time on something that is so sensitive and so important and that has been so painful for so many across this country.</p>
