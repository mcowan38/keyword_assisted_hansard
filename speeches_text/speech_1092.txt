<p data-HoCid="6791855" data-originallang="en">Now, I want to ask a question. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6791856" data-originallang="en">It came to light last fall that anti-Semitic materials were being distributed through UNRWA to Palestinian students in Palestinian schools. At the time, I was encouraged when <a data-HoCid="253393" href="/politicians/karina-gould/" title="Karina Gould">Minister Gould</a> issued a statement saying that she instructed Canadian officials to investigate the references in school materials, in the West Bank and Gaza, that violate UN values of human rights.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791857" data-originallang="en"> I did an OPQ question and the response I got didn't mention anything about an investigation. I asked what the status of the investigation was and who the Canadian officials were who were involved in this investigation, and there was no information with respect to that. I'm wondering if maybe they left it out and that you could enlighten us as to what the nature and status of the investigation is.</p>
