<p data-HoCid="8412231" data-originallang="en"> You can characterize this however you want, Chair, but you can read back the comments in Hansard. We are talking about racism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia. It's all in here, and that's what I'm talking about.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412232" data-originallang="en">Quite frankly, I think my comments are constructive, and I would actually welcome the conversation of whether we should include directly, in this proposed study, Islamophobia, because I believe that to be a scourge. Certainly, in talking to many of my Muslim friends, they have also commented to me that they don't necessarily feel safe.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412233" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Noormohamed, in this very committee, recounted his own experience growing up that he often felt like he was judged just because of his faith. I don't think anyone should live that, and I think that including it specifically within this study is absolutely critical.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412234" data-originallang="en">Getting back to my original point, though, which is what I was going to get to, is I have heard <a data-HoCid="278567" href="/politicians/marco-mendicino/" title="Marco Mendicino">Mr. Mendicino</a>, <a data-HoCid="299805" href="/politicians/ben-carr/" title="Ben Carr">Mr. Carr</a>, <a data-HoCid="278383" href="/politicians/anthony-housefather/" title="Anthony Housefather">Mr. Housefather</a>, amongst many other Liberals talk about the scourge that is anti-Semitism. Of course, I've heard Conservatives call it out, including <a data-HoCid="278781" href="/politicians/marty-morantz/" title="Marty Morantz">Mr. Morantz</a>,<a data-HoCid="278731" href="/politicians/melissa-lantsman/" title="Melissa Lantsman">Ms. Lantsman</a> and our leader, <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">Mr. Poilievre</a>. However, I think, if we're going to have a four-meeting study on this, that we do understand some of the background.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412235" data-originallang="en"> I do want to add a little bit of context with respect to anti-Semitism in Canada. Canada actually has the fourth-largest Jewish community in the world, with over 390,000 Jews. Many of the folks I know of Jewish heritage or Jewish religion, however you wish to characterize it, have direct roots to the Holocaust. I myself am actually of part Jewish heritage as well, on my grandmother's side. When you hear the stories of the Holocaust survivors and how the storm that eventually came to be the Holocaust in Germany arose, they are horrific. Others might question why I want to include anti-Semitism in this study, but I think it's critically important.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412236" data-originallang="en">Here's just a brief look into the world of folks of Jewish heritage. Here is what has happened in very recent history: vandalism, graffiti, circulation of hate propaganda, intolerant and racist language in places like Twitter, and comments on web forums and blogs. There have been bomb threats against Jewish schools and community centres, including not very far from where we are. We've heard of the intimidation of Jewish students even on our university campuses, which are there to be places of safety and of growth; and yet our Jewish students often, unfortunately, feel unsafe.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412237" data-originallang="en"> I'll continue here. There has been significant progress, and I would hate to see that reversed, as the last six months, since October 7, have been extremely challenging for our country. We've seen a rise of both Islamophobia and anti-Semitism. I think that needs to be, quite frankly, a focus of the study, if we want to study hate in our country. For example, policeâ€”</p>
