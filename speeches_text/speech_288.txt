<p data-HoCid="6269073" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to join my colleagues in tabling a petition with respect to the horrific crimes happening in East Turkestan. This is what one expert, Adrian Zenz, has called the largest mass detention of a minority community since the Holocaust, and it is time we act to deliver on the promise of “never again”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6269074" data-originallang="en">I thank members of communities across Canada that have been active in mobilizing public response and signing petitions. This petition calls for the recognition of the gross violations of human rights against the Uighurs as an act of genocide. The petitioners also call for the use of the Magnitsky act against those involved in these abuses.</p>
