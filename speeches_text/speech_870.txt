<p data-HoCid="6692135" data-originallang="en">Minister, I'll take the floor first and then give you the remaining time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6692136" data-originallang="en">I want to be very clear that the content I read is from supplementary materials produced by UNRWA. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6692137" data-originallang="en">UNRWA uses Palestinian Authority produced textbooks; however, UNRWA also produces supplementary materials. The quotation I read is not from Palestinian Authority materials. Palestinian Authority materials make no reference to the Abraham accords. The quotation I read is from materials produced by UNRWA.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6692138" data-originallang="en">I'll pass the floor over to you.</p>
