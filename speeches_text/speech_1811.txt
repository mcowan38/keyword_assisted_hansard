<p data-HoCid="7265008" data-originallang="en">Just to follow up on Mr. Israel, I would say I agree that, when we're talking about a new technology, particularly one with as many flaws as facial recognition, the onus has to be on law enforcement. In this case we know the flaws. Multiple studies have shown the disproportionate error rates and the consequential impacts on people's lives. There have been a few high-profile instances in the United States of Black men being falsely arrested by facial recognition match and the devastating consequences for people because of that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7265009" data-originallang="en">At the very least, do extensive study to show that those flaws and error rates have been eliminated and that there aren't disproportionate impacts on people based on demographics. That's just not there now. In the absence of that, essentially the widespread use of facial recognition technology in these specific contexts is running an experiment on the population at large. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7265010" data-originallang="en">We're not there yet, but certainly, looking forward I'd also agree that the concerns about persistent tracking and identity theft, all of those exist. Any balance that this committee strikes in its recommendations has to take into account the harms that will result even if the technology functions as it's claimed to function.</p>
