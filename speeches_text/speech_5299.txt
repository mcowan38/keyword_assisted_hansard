<p data-HoCid="8693773" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693774" data-originallang="fr">I'd like to thank the witnesses for being with us and for enlightening us with their comments.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693775" data-originallang="fr">I think some of you have responded to the argument that others are trying to make, that the lack of support for the two-state solution in both Palestine and Israel should prevent the recognition of the state of Palestine by the Government of Canada. What we understand from your testimony is that, on the contrary, Canada's recognition of Palestine could increase support for the two-state solution in both Palestine and Israel. I think that offers a great deal of hope. So this argument is in favour of such recognition.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693776" data-originallang="fr">As our colleague Ms. Fry pointed out earlier, the purpose of our study isn't so much to determine whether it's appropriate to recognize Palestine, but rather to determine when it should be recognized.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693777" data-originallang="fr">My colleague Ms. McPherson often repeats that the government could immediately recognize Palestine, so much so that some see the process we are currently engaged in as a kind of ultimate delay, a dilatory measure designed to postpone what should be done now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693778" data-originallang="fr">My question is for all three witnesses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693779" data-originallang="fr">The government says it is waiting for the right time, but it has never defined the right time to recognize Palestine. Do you think the time is right?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693780" data-originallang="fr">Let's start with Mr. Larson, who hasn't had a chance to answer any questions yet.</p>
