<p data-HoCid="8479403" data-originallang="en">I mentioned that one of the forms of Islamophobia comes from white supremacism, a belief in the great replacement theory. The Islamophobia that comes from that goes hand in hand with anti-Semitism. I quoted one of the inspirations of the perpetrator of my family's killing. He was inspired by New Zealand. He was inspired by California. The terrorist in California, when he wasn't able to set fire to the mosque, shot people in a synagogue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479404" data-originallang="en">You can certainly draw a chain of killersâ€”even in Buffalo, New York, which happened in 2022; in El Paso, Texas; and at the Pittsburgh synagogue. The great replacement theory, the echo chambers that people fall into and the rabbit holes people go down are real things, so addressing them would address many types of hate at the same time. However, doing that wouldn't provide a complete solution.</p>
