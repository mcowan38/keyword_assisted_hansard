<p data-HoCid="7733108" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, at moments like this, when we hear the stories of the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> in this place, we realize how much we are of one mind. When I look at the report of the inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people, I recognize there are things in there that we need to do, but we have not acted on those recommendations. However, this notion of a Red Dress Day is a way to be able to say that we are putting out an emergency and that we will protect the lives of our friends as forcefully as we can so that the carnage and the genocide stop.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7733109" data-originallang="en">I want to thank my friend from Elgin—Middlesex—London for being open-hearted and committed to the lives of women.</p>
