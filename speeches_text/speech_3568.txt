<p data-HoCid="8291328" data-originallang="en">—resolution to this. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8291329" data-originallang="en">I'm going to make a couple of quick comments, and then I think it would be advisable to move to suspend, if the committee thinks that is fair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8291330" data-originallang="en">I would like to put this briefly on the record: We are in a precarious time, a time I have never seen in my 45 years on this earth and in Canada. We have forces of anti-Semitism—and I might say as well Islamophobia—that are really ripping at the very fabric of our country right now. We have a government that is putting out legislation that professes to fight this hatred but that in reality, regardless of whether we're talking about Canadian Heritage or otherwise, is funding this hatred. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8291331" data-originallang="en">I think it behooves all of us—not just as members of the Liberals or Conservatives or Bloc or NDP, but as Canadians—to get to the bottom of this. This is not a resolution about condemning but about exploring, so I think it's very reasonable to study this in order to understand this situation, and I think we should do it promptly, because we don't have much time. As a committee and as a country, we need to show that we are fervently against anti-Semitism in all of its forms.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8291332" data-originallang="en">With that, I would move to suspend so that we can move forward, hopefully in a quick way, to begin this study and to get to the bottom of this.</p>
