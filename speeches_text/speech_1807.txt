<p data-HoCid="7264952" data-originallang="en">Welcome to meeting number 27 of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics. Pursuant to Standing Order 108(3)(h) and the motion adopted by the committee on Monday, December 13, 2021, the committee is resuming its study of the use and impact of facial recognition technology.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7264953" data-originallang="en">I would like to now welcome our witnesses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7264954" data-originallang="en"> From the American Civil Liberties Union, we have Esha Bhandari. From the Samuelson-Glushko Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic, we have Tamir Israel, staff lawyer.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7264955" data-originallang="en">I apologize for the late start. It was just a function once again—and not uncommon at this time of the year—of the timing of votes in the House of Commons. The meeting was scheduled for one hour, from 3:30 to 4:30. We will still go ahead for the full hour, starting now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7264956" data-originallang="en">With that, I will ask Ms. Bhandari to begin.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7264957" data-originallang="en"> You have the floor for up to five minutes.</p>
