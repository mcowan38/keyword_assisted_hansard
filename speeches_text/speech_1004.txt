<p data-HoCid="6721373" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6721374" data-originallang="en">Thank you to all the witnesses today for their extremely compelling and powerful testimony.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6721375" data-originallang="en">Sean, it's okay to cry, man, because I cry all the time. This is an emotional thing for all of us sitting on this committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6721376" data-originallang="en">I want to pick up on Ms. Blaney's theme about youth. I was critic for Veterans Affairs during Vimy 100. I went there. I also went to Beaumont-Hamel. It's unbelievable the sacrifices that the Royal Newfoundlanders made. Of course, with regard to Vimy, we all know the story there.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6721377" data-originallang="en">It really was a life-altering experience; there's no other way to describe it. Many people who were on that trip as part of the delegation felt the same way. I said in the House at the time that, just as many pilgrimage sites exist for religious or other circumstances, whether it's the Taj Mahal or the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem, I think Vimy should be Canada's pilgrimage site for young students.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6721378" data-originallang="en">I know there's a lot of engagement within high schools across the country. There were thousands and thousands of students were there. I ask, “How can we do that better?” because I think it's that important.</p>
