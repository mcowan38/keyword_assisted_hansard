<p data-HoCid="8643238" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, of course, we continue to unequivocally condemn the brutal terrorist attacks perpetrated by Hamas on October 7, 2023. Canada also continues to support Israel's right to defend itself in accordance with international humanitarian law.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8643239" data-originallang="fr">The allegations that UNRWA staff participated in the October 7 attacks were troubling. Following these allegations, the UNRWA immediately and proactively dismissed the employees who were named and co-operated fully with the investigation and review called for by the UN Secretary-General. The UNRWA has also continued to strengthen its neutrality mechanisms.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8643240" data-originallang="en">On March 8, 2024, Canada announced that it would resume funding to UNRWA. This decision was taken in light of the serious and significant reviews under way and the steps undertaken by UNRWA to address allegations and reinforce its neutrality mechanisms. Canada had seen the interim report of the investigation being done by the United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services and was satisfied that there was no significant obstacle to resuming aid as the named employees were no longer work for the agency. Other donors also came to this conclusion shortly thereafter and resumed funding to UNRWA before the ongoing review and study were finished. When resuming funding, Canada and other donors also considered the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza and the significant need for increased assistance. It is also important to recall that UNRWA provides up to 60% of all humanitarian assistance in Gaza, and its systems are essential for delivery of aid by other partners. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8643241" data-originallang="en">Reports that UNRWA is requesting that its employees be shielded from persecution by invoking their diplomatic immunity are false. These media reports conflate the initial investigation into the alleged participation of UNRWA staff in the October 7 attacks with a lawsuit filed in the United States against UNRWA and some of its senior officials.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8643242" data-originallang="en"> We are aware that an UNRWA staff member was reportedly killed in an Israeli air strike in Lebanon on Monday, September 30. At the time of his death, the UNRWA employee had been on administrative leave without pay since March, following allegations that he had links to Hamas. The employee denied being a member of Hamas, but was nevertheless being investigated by UNRWA's internal investigation unit at the time of his death. Detractors incorrectly asserted the employee was subsequently reinstated.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8643243" data-originallang="en">UNRWA reports that throughout the investigation, the employee denied his affiliation to Hamas. The first time that UNRWA received confirmation of his role in Hamas was on Monday, September 30, 2024, when it was confirmed by Hamas. This case underscores UNRWA's diligence in responding to information about alleged activities by staff that are incompatible with their role as UN employees. We acknowledge the other UNRWA employees who have been killed in this crisis and are concerned about the continuing attacks against UNRWA personnel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8643244" data-originallang="fr">The work of UN agencies and trusted humanitarian actors in Gaza is fundamental to ensuring that the large number of civilians in need receive aid. Canada continues to be a major funding provider for trusted humanitarian organizations so that they can carry out their important work.</p>
