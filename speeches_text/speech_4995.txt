<p data-HoCid="8628314" data-originallang="en"> I absolutely condemn such acts of anti-Semitism and acts of hate that we have seen across this country. They need to stopâ€”full stop.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8628315" data-originallang="en">We condemn them in the strongest terms possible. We're working really closely with our colleagues at Public Safety. The local jurisdictions are very much engaged on this issue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8628316" data-originallang="en">As I mentioned, we have been very proactive in the work we have been doing. Also, as I mentioned, we have put forward Canada's first ever action plan on combatting hate. This came out of the work we have been doing with community members and working alongside stakeholders. This came out of the two summits our government held on combatting anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. This came out of the work my colleague <a data-HoCid="278916" href="/politicians/marci-ien/" title="Marci Ien">Minister Ien</a> has been doing for the action plan for the 2SLGBTQ community.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8628317" data-originallang="en"> The $275 million that we're putting forward is to support communities on the ground in preventing hate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8628318" data-originallang="en"> We're enhancing the Canada community security program, which helps communities on the ground to provide support.</p>
