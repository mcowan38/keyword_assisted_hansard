<p data-HoCid="8714939" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714940" data-originallang="en">Again, thank you for coming before the committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714941" data-originallang="en">It was on a just and lasting peace that I began my questioning at the last session, and I appreciated your articulation of that and Canada's long-standing position and support for the two-state solution.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714942" data-originallang="en">That just and lasting peace must provide dignity and security for all. Would you agree with the statement that for that just and lasting peace to be durable, it must enjoy popular support, both within the State of Israel and within the Palestinian people?</p>
