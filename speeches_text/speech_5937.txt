<p data-HoCid="8805033" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I stand today to advocate for fairness, unity and recognition.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8805034" data-originallang="en">Christianity, embraced by millions of Canadians, has shaped the moral and cultural fabric of our great nation. Many of Canada's foundational values, institutions and traditions reflect Christian principles. We have months dedicated to Sikh, Islamic, Jewish and Hindu heritage, but there is no such recognition for the Christian faith.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8805035" data-originallang="en">December, a month already steeped in Christian traditions of hope and giving, is the perfect time to honour this legacy. Let us celebrate the values, contributions and diversity Christianity has brought to Canada and to mankind. I urge the government to designate December as Christian heritage month.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8805036" data-originallang="en">I wish everyone a merry Christmas and a very happy, healthy and prosperous new year.</p>
