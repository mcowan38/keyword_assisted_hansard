<p data-HoCid="8024866" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8024867" data-originallang="en"> It's good to see you in the chair, Mr. Moore.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8024868" data-originallang="en"> Hello, colleagues. I hope you're all well. At the outset, I want to say thank you for the quick work on Bill <a data-HoCid="12367527" href="/bills/44-1/S-12/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code, the Sex Offender Information Registration Act and the International Transfer of Offenders Act">S-12</a> and making sure that we met a court deadline and maintain the sex offender registry going forward.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8024869" data-originallang="fr">Thank you very much for inviting me to speak to you about Bill <a data-HoCid="12237277" href="/bills/44-1/C-40/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code, to make consequential amendments to other Acts and to repeal a regulation (miscarriage of justice reviews)">C‑40, Miscarriage of Justice Review Commission Act (David and Joyce Milgaard's Law)</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8024870" data-originallang="en">Bill C-40 proposes necessary and long overdue change to our criminal justice system, and it will indeed change lives. I'm grateful for the important work of my predecessor David Lametti in developing Bill <a data-HoCid="12237277" href="/bills/44-1/C-40/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code, to make consequential amendments to other Acts and to repeal a regulation (miscarriage of justice reviews)">C-40</a>. I have every intention of fulfilling the promise that <a data-HoCid="278544" href="/politicians/david-lametti/" title="David Lametti">David Lametti</a> made to David Milgaard and his mother Joyce to pass this important legislation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8024871" data-originallang="en">I think we all, as parliamentarians, owe it to those people who have been wrongfully convicted, like David Milgaard and others. These errors cost them their freedom, their livelihood, their reputation and their time with loved ones. The errors are devastating to victims of crime and to their families.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8024872" data-originallang="en">This bill responds to long-standing calls from wrongfully convicted Canadians and their advocates. This issue has been studied extensively. Over decades, numerous commissions of inquiry have delivered one consistent recommendation to government: the creation of an independent commission dedicated to the review and investigation of cases when a miscarriage of justice that may have occurred is warranted.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8024873" data-originallang="en"> Other countries have done this already, so we're not charting new territory here. Independent criminal case review commissions have been established in the jurisdictions of England, Wales and Northern Ireland; in the jurisdiction of Scotland; and in the jurisdiction of New Zealand.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8024874" data-originallang="en">Bill <a data-HoCid="12237277" href="/bills/44-1/C-40/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code, to make consequential amendments to other Acts and to repeal a regulation (miscarriage of justice reviews)">C-40</a> is shaped by a broad public consultation process that took place during summer 2021, involving more than 200 individuals and groups with experience and expertise in the area of criminal justice. That process was followed by further consultations with the provinces and territories, judicial organizations, national indigenous organizations, organizations from Black and other equity-seeking communities, and various bar associations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8024875" data-originallang="en">One of the key findings of the consultations is that commissions in other countries are able to process applications far faster than in Canada's current system. This means that countries with an independent commission have fewer people spending time behind bars for crimes they didn't commit. That in and of itself is incredibly significant.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8024876" data-originallang="en">In Canada, our wrongful conviction regime was last amended in 2002.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8024877" data-originallang="en"> I'll just note parenthetically that this power has existed in one shape or form in the hands of people, who were my predecessors going back to 1892. We're talking about a change to the executive prerogative in this area that dates back to the time when the first Stanley Cup was awarded over 100 years ago. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8024878" data-originallang="en">Since 2002—I was just referencing the last time this was amended—just over 200 applications for review have been submitted. You've heard Ms. Gazan mention that there have only been 26 successful referrals back to the courts through the ministerial review process. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8024879" data-originallang="en">Let's compare that for a moment with a country that has an independent commission. The United Kingdom is a great comparator. They have referred 822 cases in the same time period, with 559 appeals successfully overturned. With a population that is just about half of the U.K.'s, I think that contrast is very powerful. Further, I would note that in all but five of the 26 successful Canadian applications that Ms. Gazan mentioned, the individuals were white and not racialized. In every single one of the 26 successful applications the individuals were male.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8024880" data-originallang="en">That bears no resemblance whatsoever to our prison populations. Black and indigenous persons, who we all know are overrepresented in our criminal justice system, need equal access to this process, as do women. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8024881" data-originallang="fr">An independent commission devoted exclusively to reviewing potential miscarriages of justice will both increase trust in the review process and improve access to justice by facilitating and accelerating the review of applications from persons who may have been wrongfully convicted.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8024882" data-originallang="fr">A commission with five to nine full-time or part-time commissioners, in addition to staff, will be able to review applications more quickly. Recommendations for the appointment of commissioners will have to reflect the diversity of Canadian society and also consider gender equality and the overrepresentation of certain groups in the criminal justice system, specifically indigenous and Black individuals.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8024883" data-originallang="en">The bill requires the commission to deal with applications as expeditiously as possible—this was mentioned by Ms. Besner—to provide regular status updates, and to provide notice to the parties, as well as to provide them with a reasonable period of time in which to respond. The bill also requires the commission be accessible and transparent. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8024884" data-originallang="en"> It will adopt and publish on its website procedural policies to guide its work. It will have a dedicated victim services coordinator to support victims and assist with the development of procedural policies, especially as they relate to victim notification and participation. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8024885" data-originallang="en">These are essential measures to facilitate the proper support for victims, which I know is a keen concern of yours, Mr. Chair, in terms of the work you and I did on this committee previously. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8024886" data-originallang="en">I think it's important to understand that, obviously, victims can be doubly traumatized by the notion of a miscarriage of justice having occurred and the fact that the actual perpetrator of the crime against their families remains at large.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8024887" data-originallang="en">To help address systemic issues and prevent miscarriages of justice from occurring, the bill directs the commission to carry out outreach activities, such as the ones I mentioned to Ms. Gazan; provide information about its mandate on the miscarriage of justice to the public and potential applicants; and publish its decisions. Commission staff will be empowered to provide applicants with information guidance. The commission will be able to provide reintegration supports to applicants in need. The commission will be able to provide applicants with translation and interpretation services, and to help applicants obtain legal assistance and the necessities of life, such as housing and medical care. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8024888" data-originallang="en">All of these elements are essential. A commission that conducts outreach and assists with applications recognizes the systemic barriers faced by applicants in the current system. It is in everyone's best interest that wrongful convictions be remedied. Indeed, I would posit that there isn't a single one of us, among the 338 occupying the House of Commons, who would advocate for a wrong conviction in any context. Therefore, the proactive nature of Bill <a data-HoCid="12237277" href="/bills/44-1/C-40/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code, to make consequential amendments to other Acts and to repeal a regulation (miscarriage of justice reviews)">C‑40</a>'s commission will ensure that no applicant is excluded from accessing this process because of a lack of resources or the inability to apply.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8024889" data-originallang="en">My officials have been briefing you on the technical changes this law reform proposes, but there are a couple that I would like to highlight in particular.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8024890" data-originallang="en">One is with respect to investigative powers. The commission will have the same powers of investigation as I do as Minister of Justice under the existing regime. These powers are found in part I of the Inquiries Act and can be used to compel the production of information or evidence relevant to an application, and to examine witnesses under oath. These authorities will ensure the commission can gather the information it needs to complete a thorough case review. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8024891" data-originallang="en">The second change I want to highlight is this: Bill <a data-HoCid="12237277" href="/bills/44-1/C-40/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code, to make consequential amendments to other Acts and to repeal a regulation (miscarriage of justice reviews)">C‑40</a> will modify the threshold to proceed with carrying out an investigation. Similar to the existing regime, the commission will be able to conduct an investigation if there are reasonable grounds to believe a miscarriage of justice may have occurred. The commission will also be able to conduct an investigation if it considers that it is in the interest of justice to do so. This is the precise approach used in Scotland and New Zealand. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8024892" data-originallang="en">With respect to the final decision—not the investigation entry point, but the final decision—Bill <a data-HoCid="12237277" href="/bills/44-1/C-40/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code, to make consequential amendments to other Acts and to repeal a regulation (miscarriage of justice reviews)">C‑40</a> introduces a new test. The commission will be able to refer matter to the relevant court of appeal, either for a new appeal or to direct a new trial or hearing when there are reasonable grounds to conclude a miscarriage of justice may have occurred, when the test is conjunctive, and when it is in the interest of justice to do so. It is a test with two criteria, not one. This test replaces the current standard, which is that a miscarriage of justice likely occurred.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8024893" data-originallang="en">If the proposed new legal test is not met, the commission must dismiss the application. The remedies in the bill are the same as those currently available in the existing process: a referral for a new appeal or a direction for a new trial or hearing. The commission will not have the power to quash a conviction or determine the issue of guilt. Those are decisions that will always remain with the courts.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8024894" data-originallang="fr">Bill <a data-HoCid="12237277" href="/bills/44-1/C-40/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code, to make consequential amendments to other Acts and to repeal a regulation (miscarriage of justice reviews)">C‑40</a> sets out the factors the commission will have to consider in making its decisions. The factors currently stipulated in the Criminal Code that relate to the administration of justice are reproduced in Bill <a data-HoCid="12237277" href="/bills/44-1/C-40/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code, to make consequential amendments to other Acts and to repeal a regulation (miscarriage of justice reviews)">C‑40</a>, and two new factors are added relating to the particular circumstances of applicants. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8024895" data-originallang="en">That is, it's specifically looking at the personal circumstances of the applicant and distinct challenges they may have faced, with particular attention to the circumstances of Black and indigenous accused. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8024896" data-originallang="en">I believe firmly in our justice system. Its quality is the best in the world. However, we also know that miscarriages of justice occur. Often they are only discovered long after the criminal court process has concluded. These experiences erode the public's trust in a justice system that is meant to protect them. This bill is a significant step forward in restoring that trust and confidence in the system. It is named after David Milgaard, who spent 23 years of his life serving time for a crime he did not commit, and for his mother, Joyce, who never gave up the fight for his freedom. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8024897" data-originallang="en"> Bill <a data-HoCid="12237277" href="/bills/44-1/C-40/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code, to make consequential amendments to other Acts and to repeal a regulation (miscarriage of justice reviews)">C-40</a> honours David and Joyce's legacy by creating a system that will lead to more exonerations of the innocent.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8024898" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
