<p data-HoCid="6027019" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, last week Governor General Julie Payette was in Jerusalem with a delegation of members from all parties in the House of Commons. At Yad Vashem, world leaders came together in the state of Israel to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz and International Holocaust Remembrance Day. Today, the Governor General and the delegation are at Auschwitz for another commemoration.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6027020" data-originallang="fr">In a world grappling with a rise in anti-Semitism and hate, our leaders gathered to honour the memory of the approximately six million Jews and millions of others who were murdered by the Nazis and their collaborators.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6027021" data-originallang="en">In Canada, I am pleased we have adopted the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism, but we know there is much more we need to do to confront one of the world's oldest evils. I ask all members of the House to join me in commemorating those killed in the Holocaust, honouring the survivors and loudly and clearly saying, “never again”.</p>
