<p data-HoCid="6382738" data-originallang="en">The status of statehood is an important element in the global response to COVID-19. We've seen this recently at the World Health Organization regarding the status of Taiwan's participation in the World Health Organization. We know that the Palestinians are not full members of the WHO, and we've also seen recently Canada oppose a resolution at the WHO that singled out Israel for different treatment. It's in that context that I would like to ask you about today's vote at the United Nations and your subsequent speech.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6382739" data-originallang="en">You mentioned in your speech that you do not agree with some of the elements of the preamble to the resolution that was voted on. What particular elements do you not support?</p>
