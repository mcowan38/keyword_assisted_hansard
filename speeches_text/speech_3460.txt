<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, everyone in this country has the right to live their life free from fear of attack or abuse because of who they are as an individual. Hatred that targets people based on race, faith, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, disability or any other personal characteristic is counter to Canadian values. Everyone in Canada deserves a safe space to be themselves and to thrive. Unfortunately, hate, intolerance and racism, and particularly anti-Semitism, exists in many ugly and dangerous forms throughout Canadian society and the world. </p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Our government is taking action to combat this issue. For example, in the fall, the <a data-HoCid="300017" href="/politicians/dominic-leblanc/" title="Dominic LeBlanc">Minister of Public Safety</a> announced enhancements to the security infrastructure program, which will help all communities that are understandably concerned for their safety to better prepare for and discourage any potential acts of violence. The minister announced an additional $5 million for this program in light of the rising hate we are seeing in this country. I think this is an important investment. I will give the member a personal example. The <a data-HoCid="299996" href="/politicians/arif-virani/" title="Arif Virani">justice minister</a> and I attended the Bosnian Islamic Centre in my own riding to discuss some of the funding it received through this program for security purposes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">I also want to mention the upcoming online safety legislation from the <a data-HoCid="299996" href="/politicians/arif-virani/" title="Arif Virani">Minister of Justice</a>. Hate exists in many forms, including online, and we want to combat hate in all its forms. I am looking forward to this legislation being tabled. </p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">I have no doubt that for many in the Jewish community, recent events have undermined their faith in what Canada stands for. I want to assure them that I, the <a data-HoCid="299996" href="/politicians/arif-virani/" title="Arif Virani">Minister of Justice</a> and our government stand firmly opposed to anti-Semitism and hate in all its forms. We will continue to work to combat it.</p>
