<p data-HoCid="8455915" data-originallang="en">I thank the witnesses for being here today, but I have to say I find it a bit distressing that your testimony doesn't seem to match the reality that I hear from students on campus. They're not just at your institutions, but at institutions in my own riding and across the country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455916" data-originallang="en"> One of the problems is that while it's great to say anti-Semitism is unacceptable and a Jew should be included in diversity, I don't actually see that in the policies I've been able to access.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455917" data-originallang="en"> I'm going to start with Professor Gertler from U of T. Where in your anti-harassment policies or anywhere else in your policies does it explicitly say anti-Semitism is not acceptable on campus?</p>
