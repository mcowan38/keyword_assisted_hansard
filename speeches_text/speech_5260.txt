<p data-HoCid="8693539" data-originallang="en">Considerations of international law and the promotion of Canada's stated interest in democracy and peace demonstrate that the recognition of a Palestinian state would be a grave mistake for Canada. It is completely understandable that many members of this House and this committee feel that more should be done to show solidarity with the Palestinian people, but recognition is not it. It does nothing for the Palestinian people, while rewarding their most criminal leaders.</p>
