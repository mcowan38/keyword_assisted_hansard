<p data-HoCid="6719615" data-originallang="en">Yes. There were two problems early on that we noticed back in December. Two groups were highly vaccine hesitant. One was black and brown communities, and then conservative groups. There were four news polls, one from PBS NewsHour and others from Monmouth University, Quinnipiac University and Kaiser showing that about 40% to 50% of Republicans said they would refuse vaccinations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6719616" data-originallang="en">So I started doing two things. One, I began going on a radio podcast and a radio program that reached black and brown communities, and hesitancy really started going down. I was on one very interesting one with one of the historic black churches in Richmond, Virginia. A pediatrician from the church invited me together with the pastor. I said to the pastor that the numbers looked like they were going down. What did he attribute that to? He said that part of it was that doctors like me were reaching out but also that the clergy in black churches really work together to help make that happen. I think he's right. I think that made a big difference. But now the problem is more access in low-income communities than hesitancy. However, with the conservative groups, it still a rip-roaring problem. You're seeing it reflected now in this disparity between blue and deep red states. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6719617" data-originallang="en">My fear is that we're going to reach some of those benchmarks in the blue or blueish states and the Democratic strongholdsâ€”and that's already starting to happen. We're already reaching numbers that will look like Israel's numbers, but in the deep red states, we're still greatly underperforming and underachieving. I worry about ongoing virus transmission there. We have to do a better job reaching out to conservative groups. I'm trying to go back on Newsmax and Fox News and stations like that to do what I can. But it's been really tough. </p>
