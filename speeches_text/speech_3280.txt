<p data-HoCid="8122376" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8122377" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Minister, for appearing before the committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8122378" data-originallang="en">Minister, I know we all have been deeply moved and concerned by the humanitarian crisis happening in Gaza right now. I know that your colleagues at Global Affairs are working hard to allow all Canadians, permanent residents and their immediate families to leave Gaza. Of course, it is not up to us, but the local authorities on when and how Canadians can leave.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8122379" data-originallang="en">This has raised an issue we often deal with in immigration—the definition of “immediate family”. In the Canadian and IRCC context, it means a spouse and dependant children under the age of 22. In my own culture, and, frankly, most others outside the U.S., it is much broader and includes siblings and grandparents.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8122380" data-originallang="en">Right now, Canada is not helping these people leave Gaza, other than the immediate family members. I've heard from grandparents whose grandchildren have lost their parents and they have no one to take care of them. People have siblings there who have no one else there. They want to come to Canada to be cared for and be with their families.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8122381" data-originallang="en">Will you take this opportunity to redefine the definition of “immediate family”, and help more people with strong ties to reach Canada safely?</p>
