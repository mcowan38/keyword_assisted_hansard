<p data-HoCid="7014190" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Mohammed Alzaza, at age 15, suffered from serious injuries as a result of a drone strike in Gaza. Though he survived, he suffered from serious injuries, but he's managed to make his way to Turkey seeking asylum. A Vancouver East church group submitted a private sponsorship application in January 2021, and they were approved. Given Mohammed's health condition—and his mental health, by the way, is deteriorating rapidly—will the minister look into expediting this urgent application?</p>
