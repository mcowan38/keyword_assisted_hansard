<p data-HoCid="7957647" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, I want to send my heartfelt sympathy to my colleague. As a Jewish Canadian, I know he is experiencing such incredible heartbreak right now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957648" data-originallang="en">While I am not Jewish, I empathize with every Jewish Canadian and with Jewish people around the world for the horrific things that have happened in Israel over the last several days. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7957649" data-originallang="en">Because I am not Jewish, I am going to quote from somebody who is a survivor of the massacre at the Kibbutz Be'eri, who asked, “How am I supposed to wake up every morning and know that 4.5 kilometres from me, from my home in Kibbutz Be'eri, in Gaza there are people for whom this is not over? If you hear my words, look deep, deep inside and ask yourselves what your values are. I know what I want. I want a just peace.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957650" data-originallang="en">Do the children in Gaza not deserve the same peace that we are all hoping for, for the Israeli people?</p>
