<p data-HoCid="7654541" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, my friend, actor, director and producer Louisette Dussault took her final bow and left us last week. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7654542" data-originallang="fr"> In addition to her multiple roles and productions, she was active as the president of the Conseil québécois du théâtre and worked for the Commission internationale du théâtre francophone. She contributed to the success of great Quebec works such as <em>Les belles-sœurs</em> and <em>Demain matin, Montréal m'attend</em> by the great Michel Tremblay.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7654543" data-originallang="fr"> Devoted to Quebec, she was part of the women for sovereignty bus. I remember her magnificent interpretation of <em>Panis Angelicus</em>, which she dedicated to me and sang in her beautiful soprano voice when she sponsored the island collective project Les Marsouineries de L'Isle-aux-Coudres.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7654544" data-originallang="fr">What about the 750 episodes of <em>La souris verte</em> that won the hearts of children in Quebec? For six decades we have been singing: <span class="verse">Ten sheep<br>Nine sparrows <br>Eight groundhogs<br>Seven rabbits<br>Six ducks <br>Five ants<br>Four cats<br>And three chicks<br>Two weasels and one mouse.<br>[We love our] green mouse.<br></span></p>
