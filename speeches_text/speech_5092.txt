<p data-HoCid="8628570" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8628571" data-originallang="en">Thank you to the department officials and the minister.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8628572" data-originallang="en">According to Canada's new anti-racism strategy, the special envoy on preserving Holocaust remembrance and combatting anti-Semitism has both an “international” and a “domestic” role.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8628573" data-originallang="en">You may be aware, Minister, that I had the original PMB, Bill <a data-HoCid="11535416" href="/bills/44-1/C-250/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (prohibition — promotion of antisemitism)">C-250</a>. It proposed massive penalties for the promotion of anti-Semitism, but in the wisdom of your government, you decided to take my bill.... Bill C‑250 had teeth. It was strong. You have weakened this bill. When I look at what your government has done and not done compared to what my bill would have done, it's night and day.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8628574" data-originallang="en"> I'm a little concerned when you start taking bills at budget time, putting them in...and then not following up, because my Bill <a data-HoCid="11535416" href="/bills/44-1/C-250/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (prohibition — promotion of antisemitism)">C-250</a> had major consequences. I don't see any consequences in the proposed bill, in what you have taken today. I want to know why you haven't followed up on some of my recommendations in Bill C‑250.</p>
