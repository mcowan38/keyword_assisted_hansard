<p data-HoCid="8100291" data-originallang="en">It was because I accidentally called you “Madam Speaker”. I should say that I reserve the right to change my mind down the road, depending on how things go.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100292" data-originallang="en"> On the motion, I just want to quickly say that, obviously, Canada is our common home. We're very blessed. It's a place where people from all over the world come to live and pursue their dreams. Canada is a free country, but as we often take note at Remembrance Day, freedom is not free, and we have to be constantly vigilant.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100293" data-originallang="en">We defend these values. We need to protect the freedom of all Canadians and stand for the values of freedom all around the world. Too often now in Canada—we're seeing them around the world but we're also seeing them in our home—we see disturbing acts of hatred and discrimination. Those acts threaten these values. These incidents can include verbal abuse, vandalism, hate, intimidation and violent acts. These acts must never stand in our country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100294" data-originallang="en">In recent years, we've seen a community face intimidations and threats by nefarious foreign actors. We've seen Jewish schools shot at and synagogues firebombed. We've seen churches burned down. We've seen Sikhs face harassment and discrimination. We've seen innocent Muslims murdered in their places of worship. We've seen Hindu temples vandalized.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100295" data-originallang="en">These shameful acts have one goal, to terrorize Canadians. This cannot be tolerated. All Canadians must be able to freely live their lives and follow their dreams without fear and intimidation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100296" data-originallang="en">The <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> has to take action to stop this surge in hatred. That is why I moved this five-part motion. I think they are common sense, and others may wish to speak to them. It's certainly not exhaustive, but it's a five-part motion that I think would have a tangible effect.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100297" data-originallang="en">As we sit here as parliamentarians in Canada, we have to look, with some degree of concern, when we have the United Kingdom, for example, issuing advisories and they're news to us. We need to have a government that is on top of that. We need to be on top of that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100298" data-originallang="en">With the influence that we see now of foreign actors, we need to have a foreign influence registry. There's no doubt that the IRGC has to be listed as a terrorist entity.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100299" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, that is why I have moved this motion. Thank you for providing the time for me to speak to it today.</p>
