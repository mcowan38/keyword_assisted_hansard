<p data-HoCid="8703173" data-originallang="en">Unfortunately, Oslo was supposed to be a temporary period of about five years, after which there would be final negotiations and the creation of a separate Palestinian state. Some of the key issues around the status of Jerusalem and the rights of refugees were kind of put on the back burner to be dealt with in the future, which I think was a mistake. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8703174" data-originallang="en">At the time, there were Palestinian voices saying that this too was unfair. Oslo itself was not offering an actual state but an entity minus a state, as Rabin called it. It would not necessarily have given Palestinians actual sovereignty, but regardless of its prospects at the time, clearly, 30 years later, we're stuck in this transitionary period. It has obviously failed. There has to be a new paradigm. Fortunately, the ICJ has given us a new paradigm to take action right now.</p>
