<p data-HoCid="6205662" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, I believe that when Canada provides support to local women's organizations, that is not squandering money. I believe that when Canada provides funding for neonatal care in the Palestinian territories, that is not squandered funding. I believe that when we are engaging on LGBTQ2 issues, when we are engaging on climate change, when we are engaging on human rights around the world, that is not squandering Canadian resources.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6205663" data-originallang="en">I have to sincerely and completely disagree with my hon. colleague. When it comes to defending Israel, when it comes to defending a two-state solution in the Middle East, Canada has been there and has been firm in that commitment. When it comes to defending and seeking justice and transparency for the victims of the Iranian plane crash, Canada has been there.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6205664" data-originallang="en">Canada has not comprised on its values and in fact we continue to lead with them day in and day out.</p>
