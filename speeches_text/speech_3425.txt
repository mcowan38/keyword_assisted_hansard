<p data-HoCid="8198244" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8198245" data-originallang="en">I just want to put this on the public record with respect to the adjournment of the other motion, which I know we passed. Just to be clear, that issue is yet to be dealt with, but I supported it because I want to move a motion with respect to Gaza, which I think is an urgent situation, as peoples' lives are literally at risk minute by minute and second by second. We'll get to that motion when we get to a chance to.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8198246" data-originallang="en">With respect to this motion, there's this perspective or this narrative out there that somehow blames newcomers for Canada's housing crisis. The truth of the matter, in my opinion, is that newcomers are not the people to blame. Rather, it's successive governments, both Liberal and Conservative, that have failed Canadians by not ensuring that there is proper housing for them, housing that they can afford and can have access to. As a result, we have this housing crisis, this escalating housing crisis.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8198247" data-originallang="en">Now, I could go on for days about housing, which I won't. I recognize that this is the immigration committee. However, that said, I do believe that both the <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">Minister of Immigration</a> and the <a data-HoCid="300008" href="/politicians/sean-fraser/" title="Sean Fraser">Minister of Housing</a> should come before the committee on some relevant aspects. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8198248" data-originallang="en">I have another motion about that, and it ties into a number of things.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8198249" data-originallang="en">One is the international students. The crisis that the international students have faced as a result of the fraud scheme that happened and the scam that the students were subject to is a crisis that has not yet been resolved, in my opinion. There are still a lot of problems with respect to that, and a lot of students have not had any communication about their current situation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8198250" data-originallang="en">I also think that the <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">minister</a> made a decision around a cap for international students, and I think that the minister needs to come and talk to the committee about that cap. The minister also announced the increase in financial requirements for international students. I think that this, too, needs to come before the committee so that the minister can talk to committee members about it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8198251" data-originallang="en">The housing issue really ties into the government's role, I think, with the provinces and territories, and with institution, in ensuring that there is a plan for student housing. I want to have that conversation, Mr. Chair, but it has to be cast in the light of talking about the issues rather than blaming newcomers. I have another motion with respect to that, Mr. Chair, which I would like to move at the appropriate time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8198252" data-originallang="en">For those reasons, I will not be supporting the Conservative motion.</p>
