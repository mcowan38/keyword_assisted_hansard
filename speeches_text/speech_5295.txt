<p data-HoCid="8693759" data-originallang="en"> I would premise that the role that Canada can have and has had in the peace process has been, by necessity, quite limited, in the sense that Canada has been able to contribute at different times to the peace process as kind of a holder of the refugee working group on occasion. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693760" data-originallang="en">You mentioned my research. I think this has not necessarily been the priority for Canada. A lot of the priority has been how to place the Middle East policy in the context of alliances. This is why I was suggesting to go back and think about why Canada agreed with this idea of waiting to recognize Palestine. Is there now something that can suggest a departure from that regional position? </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693761" data-originallang="en">It is not unknown for Canada to depart from its previous alliances. It has done so on a number of occasions. Obviously, the dominating factor here is whether the recognition of a Palestinian state could possibly—I'll be quite blunt—hurt our relations with the United States in a context in which the United States does not support that particular step.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693762" data-originallang="en"> I think we are a little bit at a crossroads in deciding what the priorities are and what kind of contribution this kind of recognition would give to the peace process. I do think that at this stage, given the situation on the ground, a recognition of a Palestinian state not coupled with any other initiative to actually further the process will mostly be symbolic and have relatively little impact on the ground. I think there should be a little bit more than just that.</p>
