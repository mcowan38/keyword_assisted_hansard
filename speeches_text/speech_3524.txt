When we look at the permits to Israel in particular, let me be clear: I have not received and therefore have not approved any export permits for weapons to Israel since October 7, 2023, and any permits issued since October 7 were essentially non-lethal equipment permits.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8195459" data-originallang="en">Canada has a very robust export control system. We abide by the UN Arms Trade Treaty and we take this responsibility very seriously.</p>
