<p data-HoCid="8301001" data-originallang="en"> Thank you so much, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301002" data-originallang="en">Thank you to my fellow committee members.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301003" data-originallang="en">The motion I want to put forward is the one we have in front of us:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8301004" data-originallang="en"> That pursuant to Standing Order 108(2) and in view of the alarming escalation of antisemitism in Canada, the committee undertake a study on the issue of antisemitism and the additional measures that could be taken to address the valid fears that are being expressed by Canada's Jewish community. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8301005" data-originallang="en"> That the study include but not be limited to the issue of antisemitism on university campuses. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8301006" data-originallang="en"> That the study should be at least three meetings and that the committee report its findings to the House. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8301007" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, briefly, I had a chance on Monday to deliver a speech in the House that dealt very much with this issue. The Jewish community in Canada is feeling frightened to a level I have never seen. While, anecdotally, people are taking mezuzahs off doors and are afraid to send their kids to school, the vast majority of Jewish Canadians are affected in a broader way. Those are anecdotal, small incidents. I don't think that's happening much. What is happening is people expressing their fears to me and wondering if they're safe in this country and have a future in this country, which I never in my life believed would happen in Canada. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8301008" data-originallang="en">I don't see that anywhere near as much, frankly, when I'm in the United States. Something is happening here. Anti-Semitism is happening around the world, but the perception of the community in Canada is drastically different from what I find south of the border. I think the committee needs to look into what is happening and what we can do. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8301009" data-originallang="en">I'm going to talk about two issues very briefly, which I think are the most poignant and important ones.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301010" data-originallang="en">One of these is the demonstrations happening, and the lack of policing related to those demonstrations. People are blocking buildings, shouting things deemed to be hateful and intimidating people entering or leaving a building, and the police are not moving people back so that there's a safe line that allows for a differentiation between the people trying to enter or leave and the protesters. That's one thing. Why are Jewish buildings a target in Canada, and how is this making people feel? I would like the opportunity to hear from Jewish Canadians and Jewish organizations about how they feel and what they think we could do as federal legislators to better protect them from a public safety aspect, a justice aspect, etc.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301011" data-originallang="en">The second issue is what's on campus. The biggest places where you find people feeling scared and intimidated are campuses. This is happening from Newfoundland to British Columbia. It's happening in my province of Quebec. It's happening in Ontario. It's happening everywhere. Some colleagues and I wrote a letter, in December, to the presidents of the biggest universities in Canada. We have received responses from all of them, which we can table. I think we need to hear from Universities Canada and the presidents of universities on what they're doing to protect Jewish students, and we need to hear from Jewish students regarding what they're experiencing on campus. Then we can opine on what solutions we might be able to recommend to the universities and the minister.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301012" data-originallang="en">That being said, the most important thing is this: Symbolically, the Jewish community has failed to see leadership at the federal, provincial and municipal levelsâ€”from literally everyone. I think, if they see that our committee is interested in this issue, that there is a forum for them and that we are taking their concerns seriously and listening to them, it would be a morale boost because they will think that at least someone cares and there's hope.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301013" data-originallang="en">I'm hoping that my colleagues will agree to do this study. Of course, I'm happy to listen to amendments and yield the floor.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301014" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
