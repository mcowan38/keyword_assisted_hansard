<p data-HoCid="8550425" data-originallang="en"> <em>Uqaqtittiji</em>, I always admire my friend and colleague, the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>, for her vision and great advocacy in ensuring that indigenous peoples' human rights are being upheld, something we do not get to see very often, which we all know is part of the reason we are having this emergency debate. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8550426" data-originallang="en">One of the things that I keep wondering about is what accountability looks like for these people, for the families of these souls we have lost. What will accountability look like for the families of the people the member named in her statement? </p>
