<p data-HoCid="8009974" data-originallang="en"> I want to reassure Canadians that we are in regular contact with Egypt and Israel to push for Canadians to leave as soon as possible. We continually try to reach all Canadians, permanent residents and their immediate family members to convey the latest information.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8009975" data-originallang="en">We continue to call for humanitarian pauses, for Canadians to get out, for aid to get in and for all hostages to be released.</p>
