<p data-HoCid="7963892" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I have the privilege to stand in this House and to use my voice to shine a light or reflect on a moment in time on behalf of my constituents. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7963893" data-originallang="en">I know that over the last weeks, our hearts and souls have been mourning as we are witnessing violence and endless suffering generated by war. I send my love and support to the Muslim and Jewish communities here and abroad that are directly impacted by the events that are unfolding.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7963894" data-originallang="en">Words might appear insignificant at a time when we are collectively facing horror. Words can hurt, but they can also heal. They can change how we perceive the words. We need to see the humanity in one another and not lose sight of everything we have in common. We need to reflect on how we can work with and listen to each other. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7963895" data-originallang="en">Our own country is on a path of reconciliation. Getting there was not easy and is still a constant reaffirmation of our commitment to a better future for all. That is the message I humbly share today. Peace cannot be achieved through violence; it can only be obtained through understanding.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7963896" data-originallang="en">I pray for the world. I pray for peace.</p>
