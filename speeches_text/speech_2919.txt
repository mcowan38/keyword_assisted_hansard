<p data-HoCid="8003731" data-originallang="en">I move that we return to talking about the subamendment. That's where we left off in the previous meeting. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8003732" data-originallang="en">I'm very disappointed, because I think it's clear that the CBC, even after a week and a half, hasn't retracted their story. We saw the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> and the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a>.... All of this disinformation out there suggests Israel bombed the hospital, when in fact the information came from Hamas. I can't believe the committee doesn't want to talk about that and get the CBC to retract their story, </p>
<p data-HoCid="8003733" data-originallang="en">That said, we were talking previously about a similar issue with the CBC. In light of The Canadian Press having to retract three false statements about our Conservative leader this morning, I think this is a timely topic.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8003734" data-originallang="en">We were talking about the subamendment made to Mr. Julian's amendment. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8003735" data-originallang="en">What I will say is this: I think it's important to make sure we have Catherine Tait come to committee for two hours specifically to talk about the issue that was in the same motion today—the false story and the directive about how journalists should not refer to Hamas as terrorists, even though it's legal. We should somehow make sure we distinguish between that and what we're going to talk about with Ms. Tait when she's already scheduled to come, which is her mandate. I have a number of questions to ask about her mandate, because there have been numerous articles that have done a statistical analysis and come to the conclusion that the CBC is left-leaning. In many cases, they are not reporting to Canadians accurately. That is not freedom of the press. It is a very dangerous trend.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8003736" data-originallang="en">In my discussion, I would support very much Mr. Waugh's previous subamendment saying Catherine Tait...“for two hours”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8003737" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
