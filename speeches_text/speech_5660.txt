<p data-HoCid="8720087" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I agree with my colleague that we are wasting a lot of time in the House.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8720088" data-originallang="en">I asked him a question the other day about the international war crimes in Gaza and what the government is going to do. This morning, the ICC indicted Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant for war crimes against humanity. Canada played a huge role in Rwanda with Rom√©o Dallaire and the war crimes there, and also in Srebrenica and Serbia, but now we are seeing nothing from the government.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8720089" data-originallang="en">Now that international war crime indictments are being brought against Benjamin Netanyahu, what will the government do? Will they support full sanctions? Will they support the International Criminal Court? Will they ensure we bring these criminals to the Hague?</p>
