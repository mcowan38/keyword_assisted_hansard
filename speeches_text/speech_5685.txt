<p data-HoCid="8742034" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, today, November 29, marks the UN International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, so I offer to the House, and all Canadians committed to justice and peace, the following reflection:</p>
<p data-HoCid="8742035" data-originallang="en"> <span class="verse"> Every bombed village is my hometown,<br> And every dead child is my child.<br> Every grieving mother is my mother.<br> Every crying father is my father.<br> Every home turned to rubble<br> is the home I grew up in.<br> Every brother carrying the remains<br> of his brother across borders<br> is my brother.<br> Every sister waiting for a sister<br> who will never come home<br> is my sister.<br> </span> <span class="verse"> Every one of these people are ours,<br> Just like we are theirs.<br> We belong to them<br> and they belong to us.<br> </span> </p>
<p data-HoCid="8742036" data-originallang="en">Stop the genocide. Long live Palestine. Long live Gaza.</p>
