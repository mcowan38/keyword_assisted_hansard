<p data-HoCid="8581384" data-originallang="fr">Madam Speaker, I am very honoured to have the opportunity to speak today. I would like to point out that I will be sharing my time with the incredible member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8581385" data-originallang="fr">I cannot help but notice that the Conservative member for <a data-HoCid="278530" href="/politicians/mike-lake/" title="Mike Lake">Edmonton—Wetaskiwin</a>, who just finished his speech, did not answer my question. Nor did he answer the question from the member for <a data-HoCid="278717" href="/politicians/mike-morrice/" title="Mike Morrice">Kitchener Centre</a>, who asked whether the Canada disability benefit would be maintained if, by some misfortune, a Conservative government were elected in the next election.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8581386" data-originallang="fr">If the Conservatives feel it is inadequate, will they enhance it? Will they maintain pharmacare? Will they maintain the dental care program for seniors and people with disabilities? They are not giving any answers or commitments. All the Conservatives want to do is make cuts, yet they will not tell us what they want to cut. I hope citizens will not have to wait for an election campaign to hear what their platform is.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8581387" data-originallang="fr"> Right now there is no way of knowing where they will get the savings they need if they are truly interested in reducing the budget and public spending. I am deeply troubled by the attitude of both the <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">leader of the official opposition</a> and the Conservative members in the House, which consists in systematically refusing to answer very clear questions on subjects that will affect the lives of millions of Canadians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8581388" data-originallang="fr">I would like it said, noted and recognized that there is absolutely no response or clear commitment on the part of the Conservatives in the House. I think that at some point they will have to be transparent with people, reveal who they truly are and lay their cards on the table, so that people can make fully informed decisions. We, for our part, have a record of achievement.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8581389" data-originallang="fr">For two and a half years we have forced the minority government to do things they had never agreed to do in the past. Examples include the anti-scab bill, sick leave and the basis for a drug plan to reimburse contraceptives as well as drugs for nine million diabetes patients in Canada. There is also the dental care program that has already benefited 700,000 Canadians, including a large majority of seniors. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8581390" data-originallang="fr">Let us return to the debate before us today. I commend my NDP colleague from <a data-HoCid="278718" href="/politicians/bonita-zarrillo/" title="Bonita Zarrillo">Port Moody—Coquitlam</a> on moving this motion to adopt the report of the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities in order to discuss an issue of great concern for all of our communities. It affects millions of people and, in particular, one million persons with disabilities who also live in poverty.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8581391" data-originallang="fr">I would now like to take the time to read the Committee's recommendation, because no one has done so since this morning and I think it is worth it. It reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8581392" data-originallang="fr"> In the opinion of the committee, the government should safeguard the Canada Disability Benefit from any potential clawbacks and engage in comprehensive consultations with the disability community to ensure the effective implementation of the Canada Disability Benefit by: </p>
<p data-HoCid="8581393" data-originallang="fr"> (i) ensuring that the Canada Disability Benefit is adequate to lift people living with disabilities out of poverty, </p>
<p data-HoCid="8581394" data-originallang="fr"> (ii) ensuring that the Canada Disability Benefit is accessible through the reconsideration of the Disability Tax Credit as a barrier to access, and establishing a more equitable and accessible enrolment method, </p>
<p data-HoCid="8581395" data-originallang="fr"> (iii) acknowledging the multitude of unseen expenses associated with living with a disability, which exacerbates financial strain, particularly amidst escalating costs of living and inflation crises, </p>
<p data-HoCid="8581396" data-originallang="fr"> (iv) recognizing the adverse impact of benefit entitlement reductions as families earn higher taxable incomes, perpetuating cycles of poverty among lower-income households, </p>
<p data-HoCid="8581397" data-originallang="fr"> (v) collaborating with provinces and territories to fortify support systems for individuals with disabilities, thereby fostering inclusive and supportive communities across the country. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8581398" data-originallang="fr"> And the Committee report this to the House. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8581399" data-originallang="fr">This is an excellent recommendation, and I am glad that we can discuss it in the House, because it could really fix the mistakes made by the Liberal government. It could also address the broken promise in the legislation resulting from Bill <a data-HoCid="11826019" href="/bills/44-1/C-22/" title="An Act to reduce poverty and to support the financial security of persons with disabilities by establishing the Canada disability benefit and making a consequential amendment to the Income Tax Act">C-22</a>, which is woefully inadequate. The Liberals have been promising concrete measures to lift people with disabilities out of poverty since 2015, but this reminds me of the story about the mountain that laboured and brought forth a mouse. Instead of really strong measures to lift people out of poverty, what did they get? They got 200 bucks a month, which is peanuts. That is nothing. It is more like giving people a few crumbs and telling them they have to make do with it, when what we wanted was a meaningful measure that would lift one million people out of poverty, people who are living in extreme hardship every day.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8581400" data-originallang="fr">I wanted to talk about this because for people like myself and many others who do not live with disabilities, it is hard to imagine what life must be like for those who must rely on a wheelchair. This is a rather ordinary example. What I am saying is not terribly original, but over the years, as I worked with groups in my riding, I have learned how much everything we consider normal and easy and take for granted can be difficult and painful—finding a job, for example. Indeed, unemployment among persons with disabilities, an already vulnerable group, is far higher than the overall average. It is harder for them to access the job market. They are less likely to be hired than other groups of people in society, which contributes to their financial difficulties and makes them more prone to poverty.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8581401" data-originallang="fr">Special needs housing is expensive. Small things like going to the grocery store, returning home and making something to eat when the person's home has not been adapted for their situation, whether they have to use a wheelchair or are living with other disabilities, are no easy tasks. Small things we do not even think of drive up the cost of special needs housing, and subsidies are not always available. This creates problems. People become dependent on their family, friends and neighbours. Every little activity of daily living becomes more difficult. It costs a massive amount of money to address this issue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8581402" data-originallang="fr">The Liberals had promised to help these people avoid hardship in their daily lives, but no, the problems remain. They have an haphazard, piecemeal approach. They say the promise was kept, but it is all smoke and mirrors, and it will not benefit the people in need. The groups are disappointed. Persons with disabilities are disappointed, angry and frustrated because their needs are not being met.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8581403" data-originallang="fr">Another need in the daily lives of persons with disabilities is transportation. Not everyone can afford a car, especially the poor. The measure is insufficient to ensure the availability of adapted public transit. The schedule is a problem because buses do not come often enough. People often have to hire a taxi because the bus or paratransit is unavailable or has broken down, or cannot get there for another three hours, when the person might have a doctor's appointment in 15 minutes and needs to get there fast.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8581404" data-originallang="fr">We may not necessarily think of all these small costs and charges. I represent a Montreal riding that includes a handful of subway stations equipped with elevators. Universal access is not a given. Getting into the subway station is one thing, but getting out is another. Sometimes, people have to travel three or four subway stations past their destination just to get to an elevator. Then what? They wait for a bus that takes forever to come.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8581405" data-originallang="fr">All these little things add up to make persons with disabilities more vulnerable. We thought that the Liberal government would recognize that, but no. The relevant word here is “disappointment”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8581406" data-originallang="fr">I was talking about that disappointment with groups in my riding of Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie, which I am very proud to represent here. There are a dozen or so of them, namely, the Association d'aide et de loisirs pour personnes à autonomie réduite, or ALPAR; the Regroupement des organismes spécialisés pour l'emploi des personnes handicapées; the Association multiethnique pour l'intégration des personnes handicapées du Québec; Compagnons de Montréal; Giant Steps Autism Centre; the Association des Parents pour la déficience intellectuelle, or PARDI; the Regroupement pour la trisomie 21; DéfPhys sans limite—</p>
