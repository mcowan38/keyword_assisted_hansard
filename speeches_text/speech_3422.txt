<p data-HoCid="8126921" data-originallang="en">Yes, section 810 is usually the normal peace bond. Admittedly, 12 months is.... I've never seen it. The legislation does contemplate something that is outside of the norm of section 810, which is the peace bond section that would ordinarily be invoked for these types of incidents.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8126922" data-originallang="en"> However, I think it's important for us to understand why the drafter contemplated an extra time. I'm going to refer to my esteemed colleague Ms. Gazan, who eloquently stated that laws for children have different reporting or duty-to-report requirements. That has been modified. I'm not trying to infantilize women and put them in the same category as children, but when we're dealing with intimate partners, I would like it, perhaps, if the experts could explain to us why this would not be an exception outside of the regular section 810 peace bond. I'm sure that the drafter of the legislation would have known what the normal course of the peace bond would be.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8126923" data-originallang="en">Could the experts just explain the difference? These individuals wouldn't have been convicted of an offence as of yet when this is invoked. Is that correct? I just want clarification.</p>
