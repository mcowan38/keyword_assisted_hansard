<p data-HoCid="7988876" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988877" data-originallang="en">With that, Chair, I am going to move the motion that I put on notice:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7988878" data-originallang="en"> That, in light of multiple news outlets reporting that Qatar is housing the leadership of Hamas; and given the fact that Qatar is now the preferred choice to supply liquefied natural gas (LNG) to our G7 allies in Germany, France, and Japan; and given the fact that Qatar and Shell plc have signed a supply deal for the Netherlands, the committee recognize that there is not only a business case for Canadian LNG but a moral case as well; and that this committee report to the House its recommendation that the Liberal Government champion the export of Canadian LNG. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7988879" data-originallang="en">This is important because there was a CBC article that came out the other day highlighting this. We raised it here in committee last week. I raised it on the floor of the House of Commons in question period, and it was dismissed as being a conspiracy theory by the <a data-HoCid="293795" href="/politicians/marc-serre/" title="Marc Serré">parliamentary secretary</a>. The CBC article says:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7988880" data-originallang="en"> On October 7, as Hamas gunmen rampaged across southern Israel, a group of middle-aged men in a luxury suite in Doha, Qatar gathered in front of a camera. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7988881" data-originallang="en"> Hamas leaders...recorded themselves showing surprise about the attacks from the news on a large-screen television, and then kneeling to give thanks...[for what had happened there.] </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7988882" data-originallang="en">On the one hand, they're trying to talk out of both sides of their mouth, but it doesn't change the point that Qatar is supplying the world with LNG while also housing the leadership team of Hamas. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7988883" data-originallang="en">I think it's important to show that we take this issue very seriously because this is an energy security issue, and Canada has the opportunity to play a role here. We have heard over and over that Canada has the capacity to be the global supplier for LNG, but the government has left multiple countries in the dark on this. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7988884" data-originallang="en">In fact, we had the German Chancellor come over to Canada asking for LNG, and that's the famous quote we got when the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> said that there was not a business case for it, despite the fact that Germany came specifically saying that Canada would be the best and most preferred option for LNG around the world. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7988885" data-originallang="en">After that, we had Japan come, and Japan was also asking for Canadian LNG. The <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> once again declined that as well. Now we start to see how the world market is shaping up. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7988886" data-originallang="en">There are five countries, because this morning, Italy was another one to join the mix and sign a 27-year agreement with Qatar to supply their LNG. As of this morning, you have Italy. Over the weekend I think the Netherlands also signed a big agreement as well. The three that I just listed there are Japan, France—that was the fifth one that I didn't mention—and Germany. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7988887" data-originallang="en">Multiple countries came to Canada offering the business case for it. They were told that there was, in fact, not a business case, but now we're up to five countries around the world that have signed 27-year agreements with Qatar to supply them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988888" data-originallang="en">When you look at the future of it here, QatarEnergy will contribute 40% of all new LNG to the market by 2029. This is the same Qatar that.... I have an executive summary from a human rights report here. I'm going to read this: </p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7988889" data-originallang="en"> Significant human rights issues included credible reports of: serious restrictions on free expression, including the existence of criminal libel laws; substantial interference with the freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association, including overly restrictive laws on the organization, funding, or operation of nongovernmental organizations and civil society organizations; restrictions on migrant workers’ freedom of movement, access to justice, and vulnerability to abuses, including forced labor; inability of citizens to change their government peacefully in free and fair elections; serious and unreasonable restrictions on political participation, including a complete prohibition on political parties; lack of investigation and accountability for gender-based violence; existence of laws criminalizing consensual same-sex sexual conduct; and prohibitions on independent trade unions. </p>
