<p data-HoCid="8663283" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8663284" data-originallang="en">Honourable members of the committee, I want to thank you for inviting us today to speak about the situation in Lebanon.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8663285" data-originallang="fr">As you know, Canada and Lebanon have very close ties. The Lebanese community in Canada numbers over 200,000 people, while more than 50,000 Canadians live in Lebanon.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8663286" data-originallang="en"> This year marks 70 years of diplomatic relations between both countries. Since 2023, Canada has celebrated Lebanese Heritage Month in November. This year, however, it will take place against a backdrop of a devastating situation in the country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8663287" data-originallang="en"> The escalating conflict has already had a severe impact. Over 2,500 people have been killed, and 9,000 people have been injured. Over 1.2 million people have been displaced from their homes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8663288" data-originallang="fr">We express our heartfelt condolences to all the families and communities affected by the violence. We are sad to hear of the deaths of Canadian citizens.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8663289" data-originallang="en"> Since the beginning of the conflict, Canada has expressed its concern with the ongoing fighting between Hezbollah and Israel. Not only is it having a disproportionate impact on civilians on both sides of the blue line separating Israel and Lebanon, but it also poses a significant threat to security and stability in the wider region.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8663290" data-originallang="fr">Along with our G7 partners, Canada is advocating for a ceasefire to pave the way for a diplomatic solution. We have also reaffirmed our full support for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, and the critical role it plays in promoting a settlement that complies with UN Security Council Resolution 1701.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8663291" data-originallang="en"> Canada remains committed to diplomacy as the only suitable path to stabilize the Israel-Lebanon border; to fully restore the sovereignty, territorial integrity and stability of Lebanon; and to return displaced citizens to their homes with safety and security in both Lebanon and Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8663292" data-originallang="en">Canada firmly condemns Hezbollah's continued attacks on Israel. We cannot forget that one of the stated goals of Hezbollah, a listed terrorist entity, is the very destruction of the State of Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8663293" data-originallang="en">Hezbollah's attacks on Israel serve only to further destabilize the region. As such, Canada supports Israel's right to self-defence in accordance with international law. Indeed, all parties to the conflict must uphold their obligations under international law to ensure the safety and security of civilians, as well as the protection of first responders and UNIFIL personnel. Like our G7 partners, Canada was dismayed by the Israel Defense Forces' attacks affecting the UNIFIL positions along the Blue Line.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8663294" data-originallang="fr">The humanitarian impact of the conflict in Lebanon is enormous. In 2024, Canada has committed nearly $50 million in humanitarian assistance to Lebanon. The displaced population includes Syrian refugees, some of whom have started to return to Syria. Canada insists that any return of refugees must be safe, dignified and voluntary, in accordance with international law.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8663295" data-originallang="en"> The humanitarian crisis in Lebanon is unfolding while it already grapples with a severe political and economic domestic crisis. Poverty in Lebanon has more than tripled over the past decade, reaching 44% of the total population. Lebanon has been without a president since October 2022. Canada has been a steady partner in addressing Lebanon's longer-term development challenges while urging it to elect a president, form a new government and enact essential reforms without delay. Since 2016, Canada has allocated over $136 million in development assistance to Lebanon under the Middle East strategy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8663296" data-originallang="fr">Canada has also funded peace and security programs in Lebanon. In co-operation with the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces, we are providing training, equipment and infrastructure to the Lebanese armed forces so that they can counter terrorist and transnational criminal threats while ensuring the integrity and security of Lebanon's borders.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8663297" data-originallang="en">Finally, Canada remains concerned about the thousands of Canadians currently living in Lebanon. Since October 2023, we have been advising Canadians to avoid all travel to Lebanon or, for those who are there, to leave while commercial options remain available. The department has also improved its contingency planning with other government departments and like-minded partners, including a non-combatant evacuation operation, if required.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8663298" data-originallang="en">As the security situation deteriorated in late September, Global Affairs Canada facilitated options for Canadians, permanent residents and their eligible family members to leave Lebanon. As a result, over 1,500 departures were facilitated, including for 300 internationals. The Government of Canada continues to provide information about departure opportunities on commercial flights out of Lebanon. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8663299" data-originallang="fr">I look forward to your questions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8663300" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
