<p data-HoCid="8714703" data-originallang="fr">In an advisory opinion issued in July 2024, the International Court of Justice stated that Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories was unlawful. It added that states had an obligation not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by Israel's unlawful presence in the occupied Palestinian territories.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714704" data-originallang="fr">In your opinion, under the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement, which considers products manufactured in Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, is Canada aiding or assisting in the maintenance of the situation created by Israel's illegal presence in the occupied Palestinian territories? </p>
