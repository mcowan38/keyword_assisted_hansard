<p data-HoCid="8098648" data-originallang="en">I think it's the number of allegations that have been made. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8098649" data-originallang="en">The ICC is not an especially well-funded court. It gets, I think, the equivalent of an hour of military expenditure from the Iraq war, less than sports teams get on this continent, and it has all of its jurisdiction to deal with and so many different situations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098650" data-originallang="en">Again, under the best of circumstances, it might be able to prosecute a handful of individuals, but the litany of war crimes, crimes against humanity and other allegations that we're seeing, I think demand something in addition to just the ICC. Again, a hybrid court would be difficult to create because it would need the buy-in of the Palestinians and the Israelis, but I think it's worthwhile exploring.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8098651" data-originallang="en">Indeed, Canada has done this similarly for Ukraine. Canada understands that in Ukraine, the ICC is not enough. It has supported Ukrainian prosecutions of war crimes in their own domestic system, which is very important. It is also supporting, or is at least engaged in, the creation of an additional tribunal to investigate and prosecute crimes.</p>
