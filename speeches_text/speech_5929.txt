<p data-HoCid="8823585" data-originallang="en"> Thank you for that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8823586" data-originallang="en"> I have to say that it has been an extremely difficult time for so many communities in this country, particularly the Jewish and Muslim communities. We have seen the rise in hate and the anxieties that have been fuelled by hate and division.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8823587" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, do you know what doesn't help? What doesn't help is when we put forward supports to support Canadians—supports that the Jewish community asked for—when we appointed the first-ever special envoy to fight anti-Semitism in this country and when we enhanced funding for her department, which is what the community asked for, and the Conservatives voted against that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8823588" data-originallang="en">When the community asked for $25 million for the new Montreal Holocaust museum, the Conservatives voted against that funding. When we put forward $274 million to combat hate and to put forward actions on the ground, the Conservative Party of Canada voted against it. When it comes to hundreds of millions for anti-racism programs through Canada's anti-racism strategy, the Conservatives voted against it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8823589" data-originallang="en">It is shameful that they come here and pretend they care about Jewish Canadians when, with every chance they have gotten, they have voted against the very support that we have put forward.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8823590" data-originallang="en">In fact, we have seen the <a data-HoCid="278241" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">leader of the Conservative Party</a> meet with members of far-right, extremist groups like Diagolon, who fundamentally believe that people like me and others do not belong in Canada. It is shameful for them to pretend like they care when their leader will use, on his YouTube videos, hashtags that actually attract men who hate women. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8823591" data-originallang="en">Do you want to talk about gender-based violence and what perpetuates that? It's those kinds of things.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8823592" data-originallang="en">When they come here and pretend they care about hate in this country, it's shameful. It is absolutely shameful when they vote against and actually incite hate in this country with their <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">leader</a> and with their conspiracy theories.</p>
