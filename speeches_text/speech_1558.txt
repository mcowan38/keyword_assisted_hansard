<p data-HoCid="7125324" data-originallang="en">Urban Rez Solutions Social Enterprise prides itself, I would say, on imparting social education where the traditional school systems have not, whether it be on anti-Black racism or anti-Semitism or in terms of under-represented groups having a voice, and empowering community to have a voice when they often have not been seen or heard. We look through a lens or we work through a lens of empowerment, of giving people that voice to be able to be at the tables as opposed to being on the menus.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125325" data-originallang="en">Often we find ourselves working in very challenged communities or situations just based on the oppression and the self-fulfilling prophecies that have often accompanied hatred and oppression and how people view themselves. We try to reverse-engineer some of that narrative but also give a sense of a new social conditioning or an opportunity to rewrite a narrative that has often been written by somebody else, somebody who hasn't had our best interests at heart.</p>
