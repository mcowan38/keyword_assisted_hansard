<p data-HoCid="6956607" data-originallang="fr">Our approach has always taken intersectionality into account. We consider the various forms of oppression that exist. A lot of research has been done on the child protection system and the challenges around the recognition of family violence [<em>Technical difficultyâ€”Editor</em>]. Simon Lapierre, a University of Ottawa professor, does work in that area.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6956608" data-originallang="fr">His book <em>Failure to Protect</em> reveals the extent to which all the responsibility is placed on mothers. They have to protect their children who are being victimized, without the support of the child protection system. Unfortunately, studies also show the extent to which indigenous and immigrant women are subjected to significantly more restrictive measures, under the child protection system.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6956609" data-originallang="fr">Every year, our organization puts on a breakfast for men who stand up against violence against women. For a number of years now, we've also worked with CEGEPs, speaking to young men and women about how they can be allies in combatting violence against women. We talk to young people who are studying police science, delinquent conduct, psychosocial intervention and social work, because it's important to discuss how men can be allies, both personally and professionally.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6956610" data-originallang="fr">It's essential to hear from men who speak out because, thankfully, they aren't all violent. We need men who are not violent to make their collective and individual voices heard, so they can truly be role models for young men and women.</p>
