<p data-HoCid="7418310" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, last week I attended Rise Up Ottawa, where we heard from students as young as 12 years old about unacceptable acts of hatred they experience just because they are Jewish. Many of them said they are hiding their Jewish identity to avoid being targeted. A brave teacher, Lisa Levitan, coordinated the event to give these youth a voice.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7418311" data-originallang="en">Nobody should feel scared to go to school because of their religion. No child should hide who they are in fear of Nazi symbols and rhetoric that should be so anathema to our society that they would be shunned instantaneously, yet they are not.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7418312" data-originallang="en">We need to teach all young people about the Holocaust, so they learn the danger of indifference to oppression.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7418313" data-originallang="en">The member for <a data-HoCid="278578" href="/politicians/yasir-naqvi/" title="Yasir Naqvi">Ottawa Centre</a> and I were among the only non-Jewish participants. We all have an obligation to speak out. To be silent is to cause harm. I ask the House to join me in calling for an end to Jew hatred.</p>
