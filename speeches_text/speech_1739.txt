<p data-HoCid="7194547" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, it is an honour today to speak to Bill <a data-HoCid="11536206" href="/bills/44-1/C-233/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Judges Act (violence against an intimate partner)">C-233</a>. I would like to start by thanking the member for <a data-HoCid="278401" href="/politicians/anju-dhillon/" title="Anju Dhillon">Dorval—Lachine—LaSalle</a> for putting forward and creating space for the bill. Throughout her career, she has been a tremendous advocate for those who have suffered from domestic and partner violence, both for those who have endured physical violence and for those who have silently suffered emotional and psychological abuse: coercive control that is no less harmful and in many cases has a violent or even deadly outcome after protracted years of silent suffering.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7194548" data-originallang="en">The member understands deeply that deterrent tools to preventing such violence, which happens to far too many partners and their children behind closed doors in far too many homes in this country, require education and a trained comprehension to effectively use the tools in our legislative tool box to protect those who are most vulnerable in a court system that is, in many cases, failing them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7194549" data-originallang="en">When the member for <a data-HoCid="278602" href="/politicians/pam-damoff/" title="Pam Damoff">Oakville North—Burlington</a> and I came to the member with the story of Keira Kagan, she compassionately understood and made space for the work we are debating today. We have heard the story of Keira Kagan: the little girl who was the brightest of sparks who was tragically lost and whose death was completely preventable. I note, as did other members, that yesterday should have been her seventh birthday. We have shared the tireless advocacy of her mother, Dr. Jennifer Kagan-Viater, and her stepfather, Phil Viater, on the floor of the House. It was a parent's cry for justice in a system where there was every effort to do what every mother wants to do at the very core of her being: protect her child.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7194550" data-originallang="en">We heard their call. It became the siren for many others, including leading advocates for women from my community in York Centre and from across this country who were no longer asking, but demanding that light be shed on this pervasive form of abuse: to name it, to know it and from there to be able to use the tools we have to protect them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7194551" data-originallang="en">To each one of the large and small organizations in my riding, from Tikvah Toronto to the North York Women's Shelter, from local advocates for immigrant and racialized women to the National Council of Jewish Women of Canada, Toronto chapter, and to the many parents and victim-centred organizations from coast to coast to coast, I can clearly and with gratitude say as we enter the last hours of debate here in the House that they have been heard.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7194552" data-originallang="en">It is a rare but incredible thing when we have consensus across the floor. When we do, we know it is because we have heard the call of Canadians at the deepest levels.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7194553" data-originallang="en">Bill <a data-HoCid="11536206" href="/bills/44-1/C-233/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Judges Act (violence against an intimate partner)">C-233</a> was first tabled in early February. It went through to second reading and to committee in April with a co-operative effort to move schedules and get it to the important work of the committee by May. I would like to thank the member for <a data-HoCid="278265" href="/politicians/karen-vecchio/" title="Karen Vecchio">Elgin—Middlesex—London</a>, in her role as chair for the status of women committee. She, like many of us, understood the importance of the bill and her co-operation and leadership from across the floor must be acknowledged as we contemplate the bill now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7194554" data-originallang="en">Much of the work that goes into the legislative process involves many conversations and emails, coordination of witnesses and stakeholders, asking the hardest of questions and unpacking key issues here and at committee. Each of the members who I have mentioned played a key role in the learning and advocacy that has taken place for Bill <a data-HoCid="11536206" href="/bills/44-1/C-233/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Judges Act (violence against an intimate partner)">C-233</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7194555" data-originallang="en">Bill <a data-HoCid="11536206" href="/bills/44-1/C-233/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Judges Act (violence against an intimate partner)">C-233</a> seeks to address two key components of education and legislative tools. It amends the Judges Act to expand judicial education, which currently covers topics such as sexual assault and social context, to include coercive control in domestic violence. It amends the Criminal Code to require a justice to consider whether an accused who is charged with intimate partner violence should wear an electronic monitoring device before a release order is made.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7194556" data-originallang="en">Through this process, we have shed light on the definition of coercive control. An important piece of this legislation is providing education to understand that while physical forms of intimate partner violence and domestic violence are well known and easy to detect, there are more covert forms of psychological abuse that are not always recognized as violence.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7194557" data-originallang="en">Coercive control can often be an early indicator that abusive relationships will escalate into physical or even lethal violence. A study of femicides from 2015-19 found coercive, controlling behaviours such as stalking, isolation and threats were frequent components. On average, a woman is killed by an intimate partner every six days in this country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7194558" data-originallang="en">The patterns of behaviour for coercive control are intended to isolate, humiliate, exploit or dominate a victim. This can include emotional, verbal and financial abuse; isolation, such as preventing someone from going to work or school; and limiting their access to finances.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7194559" data-originallang="en">This invisible chain of behaviour escalates and can be quite visible through warning signs, when we know them, that include monitoring movements, sexual coercion, threats to harm a child and restricting access to money or even food. This outline of coercive control only scratches the surface of what judges will need training on in what has until now been a murky side of the court system. Victims straddle family and criminal court systems, and there is a dire, and at times deadly, impact on children.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7194560" data-originallang="en">We now understand the pathology of this form of intimate partner violence. It is unseen and brutally harmful. Its victims are the partners and children of these relationships where dependency, vulnerability and children themselves become weaponized. We cannot look away any longer.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7194561" data-originallang="en">The second aspect of Bill <a data-HoCid="11536206" href="/bills/44-1/C-233/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Judges Act (violence against an intimate partner)">C-233</a> addresses the contemplation of using e-monitoring as a deterrent tool. In Keira Kagan's case, her father had 53 court orders against him. None ultimately served as a tool to keep her safe from harm. What we know is that education and implementation go hand in hand, and that is what this bill intends to do. It is a start.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7194562" data-originallang="en">There are those who see these amendments as first steps. We heard from many national advocates who expressed their concerns on the implementation of e-monitoring in terms of the settings and who would be subject to it. There is undoubtedly more work to do; there always is, but we must start and we have.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7194563" data-originallang="en">With this bill, coercive control and its understanding would become part of the language used within our legislative system. Our judicial system would have the tools to be educated on this and to identify it when it is in their courts. It would have deterrent tools that could prevent escalating violence in a cycle that does not end with the separation of a relationship.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7194564" data-originallang="en">We must be talking about this, and Bill <a data-HoCid="11536206" href="/bills/44-1/C-233/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Judges Act (violence against an intimate partner)">C-233</a> has opened the conversation nationally, so that judicial training can set a precedent for the discussion of coercive control and the needed deterrent tools in other aspects of our system, be it with lawyers, social workers, health care workers or the many aspects of our system that are meant to protect victims and children.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7194565" data-originallang="en">We are in lockstep with other countries doing this work and exploring education on and, in some cases, criminalization of coercive control. These range from Australia, where studies have been done on the impact and potential criminality of it in the framework of domestic violence since as early as 2020, to the United Kingdom's section 76, which includes coercive controlling behaviour in an intimate family relationship as an offence.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7194566" data-originallang="en">Even here in Ontario, more recently than any of the above mentioned, the former Bill <a data-HoCid="9868788" href="/bills/42-1/C-78/" title="An Act to amend the Divorce Act, the Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act and the Garnishment, Attachment and Pension Diversion Act and to make consequential amendments to another Act">C-78</a> sought to update the definition of “family violence” in the Divorce Act to include “coercive and controlling behaviour”. The discussions and the work have begun, so that we can ensure the victims are not left unprotected.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7194567" data-originallang="en">Each morning I wake up and spend a short bit of time in the practice of the Jewish tradition called Daf Yomi, the daily page of Talmud, whereby around the world, over a cycle of seven and a half years, an entire community studies a page of law. We review the compendium of Jewish law that has evolved over thousands of years, studying each debate, each small change and its lead-in to the next. We are taught to first learn much and then seek to understand it profoundly.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7194568" data-originallang="en">This daily practice humbles me and reminds me that, each day in the House, we are putting our efforts forward to create change, and that the work we do here each day is a small step that makes space, as the member for <a data-HoCid="278401" href="/politicians/anju-dhillon/" title="Anju Dhillon">Dorval—Lachine—LaSalle</a> has done, and sheds light to understand how we can protect and create safety for our community and all of its members, especially its most vulnerable. It is a profound responsibility and a privilege to do this work, and we must. For the many victims of abuse, families, partners and children, we owe it to them to protect them, and yes, we owe it to Keira Kagan.</p>
