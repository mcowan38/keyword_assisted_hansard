<p data-HoCid="8793997" data-originallang="en"> This phenomenon has grown. I referenced the report by Irene Khan that talks about this global repression we are seeing around expression on Palestine. It has grown. It is present in places where academic freedom is revered, including spaces like journalism, artistic and art spaces, and academic freedom. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8793998" data-originallang="en">What we have been seeing is, again, the use of hate. Whether it be through institutional policies or hate speech, it's being used and interpreted as not extending to Palestinian speech. While these pieces of legislation or policy are intended to protect the rights of minorities to speak up, criticize governments and so on, when it comes to Palestinian speech, all of a sudden we hear, “No, you can't say that.” Whatever is being said is being described as something that extends to hate speech, which is a very high bar. Therefore, we start seeing criminalization or reprisals in the employment sector. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8793999" data-originallang="en">This is having a real impact, and not just on Palestinians. In the last year, we have seen these provisions or the description of anything related to Palestine expression as supportive of terror or as anti-Semitic. It is being applied to racialized and marginalized Canadians. I have gotten a lot of calls in the legal profession, for instance, from young Black women being fired from their Bay Street jobs because they supported Palestinian rights in an open letter. I've had colleagues who've lost their office space because the person they were renting the space from disagreed with their work defending Palestinian rights. As criminal defence lawyers, they were defending protesters who have been arrested. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8794000" data-originallang="en">This is having a chilling effect on expression. We just keep seeing it entrenched further and further. We are concerned that people will be afraid to speak out on Palestine, especially if they increasingly think they will be criminalized for it. That's the worst thing we can have happen right now, when we do have a plausible genocide unfolding and we do need people to speak out more than ever at this time.</p>
