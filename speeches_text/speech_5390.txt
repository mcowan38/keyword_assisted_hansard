<p data-HoCid="8703270" data-originallang="en"> I'm going to answer you with my personal experience because I lived in Palestine before the Oslo accords and afterward. I remember when the Palestinian Authority took over Ramallah. I left my medical school in Jordan and I went to celebrate in the streets of Ramallah. That's how the Palestinian people reacted to the peace process.</p>
