Of course, I should not have expected anything different from the anti-Israel members over there on the NDP bench.</p>

<p data-HoCid="8576734" data-originallang="en">There used to be a time when the NDP actually cared about workers. In fact, one could say that the NDP's raison d’être was promoting workers' right. That simply is no longer true. The mantle of workers' rights has been taken up by Conservatives. Instead, the NDP is now the party of the radical left, which is obsessed, absolutely obsessed, with Israel and its right to exist. It feels like that is all its members ever think about. They wake up in the morning and think, “How can I attack Israel today?”</p>
