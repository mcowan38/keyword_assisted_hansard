<p data-HoCid="8455798" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455799" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much for being here today. I cannot believe that, in my lifetime, we are having university presidents testify before a parliamentary committee about anti-Semitism on campus. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8455800" data-originallang="en">President Carr, respectfully, I don't believe empathy should be the number one goal; it should be protecting our kids and keeping our campuses safe from intimidation and harassment. That should be the number one goal here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455801" data-originallang="en"> I have some yes-or-no questions. I'd like to ask everybody to say yes or no. If you can't answer yes or no, say, “I can't answer,” but no more than that or I'll reclaim my time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455802" data-originallang="en"> I'm going to start with President Saini, followed by President Gertler, President Bacon and President Carr. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8455803" data-originallang="en">Do you acknowledge that anti-Semitism is a significant problem on your campus, President Saini?</p>
