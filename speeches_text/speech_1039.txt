<p data-HoCid="6761699" data-originallang="en"> I just want an answer to my first question to you, Mr. Ripley. I'm looking at the CRTC regulations right now. Under “What productions do not require CRTC certification?”, it lists, “Commercially released music video clips of 5 minutes or less” and “Public service announcements, interstitials, and any other productions of less than 5 minutes”. Just so this is clear, the CRTC regulations would not affect Instagram videos or audio. They would not affect TikTok videos. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6761700" data-originallang="en">We're talking about algorithms, and there is bias in these algorithms. A recent example was from May 5, the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, Red Dress Day. Hundreds of people had their posts disappeared on Instagram and on Facebook. Activists and journalists who have been posting material about Palestinians, Crimea, Kashmir and central Sahara have had their posts disappeared by these algorithmic biases and automated content moderation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6761701" data-originallang="en">We already have a serious problem with interference by corporate entities that are censoring Canadians, Canadian journalists and people who are trying to post about missing family members on Red Dress Day. The discussion around government interference is one thing, but we need to deal with this algorithmic interference by corporations who are censoring people. It's also come up a lot with people who are trying to share information about COVID. Whether we agree with it or not, people have a right to free speech. That includes all of these social justice movements that I mentioned. Black Lives Matter is another place where activists have complained about their posts being flagged or taken down by Facebook and Instagram. Twitter is doing the same thing. They are locking people's accounts and not letting them post. Facebook is doing the same thing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6761702" data-originallang="en">Right here on Vancouver Island, we have activists who are fighting to save the last 1% of old-growth forest that is on the cutting block. There's less than 3% of that old-growth forest left. Activists who are posting are having their posts flagged by loggers and then having their accounts locked for 30 days.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6761703" data-originallang="en">We already have a problem of censorship from the corporate sector who controls this. This is not democracy. This is corporatocracy. We need to have a serious discussion about how this is being dealt with. Social media is not free speech. It is controlled by the corporations who own these platforms.</p>
