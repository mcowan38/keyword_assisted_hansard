<p data-HoCid="8714910" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714911" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much for being here today and for sharing your expertise with us.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714912" data-originallang="en"> I wanted to start by reminding the committee that there are 145 countries that have recognized Palestine, including many of our allies. I would certainly not want to say that Spain, Norway and Ireland are not allies.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714913" data-originallang="en"> I also want to remind this committee that when the Rome Statute was put into place, the U.S. never signed on. While it is still our key trading partner and, of course, our key ally, Canada has a history of taking decisions and taking steps that are not in line with the United States. We do not share a foreign policy. We have our own sovereignty and can make our own decisions. I wanted to make that very clear.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714914" data-originallang="en"> One of the things I'd like to talk about is the right of return for Palestinians. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8714915" data-originallang="en">Months ago, I raised this issue with the <a data-HoCid="300012" href="/politicians/ahmed-hussen/" title="Ahmed Hussen">minister</a>. He was unable to answer my question at the time. Recent developments have demanded an urgent response. The IDF has now openly stated—we've seen this in reports that have come out in just the last few days—that Palestinians from northern Gaza will not be allowed to return home, which is a clear act of forcible transfer and ethnic cleansing. This systematic displacement not only steals land but undermines any future prospect of a viable Palestinian state.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714916" data-originallang="en"> What is Canada doing to condemn this blatant violation of international law? Is Global Affairs Canada prepared to speak out against this policy, or will we remain complicit through silence as this land theft and ethnic cleansing continue to shape the reality on the ground?</p>
