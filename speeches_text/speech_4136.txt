<p data-HoCid="8406212" data-originallang="en">Across the country, we've seen that universities are not properly upholding our rights as students. They need to be using their own policies, but they need to be very clear about how anti-Semitic incidents should be dealt with so that we're not put in the situation where, for months, we're being tossed around to different departments. They also need to be using their own student codes of conduct and to understand that even if hateful speech isn't the same as hate speech, it should still be seen as dangerous to the Jewish student community.</p>
