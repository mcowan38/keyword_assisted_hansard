<p data-HoCid="6520348" data-originallang="en">Seeing no further hands up, I think we have consensus that we're going to do an examination of the supplementary (C)s. The question is whether we move the questions around availability of witnesses, scheduling and allocation of time for the examination of the supplementary (C)s to the subcommittee.</p>

<p data-HoCid="6520350" data-originallang="en">Ms. Dancho, go ahead.</p>
