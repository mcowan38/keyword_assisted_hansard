<p data-HoCid="7683235" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7683236" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Ambassador, for being with us today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7683237" data-originallang="en">I also want to take a moment to thank you for the work you've done with regard to Ukraine. I was there recently. I saw, just as you described, that civilian targets have been the target of Russia. It's a horrendous war. I appreciate your voice on that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7683238" data-originallang="en">Ambassador, you spoke a lot about how the world is deeply troubled and all the challenges we face. One concern I have, as a Canadian, is that I don't understand our response to human rights around the world. It doesn't seem equitable. It doesn't seem fair. It seems like we pick and choose when we protect human rights and when we don't.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7683239" data-originallang="en">The first few questions I'd like to ask you are with regard to your role within the United Nations and Canada's record of voting with regard to Israel and Palestine. I don't think you'll be surprised to hear that I have some concerns about that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7683240" data-originallang="en">In recent years, Canada has voted against resolutions that call on the international community to increase humanitarian assistance to Palestine. We voted against a call that urges Israel to stop violating international law in occupied territories. We voted against reaffirming that Israel's settlements are illegal and an obstacle to peace. We voted against urging Israel to comply with provisions of international law.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7683241" data-originallang="en">Ambassador, Canada is in a minority of votes with these resolutions. We've joined Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Togo and Palau. We have not joined Norway, Sweden, Germany, the U.K., France and Denmark. This year, in particular, Canada voted against a resolution calling on the International Court of Justice to seek a simply advisory opinion on the illegality of Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7683242" data-originallang="en">I remind you, Ambassador, that Canada is very strongly calling for justice for Ukraine. I have been part of that call. We all, in this place, have been part of that call, but I don't understand why we have a different lens for different regions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7683243" data-originallang="en">Can you explain to me why Canada continues to vote against calls for justice and for Palestinian human rights?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7683244" data-originallang="en"> Will Canada's vote change in the coming year as a result of the dangerous policies of the extreme right-wing government in Israel and the growing crisis, which is negatively impacting both Israelis and Palestinians?</p>
