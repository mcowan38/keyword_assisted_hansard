<p data-HoCid="8783174" data-originallang="en">Mr. MacGregor, I'm trying to assist you as best I can. The determination, ultimately, about what constitutes a war crime is for an international tribunal. That is not before me, and I'm not going to speculate about it. What I can say to you is that Canada's policy has been that the annexed territory of the West Bank is occupied territory and that the settlements themselves constitute illegal settlements. We've articulated that many times over the past many years.</p>
