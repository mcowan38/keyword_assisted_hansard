<p data-HoCid="8576595" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, following up on the question of my friend from Winnipeg, one thing I have noticed in the debate tonight is that there is a certain lack of specificity in responses or explanations from some members. I understand the desire of people to express a hope for peace and a desire for greater collaboration and goodwill, but the way we operationalize that is through specific suggestions. Members talk about Israel having a right to defend itself and about wanting peace and to hold terrorist groups accountable, but members are not willing to specify exactly the mechanics of that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576596" data-originallang="en">What does it mean for Israel to have a right to defend itself, for example, in practice.</p>
