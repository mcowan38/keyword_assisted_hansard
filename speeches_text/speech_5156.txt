<p data-HoCid="8679398" data-originallang="en">As I mentioned earlier—or I should have mentioned—the International Court of Justice made it clear that Canada has an obligation, first, not to recognize the legality of Israel's continued presence in the territory or to do anything to either aid or assist it in the maintenance of its illegal presence in the territory. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679399" data-originallang="en">This requires a complete revolution in the bilateral relations among all states—but in this case, Canada and Israel—to ensure that none of those relations do anything to help Israel maintain its presence in the occupied Palestinian territory. This covers economic, political and diplomatic relations, social relations, civil relations, the whole lot. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679400" data-originallang="en">We have, for instance, a free trade agreement with Israel, which is all good. Canada can do that with Israel, but that free trade agreement recognizes that Israel defines Israel as including the occupied Palestinian territory. This is a violation of the ICJ advisory opinion. It is a violation of the peremptory right of Palestinian people to self-determination. The agreement itself, as a matter of international law—see article 53 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties—is illegal, <em>ab initio</em>. This needs to be reviewed. </p>
