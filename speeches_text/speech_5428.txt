<p data-HoCid="8703169" data-originallang="en">I too would say that it's critically important that Canada hold Israel to its obligations before the International Court of Justice to end its occupation as rapidly as possible. This is something that is unconditional. It's not something to be negotiated. It's something that is mandated by the world's top court.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703170" data-originallang="en">Canada often expresses support for the court, but has not articulated its support for the specific findings of the ICJ. It would be good to see Canada actually say that it expects Israel's occupation to end as soon as possible and to participate in all actions internationally through the UN and others to achieve that. </p>
