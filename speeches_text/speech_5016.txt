<p data-HoCid="8595068" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, today is the first anniversary of the Hamas attack on Israel. On that horrific day, Hamas killed over 1,200 people, including eight Canadians, and over 200 were taken hostage. At home, in one year there have been nearly 5,800 incidents of hatred and anti-Semitism, including Samidoun posters today for a Toronto event under the heading “Long live October 7.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8595069" data-originallang="en">The government's pathetic condemnation of Hamas with no action on domestic pro-Hamas supporters does nothing to end violence and intimidation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8595070" data-originallang="en">Will the government give up its veiled support for terrorist sympathizers? The safety of our citizens is the only priority.</p>
