<p data-HoCid="7852267" data-originallang="en">Thank you. I appreciate that clarification.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7852268" data-originallang="en">Deacon Bennett, I have a question for you. I agree that, when someone is in a situation of crisis, they turn towards their faith and begin a spiritual journey, perhaps. I imagine that members in the armed forces are at a particular place and point in their lives where they may need this service and where they may need this guidance.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7852269" data-originallang="en">We also know, though, that we're opening up and we're trying to be as inclusive as possible in the armed forces. There are members of different backgrounds. There are members of the LGBTQIA+ community, and obviously everybody needs to be respectful. We're moving towards a better culture in the armed forces.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7852270" data-originallang="en">Given this context, can you elaborate a little on how we could go forward, allowing people, pastors, imams, rabbis and spiritual leaders of all faiths to be involved while still maintaining that level of respect for all members of the CAF?</p>
