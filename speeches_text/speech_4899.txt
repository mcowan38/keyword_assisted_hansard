<p data-HoCid="8576651" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the member's speech referenced that there is an awful lot of anti-Semitism across this country. That is undoubtedly true and something that every member of the House is appalled by. We should be doing everything we can to limit all anti-Semitism, anti-Palestinian racism, Islamophobia and all the sorts of discrimination we are seeing increase exponentially right now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576652" data-originallang="en">However, I have to say that I was in the House when a member of a Conservative Party used Hezbollah slurs and talked of pagers when addressing an Israeli Canadian member of Parliament. If that is not anti-Semitism and appalling behaviour from the Conservative Party, I wonder whether the member would find that appropriate if it had been directed at another member of the House of Commons.</p>
