<p data-HoCid="6706682" data-originallang="fr"> Mr. Speaker, there have been consultations among the parties and I think you will find unanimous consent for the following motion: That the House (a) condemn the resurgence of violence between Palestine and Israel that led to the death of at least seven Israelis and more than 83 Palestinians; (b) call upon the parties to implement an immediate ceasefire; (c) reaffirm its support for finding a two-state solution; (d) call upon Israel to stop colonizing and annexing Palestinian territories; (e) ask the Palestinian Authority to denounce Hamas's rocket fire on Israel's civilian population; and (f) urge both Palestinian and Israeli leaders to quickly return to the negotiating table to achieve a lasting peace between the two peoples.</p>
