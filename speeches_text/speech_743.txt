<p data-HoCid="6620056" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="253019" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> for her work on this issue and her leadership on this issue, as well as the leadership of her party in hopefully supporting this time allocation motion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6620057" data-originallang="en">We are here because of the dilatory tactics of the Conservative Party on other measures, such as the fall economic statement which was debated. Those debates were repeated ad nauseam even though the content of that bill was meant to help Canadians in facing the worst pandemic we have faced in 100 years.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6620058" data-originallang="en">We are here because this bill is known to the House of Commons. As the hon. member points out, it went through the previous Parliament in its previous form when it was brought forward as a private member's bill by Romeo Saganash. It only died in the Senate because of, again, the blocking and dilatory tactics of Conservative senators to let it die on the Order Paper.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6620059" data-originallang="en">We are moving because this is a bill that needs to be passed. We need to get to the next stage, which is the action plan co-developed with indigenous peoples across Canada, in order to get us all to a better place. It is a bill about indigenous human rights. We are very much supportive of that and we very much wish to move this forward.</p>
