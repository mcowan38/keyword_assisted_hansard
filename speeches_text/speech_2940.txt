<p data-HoCid="7961440" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, recently, the city of Elliot Lake lost a giant of a man who helped steer the city through some of its hardest challenges. George Farkouh was a legendary community leader. Born in Palestine and having spent his early years in Beirut and Lebanon, he and his family moved to Canada in 1959, settling in Elliot Lake.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7961441" data-originallang="en">While George and his wife Louise started their careers in Toronto, they eventually returned to Elliot Lake, where George became a pillar of the business community as owner of Algoma Chrysler.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7961442" data-originallang="en"> George was elected mayor of Elliot Lake in 1988 and led the city for a remarkable 17 years. His days as mayor were not easy. The closing of the uranium mines in the early 1990s had a major impact on the local economy, but George saw a path to pivot the city from mining to retirement community. He created an economic model transition that allowed it not only to survive but to thrive. It is a model that other cities going through a major economic shift can look to for guidance.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7961443" data-originallang="en">I, along with all Elliot Lakers, owe George a debt of gratitude. May he rest in peace.</p>
