<p data-HoCid="7655473" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, again, from Conservative speaker after Conservative speaker, we are getting conspiracy theories and dog whistle politics. Does the hon. member truly believe that three parties in the House would support a piece of legislation and that none of those members would raise concerns about being brought in line with countries like North Korea and Russia? I asked the previous member this. Is it not an insult to the people living in those regimes to even come close to comparing them?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7655474" data-originallang="en">I know the hon. member was not at committee and did not hear this. Could he name just one constitutional expert in this country who has raised concerns about it? No one has, yet they point fingers, yell and scream. They are yelling down the Twitter rabbit hole, hoping it yells back at them with money, over complete misinformation and disinformation about Bill <a data-HoCid="11528728" href="/bills/44-1/C-11/" title="An Act to amend the Broadcasting Act and to make related and consequential amendments to other Acts">C-11</a>. Can the hon. member name one constitutional expert?</p>
