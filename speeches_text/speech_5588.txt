<p data-HoCid="8720562" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, today is a tremendous day in the House of Commons. Why is it? It is because we are giving a tax break to Canadians so they can buy essential things like groceries, snacks, kids' clothing, kids' boots and diapers, all tax-free. It means the same, starting on December 14, for buying beer or wine to enjoy with one's friends or family. Going to a restaurant and grabbing some takeout will also be tax-free for the holidays.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8720563" data-originallang="en">The best question that the Conservative member can ask his <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">leader</a> is whether this time he will be unmuzzled and unleashed to actually vote for an affordability measure in the chamber.</p>
