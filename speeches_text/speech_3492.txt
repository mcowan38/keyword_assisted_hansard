<p data-HoCid="8220293" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8220294" data-originallang="en">I want to add to it:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8220295" data-originallang="en"> That, pursuant to Standing Order 108(2), the committee invite the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and department officials, and Global Affairs Canada officials, to appear before the committee as soon as possible for two hours and have officials for an additional hour following the minister's appearance, to update the committee on the temporary immigration measures initiated in response to the ongoing conflicts in Sudan and Gaza. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8220296" data-originallang="en">I added “and Global Affairs Canada officials” because IRCC and Global Affairs work hand in hand on the ground. They are doing amazing work, but they face many challenges. The committee would benefit by learning from them what sort of challenges they face.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8220297" data-originallang="en">I think it would be good to learn about that and bring forward a report on this issue. </p>
