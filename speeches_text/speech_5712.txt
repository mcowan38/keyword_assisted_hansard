<p data-HoCid="8784192" data-originallang="fr">I completely agree with you. No form of racism is tolerable, acceptable or less serious than any other. On that note, we completely agree. However, I still feel uncomfortable when I hear, for example, that shots were fired on a Jewish school in Montreal. I have a lot of difficulty hearing about demonstrations in residential areas known for having a high Jewish population in Toronto or Montreal. I'm trying to find similar anti-Palestinian or pro-Israel incidents, for example, in other kinds of neighbourhoods.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8784193" data-originallang="fr">I come back to what you said in your opening statement. We hear that Hamas is being glorified at demonstrations and that really upsets me because I know that most people who demonstrate go with good intentions. They aren't taking part in them because they have hostile intentions towards Jews, they're going to condemn a situation they find very troubling. Those rallies are all too often plagued by extremist groups or troublemakers. The police seem to find it very difficult to control that, but society also seems to believe that propaganda, which is quite unhealthy, if we want to hold a fair debate on the fight against intolerance and racism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8784194" data-originallang="fr">Do you think that some police forces are doing their job with less rigour than others? We've heard criticism about the Montreal police, following demonstrations at the convention centre last week. In Toronto too, the police are heavily criticized. The Quebec City police went out of their way, this week, to tell people not to demonstrate because they would be arrested.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8784195" data-originallang="fr">If it's that easy, do you think it's because the Montreal and Toronto police forces are slacking on the job a little?</p>
