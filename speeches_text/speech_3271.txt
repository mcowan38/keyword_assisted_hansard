<p data-HoCid="8131609" data-originallang="en">On a point of order, Mr. Chair, I apologize to my colleague Mr. Small. That wasn't intended to be a personal attack in any way. I'm just trying to get clarification, so that we're all on the same page.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8131610" data-originallang="en">Are we speaking only to the amendments that were put forward to this motion? It sounds like we've gone down the rabbit hole of debating the content of the original motion that was brought forward, which is a debate that I one hundred per cent want to participate in but have not, because we are amending the three points that have been brought forward by Mr. Kelloway on the content of the motion. The “minimize” to “eliminate”, the “west coast” and then the request to the government are the three points I heard and that I spoke to.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8131611" data-originallang="en">I'm happy to hear from Mr. Small, of course, but I want to make sure we're all debating the same thing right now.</p>
