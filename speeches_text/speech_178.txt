<p data-HoCid="6095656" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honour of International Women's Day to honour my mother, who instilled in me the values of justice and empathy which set my moral compass, and to honour my incredible spouse, who teaches me the virtues of patience and compassion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6095657" data-originallang="en">I rise to honour all of Hamilton's incredible Women of Distinction, those who have officially been nominated and those who continue to lead and yet remain unrecognized.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6095658" data-originallang="en">I stand in solidarity with all women around the world on the front lines against violent oppression; indigenous women land and water protectors here in Canada; Latinas mass organizing against gender-based violence in places like Mexico and Chile; women fighting for basic human rights in Saudi Arabia; women on the front lines against ethnic cleansing in India and occupation in Palestine; and the young women and girls internationally calling for access to education, the end of female genital mutilation and the end to girls being exploited through marriage.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6095659" data-originallang="en">I rise to honour them in their ongoing struggles for justice, security and equity.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6095660" data-originallang="en">May their courage become ours and their struggles shared in solidarity until their day is won.</p>
