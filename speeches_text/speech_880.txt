<p data-HoCid="6626363" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I had the pleasure of serving on the HUMA committee with my colleague from <a data-HoCid="253019" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>. I hope that she is doing well. Unfortunately, we have never had a federal New Democratic Party government, so I would not be able to comment on its performance, had it ever occurred in Canadian history.</p>
