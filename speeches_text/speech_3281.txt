<p data-HoCid="8122382" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, MP Zahid, for that and for your advocacy. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8122383" data-originallang="en">First and foremost, as we continue to see with shock and horror the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, I think that our policies do need to evolve. Despite our best intentions, we do face some very challenging realities on the ground in getting people out at the Rafah gates. That reflects the war. It reflects security concerns of partners on the ground that make it very challenging to get even the narrow categories that we have out and to safety. That includes Canadians, permanent residents and the categories you enumerated.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8122384" data-originallang="en">At the same time, we have been flexible and been advocating for them to make sure that people who don't fall into those categories do and are able to get out, but it isn't a sure shot by any stretch of the imagination. I am looking currently within my department at options to expand that policy, but it is one that is conditioned by a number of considerations, particularly ones related to security and our effective ability to extract people from a war zone.</p>
