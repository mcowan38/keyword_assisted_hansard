<p data-HoCid="6627676" data-originallang="en"> Ms. Gazan, thanks for the question. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6627677" data-originallang="en">There is no question that we operate from our chiefs-in-assembly mandate, and I indicated earlier that when Bill <a data-HoCid="8160636" href="/bills/42-1/C-262/" title="An Act to ensure that the laws of Canada are in harmony with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">C-262</a> was not passed in the Senate, our chiefs met in assembly and said “National chiefs, AFN, go get a government bill that's as strong as, or better than, Bill C-262.” That is what Bill <a data-HoCid="11007812" href="/bills/43-2/C-15/" title="An Act respecting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">C-15</a> represents. It is a bill that is as strong or better. Part of that dialogue and support for Bill C-262 was the eventual hope to see it in legislation, so that carries through to Bill C-15. We have numerous resolutions of support for the UN declaration itself, as well as for legislation going forward. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6627678" data-originallang="en">There are a lot of people—and it's first nations politics as well—some who like it and some who don't. Some will say, “Oh, the national chief should not be saying this; he doesn't have a mandate.” We do have a mandate, and because of that mandate we are pushing very hard for this and it's an opportunity that we don't want to lose. That's my response to the question. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6627679" data-originallang="en">It's a very good question. We have a resolution by our AFN chiefs-in-assembly, and that's what we're building on and implementing. </p>
