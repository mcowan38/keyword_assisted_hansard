<p data-HoCid="6656017" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6656018" data-originallang="en">I definitely appreciate everyone's comments here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6656019" data-originallang="en">I think Ms. Gazan's suggestion is quite reasonable. Right now I think <a data-HoCid="233806" href="/politicians/carolyn-bennett/" title="Carolyn Bennett">Minister Bennett</a> has already read the statement that <a data-HoCid="253705" href="/politicians/david-lametti/" title="David Lametti">Minister Lametti</a> was supposed to present today. I propose the opportunity for questions, and given the makeup of this committee, we'd have five questions for the Conservatives, five for the Liberals, four for the Bloc and four for the NDP, with a response deadline of five o'clock tomorrow. The information could then be presented and accepted as formal submissions to this committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6656020" data-originallang="en">It's fair to say that <a data-HoCid="245291" href="/politicians/david-lametti/" title="David Lametti">Minister Lametti</a> regrets not being here. He's been very engaged on this file. We've had a number of discussions over the past several weeks, and I know he regrets not being here. I think it's important and imperative that the information provided by our witnesses today, which has been exhaustive.... If further clarifications are needed, the suggestion that Ms. Gazan made, with minor modifications, would and should suffice to ensure that the minister's comments are on the record. </p>
