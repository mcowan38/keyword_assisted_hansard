<p data-HoCid="8300729" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Chair, and members of the Committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300730" data-originallang="fr">Thank you for inviting me to join you today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300731" data-originallang="fr">I would like to begin by acknowledging that we are meeting on the traditional unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinaabe Nation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300732" data-originallang="fr">As I am sure you have seen, a few weeks ago, I introduced Bill <a data-HoCid="12913297" href="/bills/44-1/C-63/" title="An Act to enact the Online Harms Act, to amend the Criminal Code, the Canadian Human Rights Act and An Act respecting the mandatory reporting of Internet child pornography by persons who provide an Internet service and to make consequential and related amendments to other Acts">C‑63</a>, the Online Harms Act. I want to both explain the vital importance of the Online Harms Act and dispel misunderstandings about what it does and doesn't do.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300733" data-originallang="fr">The premise of this legislation is simple: we all expect to be safe in our homes, neighbourhoods and communities. We should be able to expect the same kind of security in our online communities. We need to address the online harms that threaten us, and especially our children, every day.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300734" data-originallang="fr">Let me start by talking about our children.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300735" data-originallang="en"> There are currently no safety standards mandated for the online platforms that kids use every day. In contrast, my children's LEGO in our basement is subject to rigorous safety standards and testing before my two boys get their hands on it. I know that these days my children spend much more time online than playing with their LEGO. The most dangerous toys in my home right now and in every Canadian home are the screens our children are on. Social media is everywhere. It brings unchecked dangers and horrific content. This, frankly, terrifies me. We need to make the Internet safe for our young people around the country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300736" data-originallang="en">As parents, one of the first things we teach all of our kids is how to cross the road. We tell them to wait for the green light. We tell them to look in both directions. We trust our children, but we also have faith in the rules of the road and that drivers will respect the rules of the road. We trust that cars will stop at a red light and obey the speed limit. Safety depends on a basic network of trust. This is exactly what we are desperately lacking in the digital world. The proposed <a data-HoCid="12913297" href="/bills/44-1/C-63/" title="An Act to enact the Online Harms Act, to amend the Criminal Code, the Canadian Human Rights Act and An Act respecting the mandatory reporting of Internet child pornography by persons who provide an Internet service and to make consequential and related amendments to other Acts">online harms act</a> would establish rules of the road for platforms so that we can teach our kids to be safe online, with the knowledge that platforms are also doing their part.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300737" data-originallang="fr">Now, let's talk about hate crimes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300738" data-originallang="fr">The total number of police-reported hate crimes in Canada has reached its highest level on record, nearly doubling the rate recorded in 2019.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300739" data-originallang="en">Police across the country are calling the increase “staggering”. Toronto Police Chief Myron Demkiw said this week that hate crime calls in Toronto have increased by 93% since last October. Communities and law enforcement have been calling on governments to act.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300740" data-originallang="en">Bill <a data-HoCid="12913297" href="/bills/44-1/C-63/" title="An Act to enact the Online Harms Act, to amend the Criminal Code, the Canadian Human Rights Act and An Act respecting the mandatory reporting of Internet child pornography by persons who provide an Internet service and to make consequential and related amendments to other Acts">C-63</a> creates a new stand-alone hate crime offence to make sure that hate crimes are properly prosecuted and identified. Under our current legal system, hate motivation for a crime is only considered as an afterthought at the sentencing stage; it is not part of the offence-laying itself. The threshold for criminal hatred is high. Comments that offend, humiliate or insult do not hit the standard of hatred. They are what we call awful but lawful. The definition of hate that we are embedding in the Criminal Code comes straight from the Supreme Court of Canada in the Keegstra and Whatcott decisions. We did not make up the definition of hatred that we are proposing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300741" data-originallang="en">It has been disappointing, though not surprising, to see the wildly inaccurate assertions made by some commentators about how sentencing for this new hate crime provision would work. I have heard some claim that, under this provision, someone who commits an offence under the National Parks Act would now be subject to a life sentence. That is simply false.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300742" data-originallang="en">In Canada, judges impose sentences following sentencing ranges established through past decisions. Judges are required by law—and every member of this committee who is a lawyer will know this—to impose sentences that are proportionate to the offence committed. In other words, the punishment must always fit the crime. If judges impose sentences that are unfit, we have appeal courts that can overturn those sentences.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300743" data-originallang="en">You may be asking, “Well, why not specify that, Minister? Why put a maximum sentence of life in the new hate crime offence-laying provision?”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300744" data-originallang="en"> Let me explain.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300745" data-originallang="en">First, it's important to remember that a maximum sentence is not an average sentence; it's an absolute ceiling.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300746" data-originallang="en">Second, the new hate crime offence captures any existing offence if it was hate-motivated. That can run the gamut from a hate-motivated theft all the way to a hate-motivated attempted murder. The sentencing range entrenched in Bill <a data-HoCid="12913297" href="/bills/44-1/C-63/" title="An Act to enact the Online Harms Act, to amend the Criminal Code, the Canadian Human Rights Act and An Act respecting the mandatory reporting of Internet child pornography by persons who provide an Internet service and to make consequential and related amendments to other Acts">C-63</a> was designed to mirror the existing sentencing options for all of these potential underlying offences, from the most minor to the most serious offences on the books, such as attempted murder, which can attract, right now, a life sentence.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300747" data-originallang="fr">This does not mean that minor offences will suddenly receive extremely harsh sentences. This would violate all the legal principles that sentencing judges are required to follow. Hate-motivated murder will result in a life sentence. A minor infraction will certainly not result in it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300748" data-originallang="fr">Another criticism I have heard is that this bill could stifle freedom of expression. This is simply not true. On the contrary, this bill strengthens freedom of expression. There are people in Canada who cannot speak out because they legitimately fear for their safety. When they speak out, they are mistreated and subjected to truly despicable threats, intimidation and harassment.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300749" data-originallang="en"> This is carefully balanced. We consulted. We looked abroad.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300750" data-originallang="en">We do not automatically take down material within 24 hours except for child sexual abuse material or revenge pornography. We do not touch private communications. We do not affect individual websites that do not host user-generated content.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300751" data-originallang="fr">This bill protects children and gives everyone the tools they need to protect themselves online. We do not tolerate hate speech in the public square. Nor must we tolerate hate speech online.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300752" data-originallang="fr">We have seen the consequences of unchecked online hate and child sexual exploitation. Ask the families of the six people killed at the Quebec City mosque by someone who was radicalized online.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300753" data-originallang="en">Ask the young boy orphaned by the horrific attack on four members of the Afzaal family in London, Ontario. Ask the parents of young people right across this country who have taken their own lives after being sextorted by online predators.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300754" data-originallang="en">Finally, let me set the record straight on the peace bond provision in Bill <a data-HoCid="12913297" href="/bills/44-1/C-63/" title="An Act to enact the Online Harms Act, to amend the Criminal Code, the Canadian Human Rights Act and An Act respecting the mandatory reporting of Internet child pornography by persons who provide an Internet service and to make consequential and related amendments to other Acts">C-63</a>. Peace bonds are not house arrests. Peace bonds are not punishments. Peace bonds are well-established tools used to impose individually tailored conditions on someone when there is credible evidence to show that they may hurt someone or commit a crime. The proposed peace bond here would operate very similarly to existing peace bonds.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300755" data-originallang="en">As an example, if someone posts online about their plan to deface or attack a synagogue to intimidate the Jewish community, members of the synagogue could take this information to the police and the court. They could seek to have a peace bond imposed after obtaining consent from the provincial attorney general. Decades of case law tell us that conditions must be reasonable and linked to the specific threat. Here conditions imposed on the person could include staying 100 metres away from that synagogue for a period of 12 months. If the person breached that simple condition, they could be arrested. If they abided by the conditions, they would face no consequences.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300756" data-originallang="en">I ask you this: Why should members of that synagogue, when facing a credible threat of being targeted by a hate-motivated crime, have to wait to be attacked or to have a swastika graffitied on the front door before we act to help them? If we can prevent some attacks from happening, isn't that much better? Peace bonds are not perfect, but we believe they can be a valuable tool to keep people safe. In the face of rising hate crime, our government believes that doing nothing in an instance like this would be irresponsible.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300757" data-originallang="en">I think that's what explains both CIJA's and the special envoy on anti-Semitism's support of Bill <a data-HoCid="12913297" href="/bills/44-1/C-63/" title="An Act to enact the Online Harms Act, to amend the Criminal Code, the Canadian Human Rights Act and An Act respecting the mandatory reporting of Internet child pornography by persons who provide an Internet service and to make consequential and related amendments to other Acts">C-63</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300758" data-originallang="fr">As always, I am open to good faith suggestions to improve this legislation. My goal is to get it right. I look forward to debating the Online Harms Act in the House of Commons and following the committee's process as it reaches that stage. I am convinced that we all have the same goal here: we need to create a safe online world, especially for the most vulnerable members of our society—our children.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300759" data-originallang="en">Thank you for your time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300760" data-originallang="en">I'm happy to take your questions.</p>
