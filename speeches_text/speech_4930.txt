<p data-HoCid="8576851" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, one issue had to do with a number of Jewish community buildings this year, including in Montreal in my own riding, where people gathered around the buildings, screaming hateful things and blocking access to or exit from them. That was totally unacceptable.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576852" data-originallang="en">Municipalities and provinces can do a better job of controlling that by passing zoning bylaws at the municipal level, or laws at the provincial level, setting out safety perimeters.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576853" data-originallang="en">We cannot do that, but what we can do federally would be to amend the Criminal Code to create an intimidation offence that says a very specific Criminal Code infraction will be levied against any person who blocks access to, or exit from, one of these buildings. That would make it easier for the police to use a very simple tool to stop that from happening.</p>
