<p data-HoCid="8057314" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, the reason Ukraine has had that price on pollution since 2011 is that in order to get into the European market, which it had been trying to do for so long, the European market required that it have a price on pollution in order to stay competitive. That is why Ukraine had it. This incredible red herring that we are hearing recently from the Conservatives is nothing more than just that, a red herring.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8057315" data-originallang="en">The reality is that there is a faction within the Conservative Party of Canada. Some of the MPs over there have gone down the rabbit hole of alt-right-wing American politics. Now we are seeing that come out. I kind of always suspected it, because we have been seeing it happen over the last number of years, but I did not realize that this faction actually had a stranglehold on the party.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8057316" data-originallang="en">It is very likely that the <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">Leader of the Opposition</a> is part of that, given everything that he has done. Let us go back to the YouTube meta tags.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8057317" data-originallang="en">If members want to understand the <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">Leader of the Opposition</a>'s support for Ukraine, they should just look at his social media posts from when President Zelenskyy visited us in September. He did not tweet about it. He did not put anything on Facebook about it. He did not put anything on Instagram about it. He was completely silent. He never said a word about Zelenskyy's visit.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8057318" data-originallang="en">The irony is that he did say a word about Zelenskyy appearing before this Parliament when he came a year earlier, when he came by video conference. He actually tweeted, at that time, in 2022, how proud he was to see President Zelenskyy appear before Parliament.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8057319" data-originallang="en">Do members know what the member for <a data-HoCid="278248" href="/politicians/michelle-rempel/" title="Michelle Rempel">Calgary Nose Hill</a> did? I do not know if a lot of people caught this, but it was almost a little subtle act of defiance. Do members know what she did? When he came this year in 2023, she quote tweeted his tweet from a year ago, congratulating him on coming. That was clearly a dig at the <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">Leader of the Opposition</a> because she recognized how silent he was on it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8057320" data-originallang="en">The member for <a data-HoCid="278158" href="/politicians/james-bezan/" title="James Bezan">Selkirk—Interlake—Eastman</a> and all Conservatives can stand up and preach to me all they want about how much they support Ukraine, but their actions speak louder than words. They are silent when the president comes here. They are silent when it came to determining what they were going to say on the Ukraine free trade deal, and then they voted against it.</p>
