<p data-HoCid="7850582" data-originallang="en"> Yes. There's concern for my fellow colleagues here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7850583" data-originallang="en">Now, I just feel that we're getting.... First of all, we were asking for unredacted records of tax returns of a charitable foundation, and now we're asking in this latest motion that Mr. Genuis has put forward to authorize the chair to summon witnesses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7850584" data-originallang="en">Again, we've never done that. We invite witnesses. We encourage witnesses. We, hopefully, compel them to comply. I just feel that summoning witnesses goes beyond what we have historically done. I just don't see how summoning someone would add to what we're supposed to be doingâ€”as I've said, reviewing Auditor General's reports. We seem to be getting further away all the time. At every meeting, we're straying from our mandate and what we're supposed to accomplish. Meanwhile, some of the things we've worked on for weeks may not even make it to the House and get tabled because we're going down other rabbit holes or branches.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7850585" data-originallang="en">That's my feeling. I just think this is inappropriate, both in context and in approach.</p>
