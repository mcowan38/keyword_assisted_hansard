<p data-HoCid="7234345" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, in the second petition, the petitioners are noting the Government of Israel's designation of six prominent Palestinian human rights and civil society groups as terrorist organizations on October 19, 2021. They are concerned that the six prominent Palestinian human rights and civil society organizations in question are being criminalized for critical human rights work. They point to Canada's own guidelines on supporting human rights defenders, which state that the commitment of Canada and Canada's diplomatic mission is to advocate for human rights defenders and protect them from harm.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7234346" data-originallang="en">They are therefore calling on the government to take concrete action against the Israeli occupation authorities' continued harassment and criminalization of Palestinian human rights defenders and civil society organizations, by calling for full revocation of the designation and publicly calling on Israeli authorities to immediately end efforts aimed at prosecuting, delegitimizing and criminalizing Palestinian human rights defenders and civil society organizations. Finally, they call on relevant cabinet ministers, policy-makers and members of Parliament to meet with the six Palestinian organizations.</p>
