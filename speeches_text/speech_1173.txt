<p data-HoCid="6814090" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6814091" data-originallang="en">I would agree with most of what Mr. Lightbound said. Yes, we have heard, in recent weeks, in fact, about the climate of fear in the Jewish community in Canada, voiced publicly as a result of recent events and the rise of anti-Semitic acts. We have also heard clearly, since the events in London, an expression of real fear from the Muslim community and a call for action to get results.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6814092" data-originallang="en">I support the idea of having a 90-minute session where each of those groups could express their concerns and also offer specific recommendations regarding solutions and concrete actions. Half an hour may well be enough, if some thought is given to it advance, to craft a motion that would be referred to the House. I think we can do that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6814093" data-originallang="en">However, there are several other motions before this committee that have to do with ongoing studies. One is in relation to the Bastarache report, for which a notice of motion has been given. There's also a notice of motion that I think went in today with respect to the Levesque study. There's also the motion I put forward. I gave the notice of motion regarding the study we were actually supposed to be starting today. That seems to be have been forgotten about, despite the fact that we have witnesses waiting.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6814094" data-originallang="en">I don't think we're being fair to the balance of our calendar. I would point out that three days were offered for the CSC study, which is of great importance and on which we have five witnesses waiting to talk today. I don't think we can ignore that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6814095" data-originallang="en">There's a suggested method for dealing with the Levesque study that we can debate, and we may pass a version of that so we can complete that study.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6814096" data-originallang="en">If we were going to interrupt our schedule with respect to the Levesque study, I would prefer that we still try to complete that and to do that, potentially, by considering those motions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6814097" data-originallang="en"> Also, with respect to the border study, which I think was of great interest to Madam Michaud, instead of starting something we haven't even begun.... I don't know if there's still the same level of interest on that point. However, there is a lot of interest in the Bastarache report and the motion before the committee. There's interest in the CSC study and there are witnesses waiting to testify. As well, there is a proposal, I believe, from the Conservatives as to how to deal with the Levesque report. I think we should deal with those next week, as well.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6814098" data-originallang="en"> I'm not in favour of Mr. Lightbound's amendment if it deals with only one aspect of what's before us.</p>
