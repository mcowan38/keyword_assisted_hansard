<p data-HoCid="8338030" data-originallang="en">That's a great question, Mr. Garrison.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8338031" data-originallang="en">First off is the science. We've seen numerous studies—75 in the last 20 years—that have clearly indicated the negative impact of using physical force against children. That's the first evolution.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8338032" data-originallang="en">Second is the number of countries around the world. There was only a handful in 2004. There are now over 65, plus 18 regions, including Wales and Scotland. These are our allies. These are fellow democracies that are all making the same decision. There's the decision of the Supreme Court of Italy and the decision of the Supreme Court of Israel. These are all indicators that are very clear and compelling, and 700 organizations—all the major health organizations and all the major organizations that work with children—have called upon Parliament to take this step and repeal section 43.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8338033" data-originallang="en">What has changed is the groundswell of support, the science and the international evolution of thoughts about the best way to ensure the development of our children and youth. All those things have changed since that split decision.</p>
