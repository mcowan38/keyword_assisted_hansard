<p data-HoCid="8592348" data-originallang="en"> The only thing I will follow up on from Mr. Chong's comments is that the state of Palestine exists. It already exists. What we are talking about here is the recognition from the Canadian government of that state. For him to bring forward the argument that there needs to be an agreement by Israel for Palestine to exist is actually factually incorrect. In fact, when you have a partner like Israel right now saying that they will not negotiate, that can hardly be a rationale for us to move forward as a country. </p>
