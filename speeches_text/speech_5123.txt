<p data-HoCid="8667633" data-originallang="en">I'll direct my next couple of questions to Meta, if that's okay.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8667634" data-originallang="en">Ms. Curran, on December 20, 2023, there was a Human Rights Watch report entitled “Meta: Systemic Censorship of Palestine Content”. Hundreds of Palestinian users have reported being shadow-banned or having their accounts suspended without any explanation. Does Meta acknowledge this as a form of censorship that deprives people in support of Palestinians' plight of their fundamental rights to express their opinions online?</p>
