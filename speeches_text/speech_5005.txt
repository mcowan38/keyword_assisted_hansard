<p data-HoCid="8628474" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8628475" data-originallang="en">Through you to the minister, thank you for being here today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8628476" data-originallang="en">Mr. Jivani spoke about what's on Twitter, so let's talk about a few things that are also on Twitter.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8628477" data-originallang="en">We've talked a lot here, from all colleagues, about the increasing rise in anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. Certainly Holocaust denialism is something I have never seen before like this. When members of the Conservative Party dine with German politicians who actually, within their party, believe the Holocaust was a hoax.... I wonder if Conservatives, who care a lot about what happens on Twitter, posting and amplifying hateful rhetoric toward the Jewish community and still sit in the front row of Conservative benches.... There has been no retribution or reprimand for promoting people who share hateful Holocaust denialism. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8628478" data-originallang="en">I wonder if you think that is helpful in the reduction of the anti-Semitic hate we're seeing in this country. </p>
