<p data-HoCid="6813933" data-originallang="en">My riding has a very high concentration of Jewish and Muslim Canadians. Both groups are living in fear right now because of events that occurred in Montreal a couple of weeks ago, anti-Semitic events that happened, and now because of the London event that took place. People are afraid to walk in the streets alone. People are having their windows broken if they have a certain flag or a certain sign on their door. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6813934" data-originallang="en">I definitely think this is a pressing matter right now especially. I feel that it definitely deserves the attention of this committee.</p>
