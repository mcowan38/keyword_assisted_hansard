<p data-HoCid="8702942" data-originallang="en"> I think we all agree that Israel has a right to defend itself from the terrorist attack on October 7. However, we also see the horrible humanitarian situation in Gaza. Most of us believe.... Why do we want to condemn generations of children to hate and fear, over all of these years?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8702943" data-originallang="en"> Canada has always supported a two-state solution, and I'm hearing from many of you that this is important. I would like to know, if somebody could tell me—Mr. Fogel, for instance—why it has been 75 years since this was first suggested. It has not happened. What are the challenges? What are the barriers to this? We've had Shimon Peres. We've had Olmert. We've had a lot of people who supported it and wanted it. We had Oslo doing this. What is the reason it has never come to pass? </p>
