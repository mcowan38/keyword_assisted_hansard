<p data-HoCid="6920107" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to table today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6920108" data-originallang="en">First, over 1,500 Canadians have signed a petition raising concerns about Israel's designation of six leading Palestinian civil society organizations as terrorist organizations. They note the concerns raised by the UN special rapporteurs condemning the designation, and they call on the Government of Canada to call upon Israeli authorities to immediately rescind the designations and to end all efforts aimed at delegitimizing and criminalizing Palestinian human rights defenders.</p>
