<p data-HoCid="6791769" data-originallang="en">I think these normalization agreements are indicative of changing attitudes in the region. We see growing ties between Israel and a number of countries, such as UAE and Morocco. Even with Saudi Arabia, the interactions have increased. I think this is a very positive thing, one that we have welcomed. Collectively, there is a joint concern about terrorism and about Iranian intentions in the region. I think we would welcome, and we do welcome, the normalization agreements and hope that this can build foundations for a more peaceful circumstance and a more peaceful environment. We'd like to support them where we can.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791770" data-originallang="en">In terms of the recent conflict, of course, what we'll talk about today is that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is really a core issue for a number of countries in the region. This is difficult when you're having countries build ties together, but hopefully, with the ceasefire, we can reinforce it and move to a more positive environment.</p>
