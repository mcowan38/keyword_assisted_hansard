<p data-HoCid="6814118" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, I briefly wanted to comment on Mr. Motz's comments and echo what both JoÃ«l and Pam said. I think it's important to recognize the role that this committee and its members play.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6814119" data-originallang="en">Government certainly has a job to do, and government has taken action on listing the terrorist groups, and is taking action but, as Pam said, what we saw yesterday was all parties coming together at the vigil and saying that we must work together. We already have a study before us where we were studying IMVE. We heard just the week before from witnesses about this climate of hate and the rise of Islamophobia and anti-Semitism. Committees have a role to play in listening to these groups, as this is the most important threat right now to Canada, as we heard.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6814120" data-originallang="en">I think it's truly incumbent upon all of us to hear from these groups, give them the space that's needed, and make recommendations to the government before the House rises. I just don't understand, Mr. Chair, why we are even debating this. I really thought there would have been unanimous support on this motion. It's not a new study. It's something that we're already studying. I just hope that we can get it done.</p>
