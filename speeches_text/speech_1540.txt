<p data-HoCid="7072073" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, Passover, or Pesach, is one of the oldest and most transformative stories of hope. It tells how a powerless people found their way from slavery to freedom through faith and perseverance to become a nation. The story of the Exodus is defining for Jews around the world and a living symbol for communities of hope against adversity. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7072074" data-originallang="en">As Jewish families and communities across Canada gather next Friday, we will be celebrating Passover with family for the first time in two long years. This year, with Ukraine and its Jewish communities fighting for their freedom and their lives, the story of Passover takes on new meaning in this holiday of spring and renewal.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7072075" data-originallang="en">We retell the Passover story every year to remind ourselves that freedoms are never fully won and can never be taken for granted. We must fight for them and cherish them in every generation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7072076" data-originallang="en">On behalf of my family, I wish the Jewish community of York Centre and those across Canada <em>chag pesach sameach</em>.</p>
