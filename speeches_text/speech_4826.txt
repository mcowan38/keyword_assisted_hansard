<p data-HoCid="8576952" data-originallang="en"> Madam Speaker, so many Lebanese Canadians are watching what is happening, and when I spoke to some this afternoon, they were telling me how horrified they were that there were components and military goods still being shipped from Canada. There is still a need for an arms embargo on Israel so that those weapons cannot be used against innocent civilians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576953" data-originallang="en">I believe the member wants to stop the bloodshed, stop the war and work toward peace. However, the <a data-HoCid="278529" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="MÃ©lanie Joly">minister</a> has promised an arms embargo, yet she has still not made public a notice to arms exporters. I am wondering when Lebanese Canadians and all Canadians can expect to see that posted. It should take about 30 seconds for the minister to put that online.</p>
