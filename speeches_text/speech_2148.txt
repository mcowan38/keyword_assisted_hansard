<p data-HoCid="7640414" data-originallang="fr">I don't know whether you've heard about it on the news, but the government recently announced the creation of the Canada Innovation Corporation. Someone came up with the idea of applying a recovery measure, or a tax, when the intellectual property of a Canadian firm is sold outside the country. For example, when Waze, an Israeli entity, was sold to Google, the Israeli government pocketed approximately US$360 million for the technology transfer.</p>
