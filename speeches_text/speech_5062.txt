<p data-HoCid="8642314" data-originallang="en">I think one of the challenges today is that so much of our public discourse is happening on social media platforms that are owned by a handful of billionaires, and their primary motive is to make more money for themselves. Not everyone's voice is equal on social media. It's not like all of us gathering in a town square. We know that some voices are amplified over others and that algorithms push people down certain rabbit holes. For many people, it's still a mystery how that all happens. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8642315" data-originallang="en">I think this is a similar question and, really, the theme of the challenge before us: How does the Canadian government approach this problem without there being a perception of it censoring the Canadian public? How do we put in those tools to defend our democracy so that we can still have a free exchange of ideas, but without the corrupting influence of a foreign government that is seeking to undermine us?</p>
