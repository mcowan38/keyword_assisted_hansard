<p data-HoCid="8499298" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you to the witnesses for appearing before the committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8499299" data-originallang="en"> My question is for Dr. Zine. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8499300" data-originallang="en">Dr. Zine, I want to expand on intersectional Islamophobia. My colleague Ali Ehsassi asked a question, and you were expanding on that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8499301" data-originallang="en"> Your article last October, “How Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian racism are manufactured through disinformation”, examines some dark manifestations of Islamophobia. Could you expand on this and and your thinking on how widespread Islamophobic sentiments lead to tragedy and bad public policy?</p>
