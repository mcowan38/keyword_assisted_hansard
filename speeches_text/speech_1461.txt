<p data-HoCid="6965111" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I had the honour of travelling to Poland with the hon. member for the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We have seen anti-Semitic symbols flying in our nation's capital. Many of the organizers of the convoy are well-known far-right figures who are known for their white supremacist ideologies.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6965112" data-originallang="en">Can the member speak to the need to tackle anti-Semitism across the country and ensure that this kind of thing never happens again?</p>
