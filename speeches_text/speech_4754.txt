<p data-HoCid="8574288" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8574289" data-originallang="en">I'm going to move an amendment to this. I'll just read the entire motion, which begins as Mr. Shipley has put it on the record:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8574290" data-originallang="en"> Given that the RCMP have arrested an additional alleged ISIS terrorist, who was preparing to carry out a massacre targeting the Jewish community in New York City, the committee expand its Review of the Foiled Terrorist Plot in Toronto and of the Security Screening Process for Permanent Residence and Citizenship Application to include questions around this more recent arrest in its meetings. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8574291" data-originallang="en">I'd like to speak to my amendment.</p>
