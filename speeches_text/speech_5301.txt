<p data-HoCid="8693788" data-originallang="en">It is not a great moment in the sense that the timing following October 7 opens the move to a lot of questions. I think that is problematic. The idea itself of supporting the two-state solution, however, which is enshrined in the Canadian policy, remains valid.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693789" data-originallang="en">I do think there is a problem with the timing, in the sense that it does come really on the heels of something that opens up...especially if it's done exclusively as a recognition, but with no other action.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693790" data-originallang="en">The problem I see is that in the past several years, the Palestinian question has been completely on the back burner for everyone. One could travel, as you might have done, to Israel and not at all know that there is a Palestinian question that needs to be resolved. As someone who has observed this, you would think that this would have been maybe a better time to really try to build, and now the confidence between the two parties is at an all-time low. This is why I said that recognition alone, without any other more substantial plan, a move that is concerted, is a limited step.</p>
