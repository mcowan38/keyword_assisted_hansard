<p data-HoCid="8412270" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much. I appreciate that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412271" data-originallang="en">The motion put forward asks for a four-meeting study looking at extremism in Canada—in particular, far-right extremism in Canada—and the impact that has on some communities that have been selected here by the Liberal Party of Canada, including “journalists, women, indigenous peoples, Black and racialized communities, members of the 2SLGBTQI+ community and religious minorities”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412272" data-originallang="en">As you can see from this list, there many folks who are omitted. Among them, of course, would be the Jewish community in Canada, which is actually the most harassed community in our nation at the moment and has been for quite some time. If we look at the crime rate and the hate crimes that are committed against folks, certainly Jewish individuals are the most targeted. Therefore, I'm confused as to why they're not on this list.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412273" data-originallang="en">Nevertheless, the amendment we have moved here today calls for a two-meeting study. The reason for that is this: This committee is already undertaking quite a bit of work. The Liberal members have said again and again that their supposed priority is the safe sports study, yet they continue to move motions like the one we have in front of us, which take up time and take precedence over the safe sports study.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412274" data-originallang="en"> We spent quite a bit of time hearing from witnesses with regard to the impact that abuse in sport had on them. That report was drafted once and then some edits were made. Then it was redrafted. That second version is now in front of the committee and we're waiting to review it. That review is not scheduled for the next meeting, but the meeting after.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412275" data-originallang="en">Therefore, accepting this motion in front of us would actually delay that report further. As the Liberals have highlighted in the past—and I'm not sure if it was genuine or disingenuous, given the conversation today—that report is a priority for them and is of utmost importance, yet again they continue to put hurdles in front of the completion of that report. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8412276" data-originallang="en">That baffles me. I think it baffles a lot of other folks who took the time out of their busy schedules to come and testify here and share their stories with us concerning the impact that abuse in sport had on them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412277" data-originallang="en">Now this committee continues to delay and to not complete that report and get it into the hands of the public. I think that's unfortunate. I think that's a misuse of those individuals' time, energy and emotional investment. I think it's actually an abuse of their trust in this committee and our ability to get things done. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8412278" data-originallang="en">The safe sports study is meant to take precedence, after completing the bill that is in front of us, so I am confused as to why we wouldn't make that happen.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412279" data-originallang="en">Changing this study that has been proposed—to move it from four meetings to two meetings—would allow us to get on with the business of this committee, I guess, and to complete that report with regard to safe sport in Canada. This would be respectful of the witnesses who came and shared with us their testimony concerning their experiences within sport. It would be respectful of the members of this committee who have invested over two years in this study. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8412280" data-originallang="en">I will observe that there is only one permanent member of this committee at this table right now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412281" data-originallang="en">Therefore, to be respectful of those who have invested a great deal of time and energy and to be respectful of those witnesses who showed great vulnerability in sharing their stories with us, I do believe we should prioritize the completion of that report. That would require a shortening of the study that is being proposed here today by Mrs. Romanado by way of moving <a data-HoCid="300876" href="/politicians/taleeb-noormohamed/" title="Taleeb Noormohamed">Mr. Noormohamed</a>'s motion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8412282" data-originallang="en">Further to that, I would highlight to the committee that once the safe sport study has been completed and that report has been drafted, the next study on the docket has to do with online harms. That is a study having to do with women and girls, who have been subjected to immense harm online. For many, it's because images were taken of them without their consent and then plastered—</p>
