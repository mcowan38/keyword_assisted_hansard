<p data-HoCid="8679246" data-originallang="en">As I said, we're really not talking about two states right now. We're talking about the grave humanitarian situation in Gaza, where 90% of Gazans have left their homes and some 40,000 have been killed, according to reports. Without UNRWA to provide aid and humanitarian assistance, they will be in even more dire straits. It's absolutely not clear how any humanitarian assistance can be delivered without UNRWA on the ground. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679247" data-originallang="en">Whether or not you agree with UNRWA, and there have been criticisms of them, criticizing UNRWA for 12 employees who allegedly were part of a terrorist group is like wanting to shut down the New York police force because of 12 or 15 or 20 corrupt cops. There are 13,000 employees of UNRWA working around the Middle East. They are essential to delivering aid to millions of people. I do hope the Israeli government will consider the various pleas by governments around the world to reverse that decision. </p>
