<p data-HoCid="6711638" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Mr. Harris. This is a very important issue because it actually showcases the spread and the strength of a Kremlin disinformation campaign against Alexei Navalny and how seriously they are taking Alexei Navalny and his movement.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6711639" data-originallang="en">Actually, it was back in 2013 when Navalny ran for mayor of Moscow and they started to plant articles of disinformation against him in the western media. For instance, they posted an article. They paid for an article in the Jerusalem Post pertaining to him being anti-Semitic, which is quite funny because he was a guest of honour on my chuppah, and a lot of different stuff like that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6711640" data-originallang="en">This year's campaign was, of course, the most noticeable. It included attempts to undermine his credibility and the credibility of our movement on many different international platforms, including people impersonating me, contacting different national and international bodies such as the parliamentary assembly of OSCE and others, and also including disinformation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6711641" data-originallang="en">The case of Amnesty International was very remarkable because they succeeded in that case. They presented them with a number of falsely interpreted quotes or the statements that Alexei Navalny made in 2007 and later revoked and condemned them, but they managed to push this case through some of the original branches of Amnesty, which led them to their decision.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6711642" data-originallang="en">Now, fortunately, he has been in touch with them. They are campaigning strongly and we are very grateful to them. They are campaigning worldwide to protect him and to release him. It is my information that they will also soon reconsider their decision about Alexei's status as a prisoner of conscience. They told me just yesterday that they will issue a press release on May 12 after they have examined how a Russian disinformation campaign managed to influence them and how they were made victims of this disinformation campaign. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6711643" data-originallang="en">They will not only reinstate his status, but they will also issue a post-mortem, which I hope will be very interesting, of what happened and how it happened.</p>
