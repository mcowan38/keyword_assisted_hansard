<p data-HoCid="7506106" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7506107" data-originallang="fr">As democrats and human rights advocates, we are here to defend the rights of all people, whether they are Ukrainians, Uyghurs, Tibetans, or people in Hong Kong, but also the Palestinians, who are also under military occupation. Sometimes we would like to know if products are made in illegal Israeli settlements condemned by UN resolutions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7506108" data-originallang="fr">Ms. Murphy, how do we find out which products were made in Xinjiang province, possibly in forced labour camps, when we already have difficulty finding out which products were made in illegal Israeli settlements?</p>
