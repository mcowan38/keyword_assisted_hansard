<p data-HoCid="7426875" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Gattuso, I see that you are very conversant with this issue. We are not asking you to engage in politicking, but as a witness on the outside, you have a very clear understanding of the problem.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7426876" data-originallang="fr">Our objective is to listen to witnesses like you and write a report at the end of our study. What can you recommend to us? You have mentioned a few things. Are there other aspects that have not been addressed to which you would like to draw our attention, to provide guidance for our work?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7426877" data-originallang="en"> Is there a rabbit in the hat?</p>
