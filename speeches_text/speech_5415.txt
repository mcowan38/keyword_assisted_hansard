<p data-HoCid="8703070" data-originallang="en">I don't think that I framed it that way. I think what I said was that in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, Palestinian statehood is not an automatic entitlement and that there were expectations based on those two resolutions. Frankly, we can't cherry-pick; either we're committed to the UN or we're not. If we're committed to the UN, then we have to follow the formula that the UN put forward in order to achieve that end of Palestinian statehood.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703071" data-originallang="en">I think resolutions 242 and 338 recognize that Palestinians had an opportunity in 1947 for the absolute entitlement to statehood, had they accepted the partition plan. By virtue of having rejected it and having gone to war against the nascent Jewish state, they compromised their ability to acquire that right of statehood, and now they had to, frankly, earn it.</p>
