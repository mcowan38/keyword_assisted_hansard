<p data-HoCid="8643967" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, after nine years, the NDP-Liberal government has allowed anti-Jewish hate crimes to increase by 400%. Members of the Jewish community make up just 1% of Canada's population, but are the targets of 70% of all religiously motivated hate crimes in Canada. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8643968" data-originallang="en">Synagogues have been firebombed, Jewish schools have been shot at, Jewish-owned businesses have been vandalized and Jewish-founded hospitals have been barricaded. Calls for death to Jews are coming from radical Hamas-loving, Jew-hating, terrorist sympathizers on the streets in front of Jewish seniors' homes. Jewish Canadians did not ask to be targeted with acts of hate and violence, and this escalation of hate and fear is just not the Canadian way. Enough is enough. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8643969" data-originallang="en">When will the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> finally stand up for Jewish Canadians and take this disgusting rise in anti-Semitism seriously so that every Jew, no matter where they live, work and go to school, can live safe and free from hate? </p>
