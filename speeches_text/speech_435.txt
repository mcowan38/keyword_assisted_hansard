<p data-HoCid="6382752" data-originallang="en">Ambassador Rae, the motion today, which Canada supported, talks about the contiguity of all Palestinian territories. As you know, Canada recognizes four occupied territories, those being the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem. Is it the government's position that these territories should be contiguous to each other?</p>
