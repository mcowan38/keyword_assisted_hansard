<p data-HoCid="7259640" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, the last two years have been hard for many Canadians. As a mother, like many parents, I have had concerns about how my two daughters, among millions of kids across this country, have navigated their studies, their social connections and their emotional well-being. Our educators in schools large and small, from day care through high school, have nurtured and cared for our children, making sure they received not only the educational tools and resources they needed, but emotional and resilient support while navigating the challenges they faced. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7259641" data-originallang="en">This June has brought with it graduations from coast to coast to coast for students and the resumption of grad trips, which are part of the milestones of exploring our wonderful country. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7259642" data-originallang="en">Today, I and colleagues from across this House welcomed Netivot HaTorah middle school graduates to West Block to see and learn how their House and the democratic institutions we cherish work, and that the diversity of this place reflects our Canada. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7259643" data-originallang="en">As a mother, it is not every day that I get to welcome my kid into this place. I congratulate the graduates, including my daughter, Eden. Their future is bright and we are proud of all they have accomplished and all they will do in their future. </p>
