<p data-HoCid="8373547" data-originallang="fr">Madam Speaker, on April 16, we tabled budget 2024. The budget promotes a fair and inclusive economy, an economy for every generation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373548" data-originallang="en"> Pierrefonds—Dollard is a diverse riding, and as parliamentary secretary for diversity, inclusion and persons with disabilities, I am committed to advancing initiatives that promote inclusivity for all Canadians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373549" data-originallang="fr">Today I will talk about the impact of the budget on my riding.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373550" data-originallang="en">I will present how the budget promotes diversity and inclusion, how it addresses housing shortages and how it upholds international and humanitarian economic development.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373551" data-originallang="fr">The budget contributes to lowering the cost of living. Canada has a housing shortage. Our young people are also having a hard time buying a home. We are taking significant measures to address that. We are making housing more affordable for everyone. Budget 2024 seeks to use public lands. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8373552" data-originallang="en">We would create over three million new homes by 2031, and 250,000 of them would be on public property. In my own riding of Pierrefonds—Dollard, our government recently announced that we are building 393 homes or apartments by having a low-cost loan of $165 million. Those 393 homes represent a 1% increase in housing to the riding of Pierrefonds—Dollard. That is very important to address the housing crisis.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373553" data-originallang="en">I want to say that I am sharing my time with the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278697" href="/politicians/ryan-turnbull/" title="Ryan Turnbull">Whitby</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373554" data-originallang="en">Economists suggest that Canadians should not spend more than 30% of their income on housing costs. We are tackling this housing crisis. Since 2015, nearly two million Canadians have found homes through federal initiatives. This is important. Our government is addressing this issue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373555" data-originallang="en">Also, on inclusive mortgages, the well-being of Canadians is important. It is critical to our government. We are doing two key initiatives to this effect.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373556" data-originallang="en">The first is an inclusive and interest-free mortgage program. This program would allow Canadians of all backgrounds to enter the housing market. In particular, those of Muslim faith would have the chance to enter the market, whereas some did not in the past. This initiative would be open to all Canadians, regardless of background. It does look at the way in which mortgages are constructed to make it more inclusive. It is an important initiative in budget 2024.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373557" data-originallang="en">We are also dealing with the security infrastructure program, also known as SIP. Our country has <em>vivre-ensemble</em>. We live well together. We have people from all backgrounds and from all faiths. However, unfortunately, there is hate and discrimination, which sometimes leads to violence toward property. That is why our government has the security infrastructure program, which protects synagogues, mosques and different community centres, including churches and other institutions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373558" data-originallang="en">This is, again, being financed within budget 2024 and would help to promote <em>vivre-ensemble</em>, to promote togetherness and to protect the security of all Canadians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373559" data-originallang="en">Budget 2024 also addresses diversity and inclusion. In particular, we have $273 million, over six years, which would go to Canada's action plan to combat hate. This would directly support community outreach. It would address discrimination also. These investments are important to social cohesion. They promote equity within society. This new legislation would dismantle barriers and would promotes togetherness.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373560" data-originallang="en">Budget 2024 also announces a national food program. Over $1 billion, during five years, would help families in need. It would put food on the table. I remember, as a young person going to elementary school, I would receive a small milk carton. That was an aspect of a food program. We are committed to ensuring that all children, regardless of income, have food in their bellies so that they can learn well.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373561" data-originallang="en">This program, the national food program, would help 400,000 children to have food in their stomachs. It would help a family with two children to get groceries, which represents $800 per year.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373562" data-originallang="en">We also have the pharmacare initiative in budget 2024, which is critical. It would allocate $1.5 billion over the next five years to help people with diabetes pay for that medication and to help women who choose to use contraceptives to be able to have them. Those are important initiatives that our government is introducing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373563" data-originallang="en">Flooding also impacts my riding of Pierrefonds—Dollard. In 2017, we had devastating floods that ravaged our communities and that harmed families, and people lost their life savings.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373564" data-originallang="en">Again, in 2019, we had flooding, unfortunately. This budget would help to address those concerns. In particular, we are offering a low-cost national flood insurance program. This would help 1.5 million homeowners be insured into the future. This is important, not only for my riding, but also for many communities that face flooding across the country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8373565" data-originallang="en">I would like to give a shout-out to the Mayor of L'Île-Bizard—Sainte-Geneviève, Doug Hurley, and also to the Mayor of Pierrefonds-Roxboro, Jim Beis, for the important work they do to protect residents from flooding.</p>
