<p data-HoCid="8741976" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, what I have heard from the Jewish community is that they want those hostages released and to be able to bury their dead with dignity, which they have been denied for 13 months. Many of the hostages are still alive, from what we understand. They need to be released and they need to be released now. That is what needs to happen.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8741977" data-originallang="en">The NDP supported that GST tax cut yesterday, which amounts to breadcrumbs thrown on a few things decided by the Liberal government, which picked and chose what Canadians deserve a so-called tax break on, which is really just a trick because it is only a couple of weeks of some items not having a little bit of tax on them when what we need is a long-term tax cut. We need to axe the tax to give long-term relief, because if the Liberal government is going to stay in power until April and continue to raise these taxes, and it has committed to raising the carbon tax, we are going to see it go up to 61¢ a litre. That is the “nuclear winter” from, as the member for <a data-HoCid="278257" href="/politicians/kevin-lamoureux/" title="Kevin Lamoureux">Winnipeg North</a> shared with everyone, our <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">leader</a>'s smart comments on that. That is coming if the Liberals stay in power.</p>
