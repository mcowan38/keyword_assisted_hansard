<p data-HoCid="8140930" data-originallang="en">Very specifically, the shelters are full. Too often, people are turned away. I myself have seen situations where families have been turned away. People are fleeing violence, and because they are unable to secure shelter or housing, they are forced to return to the abuser. That is the reality, and in spite of the lift over the pandemic period, even after the fact we know that violence has actually gone up. If anything, there should be greater investments and not reduced investments. I would absolutely call on the government to look at that, and also to engage with my colleague <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Leah Gazan</a>, who is very active on this issue. We need the government to take action, because literally people's lives hang in the balance.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8140931" data-originallang="en">I want to ask a question with respect to the federal lands initiative. The government is committing only 30% of that initiative to affordable housing. Why is that? Why isn't 100% of that federal lands initiative being dedicated to community housing for the people? It is, after all, public land that belongs to the people.</p>
