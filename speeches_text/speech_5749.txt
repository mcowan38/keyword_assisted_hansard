<p data-HoCid="8769982" data-originallang="fr">Madam Speaker, I appreciate the Bloc Québécois member's question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8769983" data-originallang="fr">We are well aware of what was suggested in the Bloc Québécois's bill. On this side of the House, we are in favour of any effort to combat hatred, particularly the anti-Semitism that we are seeing in Quebec and across Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8769984" data-originallang="fr">We could work together to improve or amend our own bill on online harm, Bill <a data-HoCid="12913297" href="/bills/44-1/C-63/" title="An Act to enact the Online Harms Act, to amend the Criminal Code, the Canadian Human Rights Act and An Act respecting the mandatory reporting of Internet child pornography by persons who provide an Internet service and to make consequential and related amendments to other Acts">C‑63</a>, which is already before the House. We are perfectly willing to work with the Bloc Québécois in that regard.</p>
