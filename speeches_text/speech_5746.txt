<p data-HoCid="8804158" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8804159" data-originallang="en">We're resuming debate on this motion, and the motion, of course, is to talk about the situation or the anticipated situation with the United States, with the Trump administration being elected for the second time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8804160" data-originallang="en">Last time in my comments at the committee, I was talking about the implications of what we experienced in the first Trump administration. You will recall that Canadians were deeply concerned and dismayed about Trump's appalling immigration ban in his first administration. I share those concerns, and I strongly believe that a travel ban against individuals based upon race, religion or country of birth implemented by our closest neighbour cannot be tolerated by Canada. This deeply misguided policy not only sent a chill of intolerance around the world, but I think it emboldened racist sentiments and contributed to unleashing overt acts of racism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8804161" data-originallang="en">In fact, I witnessed some of those and experienced some of those. In my 30-plus years in elected office, I've always experienced racism. I've had horrible messages, hateful messages, sent to me, and a lot of the time they were sent anonymously. However, after the Trump administration was elected, I was attending a rally in my riding to celebrate, actually, the international day for the elimination of racism. A large group of us—families, children, elderly people—were marching up to Victory Square. I was getting ready to speak at the event and to hear the speakers. There were people who had experienced racism, particularly the elderly, the Japanese Canadian community, who had experienced horrific Canadian policies which separated them from their family members and actually caused them to lose their property. In Vancouver, they were housed at the PNE, where the stables are, where the cattle and horses were kept. In any event, we were all there to celebrate the international day for the elimination of racism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8804162" data-originallang="en">As we gathered, there were these white supremacists who appeared around us. You could see them—the Proud Boys, amongst others—all circle around us. Things were getting intense. I was about to be invited up to speak, and the organizer of the event got so worried that he came to me and asked whether or not we should end the event then. I said that we should not because that was exactly their goal: to silence us and stop us from speaking up and speaking out for equality and against discrimination, hate and race supremacy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8804163" data-originallang="en">I got up on the stage, and what did they do? They threw a smoke bomb into the crowd. There was a giant purple haze in the area. That's what happened. To disrupt the event was their intention. It was to get me off the stage, I suppose, to send me a message perhaps. I don't know. Even in spite of that, we persisted. The police were there. I wasn't going to be shut down by people who were full of hate and who wanted to spread their racism and discrimination and who wanted to attempt to intimidate, threaten and silence us.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8804164" data-originallang="en">I carried on, and we finished our event. In the meantime, the organizers had to phone for backup, if you will, because we were quite worried about the people who were there. The children at that point were crying. Seniors were crying. People were clearly shaken up.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8804165" data-originallang="en"> We had to call for backup to make sure that they were assisted, as they made their way back to their car, to the bus station or to the SkyTrain station to go home. That was what happened after the Trump administration's travel ban and hateful immigration policies were announced. I experienced first-hand that emboldening of racism by white supremacists in the community.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8804166" data-originallang="en"> I've always been proud of the fact that Canada has always been a shelter for those who need it. During that unprecedented time, Canada stood strong on that. I still recall the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> sending a clear message.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8804167" data-originallang="en"> Now, I don't agree with the Liberals a lot of the time, but at that moment, he sent a clear message to say, “Canada welcomes you.” I take that to mean we are a country that will not discriminate, a country that will welcome everyone and a country that recognizes the contributions of the multicultural community, the ethnic community, migrants, immigrants, international students and newcomers. We say the colour of your skin doesn't matter; we all belong.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8804168" data-originallang="en">Despite Canada's very checkered history and some very dark history of racism and discriminatory laws, like the one that, for example, imposed a head tax on the Chinese community after the railway was built, when lives were lost and cheap labour was had. When the project was done, Canada tried to do everything to get rid of us, including putting a head tax in place.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8804169" data-originallang="en">There's been some very dark history in Canada, but in spite of all of that, at that moment, I thought it was an important message to send. It was critically important that we establish a clear path for Canada to step in and do our part.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8804170" data-originallang="en"> I believe that all committee members are well aware of that situation. We all experienced it. We all saw it. People were risking life and limb to come to Canada. Why? It's simply that they did not feel that the U.S. was a safe country for them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8804171" data-originallang="en"> When you have a president—at that time, it was Trump—basically telling you that certain races are going to be banned from coming to Canada and they don't want you there, you get a clear message. If that hatred washed over to Canada, where I experienced first-hand the discriminatory sentiments that were hurled at me, you can imagine what it was like for people in the United States at that time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8804172" data-originallang="en">On January 11, 2017, Canadians saw stories about Seidu Mohammed, who at the time was a 24-year-old refugee who nearly died making the dangerous journey from the United States to Canada, crossing into Manitoba on Christmas Eve. You can imagine it. Right now, it's not quite Christmas. It's early December. Here in Ottawa, I must say that this year, the cold weather has come late. I believe yesterday was the first snow day here in Ottawa, which makes me worry about climate change. That said, you can feel the chill in the air in Manitoba.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8804173" data-originallang="en">I went to Manitoba with my colleague <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Leah Gazan</a>. We held a press conference at that very border where Seidu Mohammed crossed over. Oh my God, it was cold that day. The wind was howling. We were standing out there. I was so cold that my face felt frozen and I felt like I couldn't speak. Why were we gathered there? We were gathered there to talk about the safe third country agreement and the implications of what the Canadian government was doing at that time with the changes to it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8804174" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, you're doing some hand signalling. I'm not quite sure what's happening.</p>
