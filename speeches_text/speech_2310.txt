<p data-HoCid="7732055" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, in April, members of Parliament observed commemorations of the Holocaust, the Armenian genocide and the genocide in Rwanda.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7732056" data-originallang="en"> Remembering is vital, but education is equally important, if not more so. Racism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and other forms of hate are proliferating today at an alarming rate, especially online. We need our children to know about the history of genocide and where hate can lead.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7732057" data-originallang="fr">I want to congratulate the Foundation for Genocide Education and its founder, Heidi Berger, for working with the Government of Quebec over the past eight years to create an online teaching guide featuring case studies of nine 20th century genocides. The French version of the guide has been available to high school history teachers across Canada since 2022, while the English version has been available since April 27.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7732058" data-originallang="en">I again call on our provinces and territories to introduce mandatory genocide education, using the guide “Studying Genocide” as the main resource, so that Canada’s youth will learn the consequences of hate and intolerance.</p>
