<p data-HoCid="8703279" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703280" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Bueckert, your organization argues that Palestine meets at least three of the four criteria of the Montevideo Convention to be recognized as a state under international law. The last criterion is having a territory. You say that the territory of Palestine is not defined because Israel illegally occupies Palestinian lands.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703281" data-originallang="fr">Why is it advisable to opt for recognition even if your organization finds that the solution of recognition would not address the substantial means by which Israel occupies Palestinian lands and disregards the human rights of Palestinians?</p>
