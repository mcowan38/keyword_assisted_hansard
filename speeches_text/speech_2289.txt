<p data-HoCid="7716685" data-originallang="en">We're now entering an era where the survivors are almost entirely gone. There are some left, but not that many. While they were alive, the survivors were a tremendous educational force. In the absence of the survivors, what we have are the archives. The archives loom in importance with the passing of the survivors—and, of course, the perpetrators, too—for telling us what happened and educating people. It's not just telling people what we know happened. It's finding out more about what happened. The history isn't complete until we have the records, so people can digest and analyze them.</p>
