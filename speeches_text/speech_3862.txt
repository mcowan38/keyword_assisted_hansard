<p data-HoCid="8301039" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair. We've had this motion before us for quite some time, and I think it should be a concern for all Canadians and all parliamentarians. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8301040" data-originallang="en">I'll speak briefly on, as Mr. Housefather was mentioning, the lawlessness around some of these protests and the fear that that's instilling in many Canadians. I can't imagine the fear that it would instill in Canada's Jewish community. Every Canadian, every person, should feel safe in Canada, and there's no place in Canada or anywhere in the world for anti-Semitism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301041" data-originallang="en">I think this motion is timely and important. I certainly support Mr. Housefather's motion. </p>
