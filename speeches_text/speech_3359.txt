<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">We also mourn the tens of thousands of civilians, including thousands of innocent children, who have been killed by Israel in Gaza. The majority of Gaza's traumatized surviving population has been displaced and needs humanitarian intervention.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Three days ago, the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to take immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Out of respect for the rule of law, Canada should help Israel to comply with that order.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Canada and its allies should reinstate UNRWA funding, considering the devastating humanitarian cases in Palestine.</p>
