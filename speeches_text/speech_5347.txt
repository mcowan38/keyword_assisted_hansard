<p data-HoCid="8692065" data-originallang="en">I am going to speak for one second, but my name has come up multiple times.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8692066" data-originallang="en">First, we've heard about deflection. What we're actually deflecting is the fact that Monday is the last day to extend the ability for this committee to study a bill that is a Conservative bill whose sponsor has refused to appear so far. He has been invited to appear, and he hasn't come. Without extending that, the committee will not be able to properly study the bill.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8692067" data-originallang="en">Then the Conservatives are continuing to talk and not allow us to move to the anti-Semitism study. It's not the Liberals, NDP or Bloc who are talking. It's Conservatives who are refusing to vote to extend their own private member's bill for 30 days for the committee to study. It makes no sense.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8692068" data-originallang="en">The anti-Semitism study was my motion. We strongly support it. We all want to get to the anti-Semitism study.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8692069" data-originallang="en"> I just want to note, in response to my friend, Mr. Brock, that I am not an Israeli. I am a Jewish Canadian. There is a very big difference between being a Jewish Canadian and being an Israeli. I strongly support the State of Israel, but I'm not an Israeli. I just want everybody to use the right lexicon.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8692070" data-originallang="en">However, I appreciate my friends on the Conservative side. We've worked really well together so far on this anti-Semitism study. Let's go to the study. I think we all want to do that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8692071" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
