<p data-HoCid="8454375" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, I just want to make sure that the committee would be able to get the information that was requested of the <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">minister </a>. He was not able to provide the data for the committee members. I want to be clear that this is not missed. I asked the minister for the numbers of TRV applications that are in the system for those in Egypt—this is related to Gaza—and to indicate if they are part of the SIM, the special immigration measure, and whether or not they issue a code, and of those, how many TRVs have been issued to them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8454376" data-originallang="en"> The <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">minister</a> said that he actually didn't know. I said that I was going to bring that to officials, so I want to make sure that the officials will provide that data to us as well.</p>
