<p data-HoCid="8181821" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I appreciate the question and follow-up from the hon. member. She is right that what occurred was absolutely horrific.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8181822" data-originallang="en">I will reiterate what the government has stated, that we are all appalled by the alarming reports of brutal and targeted sexual and gender-based violence perpetrated by Hamas on October 7, 2023, and against hostages they took on that day. We call for a rigorous investigation that prioritizes the rights, needs and safety of those affected.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8181823" data-originallang="en">Using sexual violence as a tactic of war is a crime. We support Israel's right to defend itself in accordance with international law. Hamas is listed as a terrorist organization in Canada, and the Government of Canada has a no-contact policy with this entity.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8181824" data-originallang="en">The <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> has publicly stated that we believe Israeli women. Sexual and gender-based violence increases and is exacerbated by conflict and crisis settings. Too often, issues faced by women, such as those faced by all women across this conflict today, are secondary considerations in conflict situations. That is why, for over 25 years, Canada has historically led on the biennial resolution on the elimination of violence against women and girls at the Human Rights Council. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8181825" data-originallang="en">Canada has also supported the UN Security Council resolutions on conflict-related sexual violence since 2000.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8181826" data-originallang="en">Canada has a feminist foreign policy and a feminist international assistance policy that also prioritize the protection and needs of women in conflict situations. This means, for example, that Canada continues to implement the women, peace and security agenda, which helps ensure that women and girls are fully part of our response.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8181827" data-originallang="en">UN Women is a long-standing partner of Canada when it comes to advancing gender equality globally. We value the excellent work of the agency, in many challenging contexts, to promote the empowerment of women and girls, as well as its global leadership on emerging issues impacting the health and rights of women and girls around the world. UN Women, which the original question was about, publicly stated, “We unequivocally condemn the brutal attacks by Hamas on Israel on 7 October. We are alarmed by the numerous accounts of gender-based atrocities and sexual violence during those attacks.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8181828" data-originallang="en">We expect UN Women, the UN system and member states to draw swift attention to conflict-related sexual violence and ensure that humanitarian response efforts adequately address the needs and rights of crisis-affected women and girls, in all contexts.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8181829" data-originallang="en">In addition, the UN special representative, Pramila Patten, has expressed grave concern about reports of sexual violence against hostages in Hamas captivity and accepted an Israeli invitation to make an official visit to Israel to learn first-hand about the experiences of victims and survivors. Canada welcomed that statement and the visit. We support her engagement on this matter.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8181830" data-originallang="en">As leaders in upholding and advancing the women, peace and security agenda, Canada calls upon its partners to go a step further. We must not only put the security of women and girls first and foremost, but we must also ensure that women's voices are a part of finding a solution.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8181831" data-originallang="en">In conclusion, every woman and girl has the right to live free from violence, regardless of their religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, race, and social and economic status. Let us stand together to protect all women and girls in this terrible conflict and prioritize women's leadership in all aspects of a future peace process.</p>
