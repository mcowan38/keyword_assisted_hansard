<p data-HoCid="8454156" data-originallang="en"> This current special measure right now is for temporary residents. I heard previously that for other people, when it's permanent, it's permanent. They can stay. If it's temporary, I think someone in the room asked—it might have been my colleague Ms. Zahid—what the plan is for the people who come here through the TRV. If Canada's not playing a role in, or maybe doesn't have a future in playing a role in, bringing Gazans back to Gaza when they want to go back, what is the plan after? Is there a plan to extend as we have done for other measures—for Ukraine, for example?</p>
