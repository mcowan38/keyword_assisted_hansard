<p data-HoCid="7957620" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Chair, quite obviously, my colleague is absolutely right.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957621" data-originallang="fr">There has been a lot of talk about an attack on Israel. Now, it is true that some people are trying to downplay the reality of what happened and the disgusting way Hamas attacked Israeli citizens. Canadians died. Some victims were from the United States. There were people at a concert. Young people were there to have fun and listen to music. Paratroopers came in from all sides and started shooting. It does not make any sense at all.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957622" data-originallang="fr">That is why we always have to think of the act that was committed, whether it was against Israel or against people from any other country who were there that day and were attacked by 1,500 Hamas commandos. These terrorists did this simply to spread terror. That is what terrorism is. It is about spreading terror and scaring people.</p>
