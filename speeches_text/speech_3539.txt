<p data-HoCid="8202378" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the violence must stop. We share an immense grief for the tragic loss of civilian life. The horrific attacks by Hamas against Israeli civilians still shock us all. Canada unequivocally condemns its terrorist actions. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8202379" data-originallang="en">What has been happening in Gaza is absolutely dire. The images we are now seeing from Rafah are deeply concerning, and a military operation in Rafah is devastating for Palestinian civilians, as well as foreign nationals, who are seeking refuge. They have nowhere else to go and, as the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="MÃ©lanie Joly">minister</a> has said, asking them to move again is unacceptable. We have also said that the price of defeating Hamas cannot be the continued suffering of all Palestinian civilians. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8202380" data-originallang="en">We continue to support the urgent efforts for a sustainable ceasefire. This cannot be one-sided. Hamas must release all hostages and lay down its arms, and humanitarian access must urgently be increased and sustained. I also want to reassure all Canadians that we are in regular and close contact with our allies and partners in the region, including Israel, Egypt and Qatar. In fact, today Canada welcomes His Majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan. During the visit, peace and security in the Middle East will be an important topic of discussion, including the urgent delivery of rapid, unimpeded humanitarian relief for civilians in Gaza, support for a sustainable ceasefire and the path toward lasting peace in the region.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8202381" data-originallang="en">Canada continues to believe in a two-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side in peace and security. When it comes to the ICJ, Canada was a founding voice, and it remains a strong proponent of the court's independence. We support its critical role in the peaceful settlement of disputes and its work in upholding the international rules-based order. Orders of the ICJ are binding on all parties, and they must comply with them. It is for the ICJ to make the final decision on the case, and we continue to follow the case very closely.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8202382" data-originallang="en">As for export permits to Israel, it is important to understand what we are talking about here. There is a wide range of items that require an export permit. These include items such as telecom equipment, decontamination equipment, protective equipment and imaging equipment, military parts and components. There is also a wide range of end-users, including academic institutions and small businesses. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8202383" data-originallang="en">When we look at permits for export to Israel in particular, in recent years, our government has not received and, therefore, has not approved any export permits for weapons: no permits for bombs, rockets, missiles or explosive devices. The permits issued since October 7 and, in fact, all permits that are currently open are for non-lethal equipment. I will reiterate that there are no current permits to export weapons or ammunition.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8202384" data-originallang="en">Canada has a very robust export control system. We are a state party to the UN Arms Trade Treaty and take that responsibility very seriously. The government has been consistent and diligent in the way decisions have been made on export permits, and we will continue to be. That policy has not changed.</p>
