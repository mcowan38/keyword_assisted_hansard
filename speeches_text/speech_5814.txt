<p data-HoCid="8817533" data-originallang="en">I'd be interested in hearing from both of you on where the puck is going with respect to the Kurdish involvement in Syria, and particularly if you think there's going to be a drawdown of American resources there. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8817534" data-originallang="en">Second, what might Erdogan be expected to do, particularly with the administration in Syria?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8817535" data-originallang="en"> Third, you've spoken about the Russians extensively, so I think you've answered that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8817536" data-originallang="en">Fourth, I think the big unknown here is Israel and what it could be anticipated to do. </p>
