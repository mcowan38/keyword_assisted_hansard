<p data-HoCid="8604945" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8604946" data-originallang="en">I'd like to welcome to the committee all of the witnesses today. It is great to be back on pre-budget submissions, listening to the various stakeholders from across our country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8604947" data-originallang="en">I would like to start with B'nai Brith. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8604948" data-originallang="en">Thank you for being here, gentlemen. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8604949" data-originallang="en">About two months ago, I visited the Toronto Holocaust Museum. I went down there and took a tour. Many years ago, I had the opportunity to visit Yad Vashem. One of the things that struck me is the level of disinformation and misinformation—folks not believing that the events of the Holocaust actually happened. It's especially younger folks, if I can say that. It's what the data brings out. It is scary. What is also scary is the level of anti-Semitism we are seeing here in Canada. Jewish Canadians do not deserve that in any manner. I come from the city of Vaughan. We have a very vibrant Jewish community, among many others. I think over 120 languages are spoken in the city I live in—one of the ridings I get to represent.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8604950" data-originallang="en">My first question to B'nai Brith is with regard to the anti-racism strategy and countering the disinformation and anti-Semitism we're seeing. What are the most effective tools the government can provide? </p>
