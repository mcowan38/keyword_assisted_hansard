<p data-HoCid="8576798" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I believe that, if we look at it, Hezbollah and Hamas are terrorist organizations funded, backed and armed by the terrorist regime in Tehran. We hear all the time here that we want to have a ceasefire, but I never hear from the Liberals or the NDP about the government in Lebanon. Why can it not stop Hezbollah? Why does the Palestinian authority not stop Hamas? They have not been able to, so that does not leave any other option to the Government of Israel but to go and defend themselves and protect themselves, which means that they actually have to go and hunt out the terrorists who are attacking their country and their citizens.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576799" data-originallang="en">My question to my colleague is this. This government continues to take Canadian taxpayer dollars to fund UNRWA, which has been sheltering terrorist operators in Hamas in both Gaza and in Lebanon. Should the government continue to fund UNRWA, or should we actually stop taxpayer money from being used to support terrorist operations against Israel?</p>
