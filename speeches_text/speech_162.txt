<p data-HoCid="6153332" data-originallang="en">When we discuss things in the north, a lot of things aren't very simply put, so to speak. What are some of the suggestions you would have around mental health services, something very much lacking throughout the northern Inuit Nunangat? Would you have some suggestions for committee members at the federal level for increasing those mental health services? What starting point would you suggest?</p>
