<p data-HoCid="8692088" data-originallang="en">My intervention will be very brief. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8692089" data-originallang="en">The only people who are preventing us from concluding the anti-Semitism study right now are the Conservatives. Let's just get that very clear. We could be done right now if we just simply brought this matter to a vote. We are dealing with a timeline issue. We need to study <a data-HoCid="278476" href="/politicians/arnold-viersen/" title="Arnold Viersen">Mr. Viersen</a>'s bill at this committee. It's been delayed for one reason or another, but that's beside the point. We need the extra time to call witnesses. It doesn't have to be Mr. Viersen; it can be other witnesses, but we also need the time for clause-by-clause review of the bill before we report it back to the House. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8692090" data-originallang="en">There's a very easy solution, Madam Chair. If the Conservatives stop speaking and allow us to vote on this very simple and reasonable extension, we can do two things I've heard them arguing for. We can get back to the anti-Semitism study, and we can study <a data-HoCid="278476" href="/politicians/arnold-viersen/" title="Arnold Viersen">Mr. Viersen</a>'s bill. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8692091" data-originallang="en">The power is in their hands, Madam Chair. I'll let the public judge as to whether they're going to do that or not. </p>
