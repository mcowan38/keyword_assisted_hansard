<p data-HoCid="8362219" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I also condemn the extremism of a prime minister who gives hundreds of thousands of dollars of anti-racism money to a Jew-hater who has proposed shooting Jews in the head. I condemn a prime minister who allows the IRGC, which murdered 55 Canadians, to remain legal. I condemn a prime minister who allows the open use of crack, heroin, meth and weapons in hospital rooms, which threatens nurses, and on school buses next to children. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8362220" data-originallang="en">Will the Prime Minister reverse his extremist policies and the death they bring?</p>
