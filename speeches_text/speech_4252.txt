<p data-HoCid="8435021" data-originallang="en">Think about it. For many Jews, going to synagogue is like going through the airport. There's security at the door. Imagine your church or your temple having to go through that level of security. It is very expensive for members of the Jewish community, when they belong to a synagogue, to have to pay for this. Therefore, we're grateful that this program was put in place by the Conservative government. We are grateful that it has been bona fide under this current government. We are grateful that it seems to have support from every political party, but it can be better.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435022" data-originallang="en">One of the things that I would suggest this committee look at is the Community Security Trust. That's the British model that creates a synergy between the Jewish community and law enforcement to make sure the security is dynamic and it's not simply helping institutions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435023" data-originallang="en">I'll close with this: We need training for prosecutors and not just police officers, because prosecutors—and Mr. Mendicino knows about this—have an important role and a crucial role to play in our justice system.</p>
