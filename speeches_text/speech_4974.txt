<p data-HoCid="8594869" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, one year ago today, Hamas committed the greatest massacre of the Jewish people since the Holocaust. The attack should have woken all of us up to the fact that the terror regime in Tehran and its proxy groups seek the destruction not only of the Jewish people but of democratic values around the world. These groups care nothing for the lives of the people subjugated under their rule, and they subject them only to death and misery. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8594870" data-originallang="en">The genocidal regime in Iran and its proxy terror groups are the foe today, which failing hands threw us the torch to guard against. In that, we must know that the promise of Canada does not self-perpetuate. We must fight for it every day. That means rejecting feckless leaders who placate lawless mobs within Canada's streets. It also means defending the right of Israel, a democratic nation, to protect itself from the same terror groups that also seek death to our Canadian way of life. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8594871" data-originallang="en">I remind my colleagues that peace never comes through appeasement. It only comes through strength. <em>Am Yisrael Chai.</em></p>
