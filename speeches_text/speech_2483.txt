<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en"> <em>Uqaqtittiji</em>, I am very pleased to appear this evening from my home riding in Nunavut. I am pleased to submit that the NDP supports passing Bill <a data-HoCid="12138647" href="/bills/44-1/C-35/" title="An Act respecting early learning and child care in Canada">C-35</a>. The NDP has, for a long time, fought for a national child care program that is enshrined in legislation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Before I get to the main aspects of my speech, I highlight and thank the MP for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> for her great work, the MP for <a data-HoCid="278292" href="/politicians/lindsay-mathyssen/" title="Lindsay Mathyssen">London—Fanshawe</a> for the work she did on Bill <a data-HoCid="11415498" href="/bills/43-2/C-311/" title="An Act respecting early learning and child care">C-311</a> in the 43rd Parliament and Olivia Chow for her work, in the 40th Parliament, on Bill <a data-HoCid="3626868" href="/bills/40-2/C-373/" title="An Act to establish criteria and conditions in respect of funding for early learning and child care programs in order to ensure the quality, accessibility, universality and accountability of those programs, and to appoint a council to advise the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development on matters relating to early learning and child care">C-373</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">New Democrats truly believe that every parent across Canada deserves access to affordable, high-quality child care wherever they live in Canada. That is why passing Bill <a data-HoCid="12138647" href="/bills/44-1/C-35/" title="An Act respecting early learning and child care in Canada">C-35</a> is so important.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">My intervention tonight will focus on three areas at this stage of the bill. First, I will speak to some of the content of the bill. Second, I will highlight the inclusion of international instruments in Bill <a data-HoCid="12138647" href="/bills/44-1/C-35/" title="An Act respecting early learning and child care in Canada">C-35</a> and the importance of acknowledging indigenous laws in implementing these important instruments. Finally, I will address some of the disinformation that has been shared by other members in the House.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">The content of Bill <a data-HoCid="12138647" href="/bills/44-1/C-35/" title="An Act respecting early learning and child care in Canada">C-35</a> is important because it would set out a vision for the creation of a national early learning and child care system. It would ensure that there are principles that guide federal investments. These are important as they will show the willingness of this Parliament to invest in children, as they truly are the future and we must do what we can to keep it secured.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Bill <a data-HoCid="12138647" href="/bills/44-1/C-35/" title="An Act respecting early learning and child care in Canada">C-35</a> would establish a national advisory council on early learning and child care. This is such an important measure to ensure that policy-making and advocacy would come from experts in the field. It is truly my hope that the composition of this council would include indigenous peoples in Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">It is great to hear at this stage that Bill <a data-HoCid="12138647" href="/bills/44-1/C-35/" title="An Act respecting early learning and child care in Canada">C-35</a> has been improved in some areas through the work of the HUMA committee One such area is the strengthening of reporting requirements, specifically in areas where the minister responsible must report to Parliament. Another is to recognize that working conditions affect the provision of child care programs, and, as such, improvements were made regarding working conditions in this area.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">International instruments and indigenous laws are also important. I turn now to the incredibly great work that my NDP colleague, the MP for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>, was able to do in ensuring that indigenous rights are protected and that international instruments are included in Bill <a data-HoCid="12138647" href="/bills/44-1/C-35/" title="An Act respecting early learning and child care in Canada">C-35</a>. Specifically, I outline the important inclusion of recognizing the rights established in both the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. These are meant to have Canada acknowledge Canada's international obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Finally, I highlight the prominent place for indigenous peoples to have free, prior and informed consent on matters pertaining to children. With June being National Indigenous History Month, I take every opportunity I can to make interventions that include indigenous history. What implementing the international instruments could look like is recognizing the existence of indigenous laws surrounding the raising of children. For example, in Inuit laws, there are three areas of laws that govern Inuit. I thank Jarich Oosten, Frédéric Laugrand and Willem Rasing for editing the book entitled <em>Inuit Laws</em>. The content of this book is based on interviews with Inuit elders: Mariano Aupilaarjuk, Marie Tulimaaq, Akisu Joamie, Émile Imaruittuq and Lucassie Nutaraaluk. I honour their great knowledge and their sharing it for us to use. What a privilege it is to share these names in the House.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">The laws described in this book are <em>piqujait</em>, <em>maligait</em> and <em>tirigusuusiit</em>. I describe the first two for this speech. As I stated earlier this month, these categories govern our behaviours and our relationships to each other and to wildlife and the environment.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en"> <em>Piqujait</em>, translated into English, means “behaviours that must be done as directed by a person of authority”. An example is <em>piqujait</em> from parents to children. In today's society, <em>piqujait</em> can also be used by child care workers when they are taking care of children in day care settings.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en"> <em>Maligait</em> is translated into English as “those that must be followed”. These differ from <em>piqujait</em> because they focus on the obligation to obey. A <em>maligait</em> in this system could be used to establish policies, regulations and instruments that could guide decision-making.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">I look forward to learning, in my role as indigenous critic, more about indigenous laws held by first nations and Métis so that I may speak to them. Even better, it would be great to see more first nations, Métis and Inuit across Canada taking up the challenge of representing their peoples in the House. I encourage more indigenous people to consider running in the next federal election so we can continue to make laws that reflect our existence.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Finally, in addressing the disinformation that has been shared by other members in the House, I will talk about what has been shared mainly by Conservative members. I hope to remind Canadians of some of these issues. As I have outlined in my speech, Bill <a data-HoCid="12138647" href="/bills/44-1/C-35/" title="An Act respecting early learning and child care in Canada">C-35</a> is not just about existing agreements; it is about much more than that. Conservatives have shared that Bill C-35 would not provide supports to parents to get access to child care. The Conservatives, at HUMA, introduced amendments to remove prioritization of non-profit and public child care. They argued that prioritizing these groups makes it unfair to for-profit child care businesses. This is entirely untrue. Prioritization is not elimination; prioritization is giving equity-seeking groups extra supports they have been excluded from for years. Including prioritization of non-profit and public child care would ensure that children get a more full spectrum of child care in Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">In support of these arguments, I highlight two testimonies that were shared at HUMA in studying Bill <a data-HoCid="12138647" href="/bills/44-1/C-35/" title="An Act respecting early learning and child care in Canada">C-35</a>. The first is from Pierre Fortin, an emeritus professor of economics, who said, “There is no way to escape the conclusion that private markets for child care have, unfortunately, been a quality failure. I'm saying ‘unfortunately’ because I have defended private market solutions throughout my career, but a fact is a fact.” Second, I quote Morna Ballantyne, executive director of Child Care Now, who said, “Federal public funds should be directed to expanding the provision of high-quality early learning and child care, not to expanding opportunities to make private profit or to increasing the equity of privately held real estate and other business assets.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">In conclusion, I am very excited to support Bill <a data-HoCid="12138647" href="/bills/44-1/C-35/" title="An Act respecting early learning and child care in Canada">C-35</a>. It gives me hope that children and parents will be better supported. With the passing of Bill C-35, decision-making would be founded on human rights and indigenous rights. Accountability and transparency would be monitored by a national council composed of experts from the field. This bill would indeed help ensure working conditions for child care workers.</p>
