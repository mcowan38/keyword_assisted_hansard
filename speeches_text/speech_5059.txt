<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">I'll come to you in a minute. I just want to bring forward and put on notice a motion. </p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">The reason I am doing this is that there were some very reckless comments made by the <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">leader of the official opposition </a> on Monday night: </p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en"> “I will vote against anti-Israel resolutions at the United Nations,” he said. “I will back Israel's right to defend itself, which includes retaliating against those that attack Israel. Israel must be able to prevent Iran from using nuclear weapons, if necessary, that means proactively striking Iranian nuclear sites and oil installations to defund the terrorist regime.” </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">For that reason, Mr. Chair, I would like to put on notice a motion. It reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en"> Given the reckless and dangerous comments of the Leader of the Opposition, Pierre Poilievre, calling for potential strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, pursuant to Standing Order 108(2) the committee undertake a study of the law of armed conflict and Canada’s obligations under international law. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">Thank you very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">I'm sorry about that. Thank you very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">I want to say thanks to all of you for coming in front of our committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Ms. Hadwen, the minister did share and make reference to the possibility that you could continue expanding on some of the most recent investments made and the importance of your department, but also in the context of the international risk regarding cybersecurity, cyber-attacks, AI and everything. I know that there has been some great news, and I would really like you to expand on that for us this morning.</p>
