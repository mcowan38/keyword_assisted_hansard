<p data-HoCid="7970489" data-originallang="fr">Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7970490" data-originallang="fr">First of all, I'd like to offer my condolences to all those people in Israel and the territories for the loss of loved ones. This is something that touches my fellow citizens. We feel very sorry for everyone who is suffering at this time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7970491" data-originallang="fr">That being said, as you know very well, Mr. Chair, I've already defended our committee and made it clear that our job or mandate is to study the Auditor General's reports and work with departments, deputy ministers and others to examine the work done by the government.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7970492" data-originallang="fr">I recognize the serious nature of the motion before us. However, I fail to see how our committee could discuss such a motion.</p>
