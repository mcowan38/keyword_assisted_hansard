<p data-HoCid="8667507" data-originallang="en"> I appreciate that response.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8667508" data-originallang="en">I have a question that I'd like to put to each member of the panel, and it has to deal with the responsibility that verified users on your platforms have when it comes to the dissemination of disinformation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8667509" data-originallang="en">Mr. Fernández, you talked about the grey check mark and the trust that users of your service can have when they recognize that the grey check mark means that this person is an elected official or a government official.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8667510" data-originallang="en">I want to read to you a post on X from October 17, 2023. Canada's <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">foreign affairs minister</a> posts, “Bombing a hospital is an unthinkable act, and there is no doubt that doing so is absolutely illegal.” That post was viewed 2.7 million times. It's still live on your site today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8667511" data-originallang="en">I want to juxtapose that with an ABC News story from October 18, 2023. I'm just going to read you the first paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8667512" data-originallang="en"> A day after the Hamas-led Gaza Health Ministry claimed Israel had attacked the Al Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, saying some 500 Palestinians had been killed, Israeli and U.S. officials, explosives experts, and President Joe Biden said Wednesday that available evidence shows the destruction was caused instead by a failed Palestinian terrorist rocket launch. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8667513" data-originallang="en">How difficult is it for your users—and also your services—to manage this when we have this type of recklessness not only from an elected official but also from the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">foreign affairs minister</a> of a G7 country who is spreading what is demonstrably evidenced as fake news, false information—call it what you will?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8667514" data-originallang="en">We talk about misinformation. The chair has pointed out before that that's a clever term for when people lie. What kinds of challenges does it create when this type of actor is posting this type of misinformation?</p>
