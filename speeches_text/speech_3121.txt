<p data-HoCid="8048967" data-originallang="en">I am proud to be co-hosting a reception today with the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, or UNICEF, to bring more attention to children's rights, particularly those impacted by war, poverty and disease.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8048968" data-originallang="en">Last week, I hosted 23 highschool students from Milton in my office to voice their concerns. They do not have a vote yet but they do have a voice. It is critical that we elected people listen to youth and take action on their priorities. Every single adult has a moral and ethical obligation to protect every single child.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8048969" data-originallang="en">On this World Children's Day and over the past 44 days, the world has been confronted by the images of murdered and injured Palestinian children in Gaza, and the knowledge that Israeli children were murdered and taken hostage by Hamas. By absolutely no fault of their own, these kids are caught in the crossfire of this decades-long conflict, victims of their surroundings and circumstances.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8048970" data-originallang="en">Children are innocent. They should never be targets of violence or warfare. I continue to call for the immediate release of all hostages and the protection of civilians, especially children and young people.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8048971" data-originallang="en"> I continue to amplify the UN resolution for a ceasefire and an end to the violence.</p>
