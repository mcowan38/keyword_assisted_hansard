<p data-HoCid="8783139" data-originallang="fr">I would like you not just to be comfortable listening to me, but also to be comfortable agreeing with us. I understand that I will not get that consent today, but I invite you to think about it seriously.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8783140" data-originallang="fr">What we are doing is looking at the question from all angles. As you know, the committee has held meetings in recent weeks in connection with its study of Islamophobia and antisemitism. You have heard about our debates. After listening to all the testimony, I find this question to be increasingly timely and increasingly urgent. Ms. Lyons, the special envoy on preserving Holocaust remembrance and combatting antisemitism, also testified before the committee. While she did not say she was in agreement on this question, she found it interesting and said we should look into it. I would therefore press the point and say to you that this is something of considerable importance in the fight against hate speech.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8783141" data-originallang="fr">I am changing the subject quickly because I have barely a minute left. This morning, La Presse published an article critical of the problems surrounding the appointment of Quebec judges to the Federal Court of Canada. I am sure you saw it, or at least were briefed on it. I imagine there will be two new judges from Quebec appointed to the Federal Court of Canada over the next few days. Can we expect you to appoint Quebec judges? As you know, the Federal Courts Act requires that there be 5 Quebec judges on the Federal Court of Appeal and 10 Quebec judges on the Federal Court.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8783142" data-originallang="fr">At the moment there is a deficit, as Quebec's Minister of Justice pointed out. Can we expect that you will remedy this appointments deficit by naming Quebec judges to those vacant positions over the next few days?</p>
