<p data-HoCid="7469019" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, today is Jewish refugee day. On this day, we commemorate the nearly one million Jewish refugees who were forcibly displaced from Arab countries and Iran between the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7469020" data-originallang="en">For centuries, large Jewish communities lived in the Middle East, Iran and north Africa in relative peace with their neighbours. However, everything changed in the years leading up to and following the rebirth of the state of Israel in 1948. Suddenly, Jews were subjected to systemic anti-Semitism and evicted from their homes. They were subjected to arbitrary arrest, torture and murder.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7469021" data-originallang="en">This year, B'nai Brith, which is Canada's oldest Jewish advocacy organization, will again commemorate these refugees and will raise awareness of this great injustice by hosting a virtual event tonight. I urge MPs from all parties to join this event. It can be accessed on the website.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7469022" data-originallang="en">Let us all remember the stories of Jewish refugees from Arab lands and Iran, and continue to fight against anti-Semitism, injustice and racism in all of its forms.</p>
