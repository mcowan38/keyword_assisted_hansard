<p data-HoCid="8762921" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and I'd like to thank the witnesses for being with us today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8762922" data-originallang="en"> I want to follow up on something that my colleague, MP Duncan, mentioned. He mentioned in his line of questioning an advance to the date of October 13. Obviously, we cannot as it is Thanksgiving, and Monday, October 6, is actually Sukkot, a Jewish high holiday. The week prior is September 29, the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, and there are municipal elections in Newfoundland and Labrador. The week prior to that is Rosh Hashanah, and September 1 is Labour Day. I've looked at the length of the campaign. It has to be between 36 days and 50 days. Mathematically, I looked at all of the Mondays in the fall. Unfortunately, there are many Mondays that have conflicts. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8762923" data-originallang="en">Further to that, my question is actually for Ms. Reusch. I had the great pleasure of being on the electoral reform committee back in 2016. Apathy is Boring presented to us at that time. It was on October 3, 2016, in Montreal, and Carolyn Loutfi presented to us. We heard from her that—and you mentioned something along these lines—if youth don't vote in their first two elections upon eligibility, it's very likely they will not continue to vote. At that time, it was suggested that, perhaps, we should look at piloting online voting. You didn't mention that in your remarks. You did mention the weekend voting, which I'll get to. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8762924" data-originallang="en"> It's not something we did recommend at that time for many reasons. We now see a lot more with respect to foreign interference in elections, and the use of cyber-attacks. What are your thoughts on that? You didn't mention it. I just want to know—has there been a change in your position on that? </p>
