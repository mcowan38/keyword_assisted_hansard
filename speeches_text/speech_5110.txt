<p data-HoCid="8663356" data-originallang="en">That's an excellent question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8663357" data-originallang="en">The reference to the Paris ministerial meeting that just wrapped up two or three hours ago is a good hook, because France's desire with that conference was, first of all, to put a spotlight on the situation and, in particular, to rally a number of countries to do more to support the Lebanese Armed Forces.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8663358" data-originallang="en">The fact of the matter is that the southern part of Lebanon is largely occupied by Hezbollah forces. That is obviously the part that Israel is at war with. Israel does not want war with Lebanon. Israel is in a fight with Hezbollah and has gone further and deeper into the country to fight Hezbollah bases and centres of operation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8663359" data-originallang="en">One of the things that we, as the international community, really want to do is reinforce the role, the training and the capacity of the Lebanese Armed Forces so that it can substitute Hezbollah forces in southern Lebanon. If that substitution were to take place and the Lebanese Armed Forces could be entrusted to guarantee security in the southern part of the country, Israel would feel much greater security. That could lead to a political process, better diplomacy and eventually negotiations on border demarcation.</p>
