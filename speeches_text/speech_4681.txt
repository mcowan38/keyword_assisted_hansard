<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8482883" data-originallang="fr"> Allah, take care of these Zionist aggressors. Allah, take care of the enemies of the people of Gaza. Allah, identify them all, then exterminate them. And don't spare any of them. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8482884" data-originallang="fr">That is what Adil Charkaoui said in Montreal on October 28, 2023.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8482885" data-originallang="fr">He did not suffer any consequences because, in Canada, the law allows a person to ask for the extermination of an entire people under the cover of religion. The RCMP is calling for the modernization of the Criminal Code so that it will be better equipped to deal with hate crimes. The Bloc Québécois is proposing that this religious exemption be repealed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8482886" data-originallang="fr">Will the minister support us?</p>
