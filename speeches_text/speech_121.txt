<p data-HoCid="6112256" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6112257" data-originallang="en">As you know, my colleague Mr. Harris served in the House for a long time. Canada's position with respect to Israel has always been to further the goal of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East, which includes the creation of a Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with Israel. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6112258" data-originallang="en">I think we always need to renew these efforts and we always need to think about how we can have a viable two-state solution with two states living side by side in peace and security. We are an ally of Israel, but we are also a friend of the Palestinian people. When it comes to the settlement, as you know, our policy in Canada has been consistent for many years. We do not recognize the permanent Israeli-controlled territories that were occupied in 1967. We are always trying to find ways, and we are looking at promoting dialogue, because that situation can only be solved by involvement of the parties negotiating directly.</p>
