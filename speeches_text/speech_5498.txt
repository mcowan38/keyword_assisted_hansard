<p data-HoCid="8733697" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733698" data-originallang="en"> Good morning. I'm a philosopher and dean of arts at the University of Regina. I'm here today as a scholar of academic freedom and campus freedom of expression. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8733699" data-originallang="en">As a dean, I have the opportunity to observe and defend academic freedom in practice, but my remarks reflect my own scholarship and do not represent the University of Regina or the faculty of arts.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733700" data-originallang="en"> Academic freedom is distinct from freedom of expression, but they are deeply entwined. Academic freedom enables post-secondary scholarly personnel to pursue, without interference or reprisal, universities' academic mission to seek truth and advance understanding in the service of society.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733701" data-originallang="en"> Academic freedom includes two varieties of expressive freedom. These are freedom of intramural expression, which can include criticism of the university, and freedom of extramural expression, scholarly personnel's freedom to engage in speech in the public sphere. These expressive freedoms are unlimited so long as they are lawful.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733702" data-originallang="en"> By contrast, academic freedom occurs within systems of academic quality control exercised by scholarly personnel. For instance, scholarly referees and editors adjudicate publication decisions and collegial bodies determine curricula.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733703" data-originallang="en"> The first modern implementation of academic freedom was in the establishment in 1809 of the University of Berlin, the first modern research university. Its founder, Wilhelm von Humboldt, enshrined solitude and freedom as twin principles of the university. By “freedom”, he meant unconstrained curiosity-based research, teaching and learning by scholarly personnel, including students. By “solitude”, he meant isolation from outside interference, an early exemplar of what is today termed “institutional autonomy”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733704" data-originallang="en"> The need to provide protections against external interference, and in particular political interference, was especially important, since German universities were essentially a branch of government. Thus, from 1848 to 1933, German constitutions enshrined academic freedom protections.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733705" data-originallang="en"> In some states, such as pre-1933 Germany and post-apartheid South Africa, academic freedom receives distinct constitutional protection. In others, it receives indirect constitutional protection via freedom of expression provisions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733706" data-originallang="en"> The two examples of constitutionally protected academic freedom I just gave point to an important fact about academic freedom: It flourishes in democracies. It dies under authoritarian rule.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733707" data-originallang="en"> With Hitler's rise to power in 1933, academic freedom was abolished in Germany. Jewish professors were fired. Remaining professors were forced to teach Nazi race science. By contrast, when the Mandela government sought to rebuild an equitable and democratic South Africa, it enshrined academic freedom in the constitution.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733708" data-originallang="en"> Wherever authoritarianism is on the rise in our own time, we see corresponding attacks on academic freedom and universities' institutional autonomy. In recent years, we have seen government bans on teaching gender studies in Hungary and Poland and on teaching critical race theory in a number of U.S. states.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733709" data-originallang="en"> Provincial governments in Ontario, Quebec and Alberta have threatened universities' Humboldtian solitude by imposing on them free speech policies that, far from protecting expressive freedom, actually undercut institutional autonomy, as well as placing censorious limits on student protest, a time-worn form of campus expression that has long been, among other things, a mode whereby students develop their moral and intellectual autonomy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733710" data-originallang="en"> In the U.S., in December 2023, the United States Congress's hearing on anti-Semitism marked a new chapter in state interference in academic freedom, campus expressive freedom and institutional autonomy. Representatives' interrogation of three college presidents regarding their universities' approach to solidarity statements, institutional neutrality and student protest was deeply chilling, not least because two of the presidents' replies were politically weaponized to force their resignations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733711" data-originallang="en"> The most aggressive interrogator of the U.S. university presidents was Representative Elise Stefanik, recently tapped to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Representative Stefanik claimed that the hearing resignations were just the beginning of the reckoning and that Republicans will carry out a long-overdue cleansing of higher education.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733712" data-originallang="en"> A week after the congressional hearing, five MPs wrote to Canadian university presidents to exert similar pressure on them. This would have been a wildly inappropriate state challenge to institutional autonomy if it had come from provincial governments. It was even more shocking and unprecedented coming from federal members of Parliament, given that education is under provincial and not federal jurisdiction. Some MPs continue to make public statements aimed at chilling expression about Israel and Palestine within educational institutions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733713" data-originallang="en"> Canada's universities make crucial contributions to science, society, industry and the economy. Despite recent challenges, academic freedom is healthier in Canada than anywhere else in the world. It is crucial for Canadian lawmakers to reaffirm academic freedom and universities' institutional autonomy so that Canadian universities can continue to contribute to science, industry and society, while preserving the crucial protections of solitude and freedom for the universities of tomorrow, both in Canada and worldwide.</p>
