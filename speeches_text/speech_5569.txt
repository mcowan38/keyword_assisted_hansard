<p data-HoCid="8712210" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the anti-Semitic violence threatening the lives of Jewish Canadians has now come to Parliament Hill. A homemade bomb had been built by ISIS terrorists, and the RCMP foiled a plot to detonate it during last December's rally for Israel. After nine years under the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, hate crimes have increased by 251%, with 66% being directed towards Jews. Synagogues and Jewish schools are being firebombed. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8712211" data-originallang="en">Canada's Jewish community has implored the government to act against this rising tide of hate. The Conservative members of the public safety committee have asked for an emergency meeting to root out this evil. Every Jew has the right to live in safety and freedom from harm; shamefully, however, Liberal members are blocking the meeting. Frankly, it is disgusting.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8712212" data-originallang="en">Will the Liberal members of the public safety committee do their job and keep Canada's Jews safe before a bomb actually goes off?</p>
