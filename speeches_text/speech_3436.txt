<p data-HoCid="8170744" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, Canada mourns the loss of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives in this conflict. We express our condolences to all families and communities affected by this violence. Canada unequivocally condemns the brutal terrorist attacks perpetrated by Hamas against Israel on October 7. Nothing can justify these acts of terror and the killing, maiming and abduction of civilians. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8170745" data-originallang="en">At the same time, we are horrified by the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and its impact on civilians. All parties to the conflict have an obligation to allow and facilitate the rapid and unimpeded access of humanitarian relief for civilians. Canada calls for a resumption of humanitarian pauses, and it supports urgent international efforts toward a sustainable ceasefire. Throughout, we have based our decisions on the innocent civilians involved in this conflict. As the situation continues, it is vital that life-saving humanitarian relief can reach Palestinian civilians in need. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8170746" data-originallang="en">We have demonstrated Canada's commitment to helping support the agencies that are working hard to help people in Gaza. To date, Canada has announced $100 million in humanitarian assistance to address the urgent needs of vulnerable civilians impacted by this crisis. We were the first western country to announce an increase in our aid to Palestinian civilians. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8170747" data-originallang="en">With regard to UNRWA, Canada is deeply alarmed by the allegations that some staff members were involved in Hamas's brutal terrorist attacks against Israel on October 7. As a result, we announced an immediate pause of any additional funding to UNRWA. These allegations are extremely serious, and we look forward to the investigation into them. In addition, UNRWA has committed to an independent review of the organization.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8170748" data-originallang="en">We will continue to work with the agency and other donors to support the investigation into these serious and deeply concerning allegations, while maintaining our commitment to helping the most vulnerable Palestinian civilians in the region. We recognize that civilians' need for humanitarian assistance is growing by the hour.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8170749" data-originallang="fr">Since the start of the crisis, our position has always been, and continues to be, centred on the firm conviction that Gaza needs more aid, not less. As UNRWA moves forward with this review, Canada will not reduce its support for the people of Gaza.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8170750" data-originallang="en">Yesterday, we announced an additional $40 million in humanitarian assistance to help the most vulnerable Palestinian civilians. This funding will help Canada's partners to provide food, water, emergency medical assistance, protection services and other life-saving assistance. As is the case for all humanitarian and development funding to Palestinians, our additional assistance will be subject to our robust, enhanced due diligence process to ensure that no funding gets into the hands of terrorist groups, such as Hamas.</p>
