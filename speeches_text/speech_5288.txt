<p data-HoCid="8693735" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much for those very important questions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693736" data-originallang="en"> First of all, on the question of borders, the recognition of a Palestinian state should be within the June 4 lines, the lines that existed before the 1967 war. In other words, it's within the Green Line. This doesn't preclude the negotiation of final borders between the State of Palestine and the State of Israel. Ultimately, the final borders of a Palestinian state and of the State of Israel have to be negotiated between the two sides. I think the recognition should be within the June 4, 1967 lines.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693737" data-originallang="en"> On the question of citizens, ultimately it is clearly up to the State of Palestine, as a sovereign state, to decide its citizenship policies. We should be very careful about assuming that somehow citizens of Israel who are Palestinian Arabs would be future citizens of such a state. Most have said, quite clearly, that they wish to remain citizens of the State of Israel and that their citizenship should remain in Israel. Of course, they may well be granted dual citizenship by the State of Palestine if they wish to claim that and if the State of Palestine were to grant it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693738" data-originallang="en">In terms of the government, there is already a quasi-government functioning in the West Bank. This is, of course, the Palestinian Authority, which, as I mentioned, was established under the Oslo accords. I think recognition of Palestinian statehood should be linked to reforms undertaken by the Palestinian Authority, particularly democratic reforms, such as ensuring judicial reform. We have a kind of embryonic Palestinian government already in existence; that government needs to be given greater legitimacy. Affording it statehood would give it legitimacy and enable it to govern not only the West Bank but also, ultimately, the Gaza Strip.</p>
