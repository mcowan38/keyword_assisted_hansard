<p data-HoCid="8576759" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Charleswood—St. James—Assiniboia—Headingley for his strong advocacy for Israel and his ongoing strength in speaking on behalf of the Jewish community in Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576760" data-originallang="en">Truth to power is key to making sure that we get to the bottom of this situation. The member clearly laid out that the ongoing attacks by organizations that we recognize as terrorist organizations, Hezbollah and Hamas, backed by the Iranian regime, is at the heart of the attacks on Israel, and Israel has the right to defend itself. He mentioned the issue of the government's self-imposed ban on any arms that support Israel. It is like asking a boxer to go into the ring and fight with one arm behind his back. We have to make sure that Israel, a democracy, a pluralistic society that respects human rights, has every tool in its ability to defend itself.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576761" data-originallang="en">Does my colleague believe that with all the rhetoric coming from the NDP and the doublespeak coming from the Government of Canada, from both the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> and the Liberal <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">foreign minister</a>, at the heart of this is that they are anti-Zionists and that anti-Zionism is another term for being anti-Semitic?</p>
