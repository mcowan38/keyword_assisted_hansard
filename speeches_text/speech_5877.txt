<p data-HoCid="8829289" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8829290" data-originallang="en">I appreciate that decision. If the Liberal members need to talk to their team, they can go ahead and do that, but it should not take committee time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8829291" data-originallang="en">With respect to the amendment from MP Redekopp, I take as a friendly amendment amending the number of meetings from six to four.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8829292" data-originallang="en">With respect to the other piece related to documentation for Sudan, I'm fine with adding that language for clarity, but this motion speaks to two dates. The first date is January 9, which relates to when the Gaza policy became open. The February 27 date is the Sudan date. I thought incorporating those two dates made it clear that it was for documents related to both Gaza and Sudan, but I don't have any problem whatsoever with adding in the language that MP Redekopp wanted to add in to further clarify that. I just wanted to make it clear that this was already incorporated into the motion to ensure that both Gaza and Sudan documentation was being sought.</p>
