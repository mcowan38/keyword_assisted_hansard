<p data-HoCid="6878810" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, there is a Yiddish proverb that says, “Everything ends in weeping.” I will not say it in Yiddish. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6878811" data-originallang="en">I want to thank the member for <a data-HoCid="278471" href="/politicians/ryan-williams/" title="Ryan Williams">Bay of Quinte</a> for seconding the bill.

It would introduce six weeks of leave for parents who are weeping for the children they lost. It would also introduce five days of leave for miscarriages, three paid days and two unpaid.</p>
