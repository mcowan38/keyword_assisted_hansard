<p data-HoCid="8479458" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479459" data-originallang="en">Thank you to all the witnesses for being here and to all members for studying this important matter.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479460" data-originallang="en">This is a very apt conversation. We're having many important conversations about anti-Semitism. Now it's Pride Month. Our government addresses all forms of discrimination, be it anti-Black or other forms that exist in society. This is an extremely important study, and I want to thank the witnesses, especially those who have gone through personal tragedy, for their strength and courage. I hope their healing process is moving ahead.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479461" data-originallang="en"> I only have about four and a half minutes, so I'm asking for concise answers. I want to start off with Mr. Nalir.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479462" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Nalir, you mentioned the security of institutions—places of worship and community institutions. First off, are you aware of the security infrastructure program? If so—and I'm hoping you'll say yes—do you find it hard to access? Give a simple answer on those fronts.</p>
