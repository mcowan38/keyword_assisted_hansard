<p data-HoCid="6791929" data-originallang="en">Matthias Schmale, UNRWA's director in Gaza, described Israel's attacks as “precise” and “sophisticated”. After making these comments, he was recalled from his post. Hamas effectively demanded that he be fired. What does this say about UNRWA's ability to operate in any way independently? </p>
<p data-HoCid="6791930" data-originallang="en">To follow up on Mr. Morantz's comments, will there be any public reporting on this alleged investigation being done by the <a data-HoCid="253393" href="/politicians/karina-gould/" title="Karina Gould">Minister of International Development</a> with respect to UNRWA?</p>
