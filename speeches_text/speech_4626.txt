<p data-HoCid="8517808" data-originallang="en">To build on what I said in answer to the previous question, the reality right now is that the Houthis have won the civil war in Yemen. They do not control the entire territory of the country, but they control about 60% to 70% of the population. Politically and militarily, they are by far the strongest actor in the country. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8517809" data-originallang="en">That is very bad news for the people of Yemen, because the Houthis have shown themselves to be absolutely brutal in terms of their administration. It's bad news for the region, because now they are exporting that brutality outside the borders of Yemen. We suspected that for years, but now we actually see it in terms of what they're doing in the Red Sea area. The problem is that it is not going to stop. A ceasefire in Gaza, for example, is a separate discussion, and it is not going to stop the Houthi threat to the Red Sea. It is independent of that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8517810" data-originallang="en">From a Canadian perspective, I think we need to support U.S. efforts to counter the Houthis, because that is good for regional security and ultimately for the Yemeni people. How do we do that? It's by participating in the maritime mission in the Red Sea. Even if it's a symbolic participation, as it is now, it's better than nothing. If we ever have a ship to spare—which is not obvious—I think that would be a good idea. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8517811" data-originallang="en">Beyond that, there's not much of a political process in Yemen right now, because the Houthis are not interested in it. </p>
