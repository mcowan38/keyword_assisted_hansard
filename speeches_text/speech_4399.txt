<p data-HoCid="8455559" data-originallang="en"> Through you, Madam Chair, thank you for the question. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8455560" data-originallang="en">These are two points that have been raised with us in all of our discussions with Jewish students and leaders.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455561" data-originallang="en"> On the first point, we helped collect answers to a question in a letter from MPs sent to 27 universities that asked this very question. All respondents—I believe Mr. Housefather might correct me—said that their existing policies would prohibit anti-Semitism. However, what we're hearing from students and faculty is that it's in the enforcement of those codes of conduct in an equal way where they see institutions falling down. There's work to do there. I think better training—picking up on some of Mr. Sandler's points—and better tools for identifying and addressing anti-Semitism will help very much. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8455562" data-originallang="en">On EDI, it's clear there's quite a bit of work to do here to make sure EDI frameworks, policies and administrators are protecting all students, specifically Jewish students and faculty. We have seen examples where changes have already been made, as well as a commitment from all of our universities to continue making changes to reflect the fact that there is now, I think, a growing realization that these policies need to do more to protect Jewish Canadians. </p>
