<p data-HoCid="8299754" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8299755" data-originallang="en">The national monument to Canada's mission in Afghanistan will recognize the commitment and sacrifice of Canadians who served in Afghanistan and the support provided to them at home. The monument will be built in Ottawa, located on the east side of Booth Street, north of the National Holocaust Monument and across the street from the Canadian War Museum.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8299756" data-originallang="en">The National Capital Commission's role in the national monument to Canada's mission in Afghanistan is similar to that of the design and construction of other monuments. The National Capital Commission participates in the site selection, offering sites for a decision by the sponsoring department, and answers as the technical support during the design process. The National Capital Commission will then manage the construction of the monument and its maintenance in the long term.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8299757" data-originallang="en">The National Capital Commission's role in the design competition of this monument was to act as the technical authority and joint contracting authority. In this role, the National Capital Commission managed the technical review of the applicants, ensuring that the designs put forward for consideration met the technical requirements of the site and federal land use, design and transaction approval.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8299758" data-originallang="en">It will be interesting to hear from them about the previous site selection chosen by the Conservative government and also on the process to build the monument.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8299759" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, we heard from veterans at the conclusion of the last meetingâ€”</p>
