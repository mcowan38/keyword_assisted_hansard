<p data-HoCid="8576949" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, the member just said that Israel has a right to defend itself. Israel was attacked by terrorist entities, Hamas and Hezbollah. Today, during question period, a very simple question was put to the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="MÃ©lanie Joly">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a>. The Minister of Foreign Affairs refused to answer it during question period, so I would like to give my hon. colleague an opportunity to do so. It is a very simple question: Does Israel have a right to destroy the terrorist organizations that have attacked it? In other words, does Israel have a right, in the government's view, to destroy Hamas and Hezbollah?</p>
