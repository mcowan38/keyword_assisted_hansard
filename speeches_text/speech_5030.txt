<p data-HoCid="8602478" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, here are today's headlines: “Israeli forces fire on UN peacekeepers in Lebanon”; hundreds of thousands of people are trapped in northern Gaza, ordered to flee with nowhere to go; “Israel seeking to close down Unrwa”; and “Canada's Conservative Leader: Israel Taking Out Iran’s Nuclear Sites Would Be ‘Gift by the Jewish State to Humanity'”. This is crazy. This is enough.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8602479" data-originallang="en"> Canada needs to do everything to de-escalate and to build peace. We need to sanction Netanyahu. We need to have an arms embargo, and we need to recognize Palestine. </p>
