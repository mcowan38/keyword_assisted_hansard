<p data-HoCid="7040221" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chairperson and honourable members of Parliament, for inviting me to appear before this committee to discuss the challenges facing human rights defenders, journalists and media organizations around the world. I'll focus my remarks tonight on specific countries of concern, highlighting patterns in terms of the methods and tools being used to silence independent voices.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7040222" data-originallang="en"> A key goal of repressive states is to erode the checks and balances on their authority. They all read from the same playbook, and inevitably attack any restraints on their power, such as independent journalists, judges, politicians and human rights defenders. How do they do this? They do this by arresting journalists under the guise of publishing fake news; by branding peaceful dissent as terrorism, to bring criminal charges against human rights defenders; by smearing civil society organizations as foreign agents; and by issuing arrest warrants and imposing punitive travel bans and asset freezes on anyone questioning their authority.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7040223" data-originallang="en">These states also seize opportunities like the COVID-19 pandemic to further consolidate their power. As infections and deaths surged, some repressive leaders threatened, silenced or even imprisoned anyone, including health care workers, who criticized their failed response. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7040224" data-originallang="en">These states also use commercial spyware, a powerful tool to monitor and silence anyone who exposes their abuses. Governments have used the spyware Pegasus, developed by the Israel-based company NSO Group, to hack devices of journalists, opposition figures and activists in 45 countries, including a staff member at my organization, Human Rights Watch. This company has been allowed to operate with impunity in the face of overwhelming evidence of abuse.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7040225" data-originallang="en">I'll begin with a few crisis settings of particular concernâ€”namely, Afghanistan, Ethiopia and Venezuela. In Afghanistan, after the Taliban takeover in August, they immediately rolled back women's rights and media freedom. The Taliban beat and detained journalists. Nearly 70% of all Afghan media outlets closed. Others were operating under threat and self-censoring. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7040226" data-originallang="en">In Ethiopia, journalists reporting on the Tigray conflict faced intimidation, expulsion and arrest. Last year, Ethiopian authorities temporarily suspended the Addis Standard, a leading news outlet in Ethiopia, claiming it was advancing the agenda of the Tigray People's Liberation Front. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7040227" data-originallang="en">In Venezuela, the Maduro government has carried out campaigns of stigmatization, harassment and repression against the media. In May of last year, authorities seized the headquarters of the newspaper El Nacional in an apparent effort to silence one of the few remaining independent media outlets in the country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7040228" data-originallang="en">We are also seeing worrying trends in countries that are traditional allies of Canada, including the United Arab Emirates, Israel and India. In the United Arab Emirates, scores of activists, academics and lawyers are serving lengthy sentences following unfair trials on vague and broad charges. The UAE also continues to develop surveillance capabilities, misusing spyware to gain access to the private and encrypted communications of journalists, activists and world leaders.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7040229" data-originallang="en">In Israel, authorities have targeted Palestinians for opposing the occupation, jailing thousands and shutting down dozens of media outlets. Last year, Israeli authorities designated six prominent Palestinian civil society organizations as terrorist and illegal organizations, a move that permits closing their offices, seizing their assets and jailing their staff and supporters.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7040230" data-originallang="en">Finally, in India, critics of the BJP-led government, including activists, journalists, peaceful protesters, and even poets and actors, increasingly risk politically motivated harassment, prosecutions and tax raids. Last year, the government restricted funding for 10 international NGOs working on climate change, the environment and child labour.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7040231" data-originallang="en"> In closing, we ask this committee to urge the government to take several concrete steps to address these growing challenges. The government should condemn any state, including Canada's allies, that seeks to silence independent voices and limits the rights of journalists and human rights defenders to free assembly, association and expression. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7040232" data-originallang="en">To protect these at-risk groups, there's also an urgent need to regulate the global trade in surveillance technology. Canada could be a leader in this space and should ban the sale, export, transfer and use of surveillance technology until human rights safeguards are put in place. Canada should also impose sanctions on commercial spyware companies that are responsible for or complicit in serious human rights abuses by repressive states, until they can demonstrate a change of policy that will end the violations that gave rise to these sanctions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7040233" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much.</p>
