<p data-HoCid="7699229" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7699230" data-originallang="fr">You know me by now. I always preface my remarks to explain what's happening.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7699231" data-originallang="fr">I know that people in Laurentides—Labelle are following these proceedings, including some of my friends and family. Many of them are wondering what's going on. A lot of language keeps coming up: “obstruction”, “need to understand”, “confidence”, “we have to do something”, “people are worried”, “people want to know” and so on.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7699232" data-originallang="fr">This is a fine example of a filibuster. I should even applaud because I'm learning so much. I think I know the right people to call now if I ever want to do any filibustering. Some members are accusing us of filibustering, but I would tell them to look in the mirror before they make such a claim. It's too bad, actually, that they're not here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7699233" data-originallang="fr">People asked what constituted a filibuster. It's almost noon and we started at nine o'clock. When someone takes more than 10 minutes to argue their position before returning to the subject in hand and going off on long tangents about the past but isn't even able to put forward an argument on the current situation or make useful suggestions for the future, that's what you call a filibuster.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7699234" data-originallang="fr">I can say that, because those who saw how I handled myself during the WE Organization study know this is true: there is one person here who can actually say that they are truly acting in the best interests of the people they represent. Allow me to explain. Two things are still true. We all have good intentions. We want to get to the bottom of certain things, find solutions and protect our democracy. We all agree on that. How to go about it is another story.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7699235" data-originallang="fr">The people I think about are the people following these proceedings and my children. Why is this taking so long, they wonder. The reason is that we have a rule permitting members to waste time, and over the course of the next few minutes, perhaps they will surprise us and pull a rabbit out of their hat. Will we get to hear from the ministers and officials between noon and one o'clock? Will the committee take a break and come back in better form? There's question period. We have commitments. Members have been beating around the bush for three hours. I find that hard to swallow, and I would even say I've lost respect for the people who are doing it. I realize it's posturing, which I consider to be a game. What's happening here, though, is no game.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7699236" data-originallang="fr">That was an aside. It only took two minutes, when it could've taken 40.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7699237" data-originallang="fr"> My views regarding the motions on the table are based on many things.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7699238" data-originallang="fr">First of all, why are we so adamant that an independent public inquiry be held? To my mind, “independent” is synonymous with “100% impartial”. That means the person leading the inquiry would be mutually agreed upon. We've spent days demonstrating—and this was even a recommendation—that, together, we can all choose a person to lead the inquiry, an impartial person who can conduct a thorough investigation in order to reassure the public. People are really worried.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7699239" data-originallang="fr">In the public space, much has been said about the Rouleau commission and the impact of its findings. Some have questioned whether there is really a desire to crack down on the issue. I think the question we should be asking is this: Ultimately, what are the benefits of a public commission when part of the proceedings take place in camera? That was the case, after all.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7699240" data-originallang="fr">What happens in that situation? It creates legislative pressure, and that's what we need. Right now, we have to present our argument to the fullest. I realize it can be quite a lot, but how do we get something that's currently stalled moving again?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7699241" data-originallang="fr">The government has shown that measures were taken. I made that point yesterday during question period. That's good, but at this point, today, are those measures enough? Are they appropriate? No. Once you've done everything you can with what you have, it's time to change strategies. You have to go further.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7699242" data-originallang="fr">In softball, you get a few tries before you strike out. One strike, two strikes or three strikes. I won't go into everything that's happened since the government has been in power, but it's not as though this is the first time this has happened and the government has been open and transparent thus far. Now the government is saying that it's time to move forward and that it's appointing a rapporteur. We're past that point now. The trust is broken. The government had every means at its disposal but opted for the power to choose.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7699243" data-originallang="fr">The government needs to show real leadership. It needs to follow the recommendations. That means coming at the issue with the right attitude. As I've often heard said, it's time for the government to step up to the plate. Yes, it can apologize, as it does every time, but it has to show that it is making things right.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7699244" data-originallang="fr">Right now, on this committee, government members are making arguments I don't always understand. I'll explain. We keep hearing—and the previous member just said this—that we shouldn't involve political staffers, that they should be protected. I won't repeat everything that was said because these are very honourable people.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7699245" data-originallang="fr">On the table, we currently have an amendment to bring staff before the committee. National campaign directors are not elected representatives, so I'm at somewhat of a loss. You could say that it's due to the interpretation, but I'm really trying to wrap my head around this. Then again, this is normal. I tell people back home this is normal.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7699246" data-originallang="fr">The government needs to protect our democracy because the situation is critical. We need to get to the truth, and we will. I am telling you, we will.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7699247" data-originallang="fr">We have asked Katie Telford to appear before the committee four times. I was there when she appeared in 2020. I heard her statement and the answers she gave. I wasn't aware that she had also appeared before the Standing Committee on National Defence, but it happened. The members keep bringing up tradition. The idea is to drag this out, and that would be in line with our customs.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7699248" data-originallang="fr">In this case, however, this isn't about tradition. It's about something very serious. In the next few minutes, I'm eager to see whether all of the members here today will stand up and show some humility.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7699249" data-originallang="fr">I may be going too fast for the interpreter, but half the members aren't even listening.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7699250" data-originallang="fr">You are listening, Madam Chair, and what's more, you're looking at me, so thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7699251" data-originallang="fr">Unfortunately, this is what we are having to deal with: members talking, dragging things out and filibustering. Then they say there are important matters we should be dealing with. They're right, so what are we waiting for?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7699252" data-originallang="fr">It's going to take some strong arguments to convince me why I should agree to bringing national campaign directors before the committee, instead of Katie Telford, the Prime Minister's chief of staff. If my fellow members really want to waste time like this, we will meet with all of those people, but I'm going to need a strong case. This is a little discouraging, to put it mildly. Obviously, “little” is an understatement.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7699253" data-originallang="fr">We have 11 minutes left. I'm going to do as I said. Earlier, I said that, when a member goes on for more than 10 minutes, they are beating around the bush. I've been speaking for about 10 minutes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7699254" data-originallang="fr">Hopefully, members will give serious thought to the important points I made and my comments will be good for something. By something, I mean our democracy and confidence in our institutions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7699255" data-originallang="fr">I'm eager to see what happens next.</p>
