<p data-HoCid="6508025" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, we really hope that happens, because as of this morning, Canada is 59th in the world in vaccine administration per capita. The United States has inoculated 63 million people and the U.K. 18 million. Israel has 83% of its population vaccinated, while the government has a measly target that is only going to see 8% of Canadians vaccinated by April. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6508026" data-originallang="en">If 8% and 59th is not good enough for the Israelis, the Brits or the Americans, why in the world does the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> think it is good enough for Canadians?</p>
