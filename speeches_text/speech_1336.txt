<p data-HoCid="6938877" data-originallang="fr">It's a shame, because it was very interesting to hear about this excellence that is found in some places.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6938878" data-originallang="fr">According to the Government of Canada's own data, barely 1% of the Haitian population is fully vaccinated against COVIDâ€‘19. The bulk of the government's contribution is through the COVAX initiative, but we know that it has made bilateral donations based on criteria that we don't quite understand. Since this seems very arbitrary, we have asked that the government prioritize Palestine, Haiti and Taiwan, for a variety of reasons. I think the ones regarding Haiti are obvious to everyone.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6938879" data-originallang="fr">As I was saying, the Canadian government has made bilateral donations without our having a clear understanding of the criteria, including to Egypt and that region, to Jamaica and Barbados, but not to Haiti.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6938880" data-originallang="fr">Why is it that we have not yet helped Haiti with immunization, when they are struggling in every way to try to get out of the pandemic?</p>
<p data-HoCid="6938881" data-originallang="fr">It seems to me that this would be a concrete way to help. What do you think?</p>
