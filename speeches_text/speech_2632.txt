<p data-HoCid="7957638" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, I thank my hon. colleague, a good friend who delivered an excellent speech.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957639" data-originallang="en">At the United Nations and at international organizations there is frequently something that happens, which is Israel being treated differently from everyone else in the community of nations. At the UN Human Rights Council, Israel is the only regular item on their agenda. Israel is disproportionately singled out for condemnation in every UN agency.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957640" data-originallang="en">It seems, with this war, there are some who would treat Israel differently from every other country in terms of its right to self-defence under international law. I am wondering if the hon. member might comment on that issue.</p>
