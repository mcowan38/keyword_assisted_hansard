<p data-HoCid="7683256" data-originallang="en">Mr. Ambassador, I am going to interrupt you. You know the deal. You know that we only have a limited amount of time for our questions, so I want to make sure we don't run out of time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7683257" data-originallang="en">Knowing the reality right now, first of all, I will say that I find the voting has been incredibly inconsistent with the two-state policy, as I've outlined already.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7683258" data-originallang="en"> Extremists within the Israeli government are now in charge of security inside Israel in the occupied territories. They are threatening the annexation of Palestinian territory, which is in violation, as you know, of international law. Just yesterday, the leader of the Israeli government promised to create a militia under the control of the extremist Ben Gvir. The Israeli government is telling us very clearly that it plans to continue to violate international law and the very principles of the United Nations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7683259" data-originallang="en"> How can we continue to justify this?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7683260" data-originallang="en"> One thing I'd also like to point out is that thousands of people in Israel—and, in fact, Jews around the world—are protesting against what the government is doing. Surely, the Canadian government can have the courage to vote with the Israeli people and against some of these very far-right decisions.</p>
