<p data-HoCid="7345750" data-originallang="en"> Madam Chair, while I appreciate the member's deep concern and what she says of being an ally to the Jewish community, as a member of the Jewish community and one who represents one of the largest Jewish communities in the country, many of my community are watching today and have very deep concerns that they would like to hear from the department about the vetting process. While I can appreciate the member's so-called “allyship” to the Jewish community on this issue, by taking up the time of this committee and not allowing all of us, including herself, time to ask these important questions in the time that was made today, it's really not allyship. It's just taking up space.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345751" data-originallang="en">Therefore, while she has duly moved her motion, for the sake of the community that has deep questions it wants to have heard and answered today, I would ask the member to consider permitting that line of questioning with the department that has taken the time to be here to answer and be accountable to myself and to the Jewish community. </p>
