<p data-HoCid="7170296" data-originallang="en">Yes. I am one of the members of the civil board of the Babyn Yar project. Of course, when it happened at the beginning of March, it was a tragedy, and it's a tragedy that we are going through for a second time. As you know, Babyn Yar was the biggest mass grave of Jews killed in eastern Europe, in Ukraine. More than 100,000 people were killed in this place. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7170297" data-originallang="en">Now, when you are faced with this in the 21st century, of course it is difficult. I know from my Jewish friends and from representatives of Jewish organizations in Ukraine that they were shocked by this. Unfortunately, two days ago, for example, a Jewish cemetery in Hlukhiv was bombed. I know that the memorial for Jewish people also was bombed in Kharkiv in April, so we have already three examples of what has happened. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7170298" data-originallang="en"> I think after all the quotes from Minister of Foreign Affairs Lavrov and what he said about the Israel government and that they were helping neo-Nazis.... You know that Putin even asked Bennett to forgive that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7170299" data-originallang="en">For me, it's quite an emotional situation. I'm absolutely shocked this is happening in the 21st century, after what we went through in the 20th century. </p>
