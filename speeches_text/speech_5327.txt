<p data-HoCid="8702950" data-originallang="en">Sure. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8702951" data-originallang="en">I think the first is actually recognition of a Palestinian state by Canada. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8702952" data-originallang="en">I want to say really briefly that the reason it's important is that in past negotiations, in Oslo or in other negotiations, we actually weren't talking about a Palestinian state; we were talking about an autonomous region or what a lot of diplomats and leaders refer to as a “state minus”. There are 146 countries right now that recognize the State of Palestine. As more countries recognize that State of Palestine, it means that when negotiations do happen again, we're not negotiating whether it's a state or something else; we are negotiating, now that we know that it is a state, what that looks like and how we make it happen.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8702953" data-originallang="en">As to how we make it happen, the answers are all there. We have seen these processes happen before. We know that what has been lacking has been leadership—Israeli and Palestinian leadership able to speak to their people and explain why these steps are important. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8702954" data-originallang="en">I would also say that it is important to understand that while there is responsibility on both sides—for both the Israelis and the Palestinians and their leaders to do a better job on this and to be at the negotiating table—we must recognize that in this situation right now, Israel holds the majority of the cards. Israel is in a position of strength. Israel is a sovereign state, whereas Palestinians are stateless people who are divided between Hamas and the Palestinian leadership. We have to be able to recognize where the systems work in advantages and disadvantages, and put the pressure on both peoples accordingly. </p>
