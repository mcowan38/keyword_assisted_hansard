<p data-HoCid="7988229" data-originallang="en">I think in part it's the numbers, initially. I think we have fewer Canadians, permanent residents and family members in the West Bank and Gaza who are seeking help. I would say that right now we know this group very well. It's a smaller group. We've been reaching out directly to them by phone and by email to stay in touch and to understand what assistance they require from us.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988230" data-originallang="en">In Israel the numbers were initially very large, but we've watched those numbers decrease as the situation calms in Israel proper. Those calls are becoming quite reduced. Certainly our numbers of affected persons have significantly decreased. Right now we have just over 150 individuals in Israel who are identifying themselves as affected persons who require support from us. That is a much, much smaller number than we had a week ago.</p>
