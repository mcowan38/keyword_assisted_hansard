<p data-HoCid="8693728" data-originallang="en"> My questions are for Professor Waxman and build off his opening statement.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693729" data-originallang="en">What territory would this state have? Would it include all of the West Bank, as traditionally delineated by the 1968 borders, or not? </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693730" data-originallang="en">Second, who would the citizens of this state be? Would it include the some two million Israeli Arabs and other Palestinians in Jordan and elsewhere? </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693731" data-originallang="en">Third, what entity would be considered the government of that state?</p>
