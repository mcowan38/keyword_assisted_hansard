<p data-HoCid="6231398" data-originallang="en">What a great question. We've been wrestling with this. You know, in December we're going to have the 50th anniversary of the status of women commission's report. We've been talking about this issue for 50 years, along with child care.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6231399" data-originallang="en">I don't have a quick answer for you. I think it's really problematic to pay people for what was unpaid work. We already have tax credits for caregivers. I'm very nervous that women will settle for, essentially, a very small stipend to do unpaid work and set back women's equality by decades. That's my personal fear, but I also recognize that maybe I'm fetishizing paid work. I don't know. You're raising one of these unbelievably difficult needles to thread, so kudos to you. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6231400" data-originallang="en">Is there something else that the federal government can do? You bet. One thing the federal government can do is to walk what it's talking on 10 paid sick days. It's telling the provinces to do 10 paid sick days, but it itself, in its own jurisdiction, does not lead by example. It could be doing that in its own jurisdiction, which is about 7% of the labour market. It would make a big difference to some people.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6231401" data-originallang="en">We need to regulate the gig economy more because we know it is going to bust open. In the wake of COVID, we're going to have much more on-demand work, and it's an essentially unregulated sector of the labour market. We need 21st-century regulations to govern this work, which is not as gendered as you'd think. Sometimes, when people think about the gig economy, they think about Uber drivers. Women are going to stay at home and do TaskRabbit and Mechanical Turk and stuff like that if they don't get child care. More women are going to do this kind of work. It is unregulated. People earn less than the minimum wage.</p>
