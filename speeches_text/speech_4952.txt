<p data-HoCid="8604937" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8604938" data-originallang="en">On to another topic, I know that B'nai Brith put out a statement back in the spring that they were very concerned that the federal government had chosen to reinstate funding for UNRWA. The record of UNRWA is pretty clear. For years we've known that they have anti-Semitic school materials, where they teach children to hate Israel and to hate Jews. They show them maps without Israel even being on the map. Those reports were put forward by IMPACT-se and have been widely reviewed. Then revelations came out about employees of UNRWA who participated in the October 7 massacres.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8604939" data-originallang="en">Most recently, in the counterattack of Israel in Lebanon, a fellow named Fatah Sharif Abu al Amin, a senior Hamas leader in Lebanon, was killed, but the revelation came out that he was also the head of the UNRWA teachers union, which is not a small, low-level position. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8604940" data-originallang="en">Are you even more concerned than you were in the spring that the Canadian government should not be funding UNRWA?</p>
