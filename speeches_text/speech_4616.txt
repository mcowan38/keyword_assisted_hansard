<p data-HoCid="8499320" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Emon and Ms. Zine, my question is for both of you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8499321" data-originallang="fr">Currently, certain provisions of section 319 of the Criminal Code prohibit the promotion of hatred or anti-Semitism. In two cases, the code provides what is referred to as a religious exemption. Paragraphs 319(3)(b) and 319(3.1)(b) state that “no person shall be convicted of an offence … if, in good faith, the person expressed or attempted to establish by an argument an opinion on a religious subject or an opinion based on a belief in a religious text”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8499322" data-originallang="fr">That means that promoting hatred and anti-Semitism is prohibited under the Criminal Code, but if it is done on the basis of a religious opinion or text, there would be a reasonable defence.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8499323" data-originallang="fr">Briefly, what are your thoughts on that?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8499324" data-originallang="fr">I've finished my question and I have a minute left.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8499325" data-originallang="fr">Ms. Zine, can you answer in 30 seconds?</p>
