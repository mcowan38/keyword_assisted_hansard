<p data-HoCid="8576904" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, in the member's speech just now, she spoke about October 7. That was a horrific day. We all agree that was a horrendous terrorist act that was perpetrated against Israel. However, it is not where it started. I think we can all agree that things have happened and that there has been conflict in that region for a very long time. I know that the ICJ has brought forward a ruling that said that the occupation of the West Bank by Israel is illegal.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576905" data-originallang="en"> I would like to know from the member what the Conservative Party's position is with regard to international law. Do the Conservative Party of Canada and this member support the ICC and the ICJ in all circumstances and not just pick and choose as we have seen from other administrations?</p>
