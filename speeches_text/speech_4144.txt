<p data-HoCid="8406258" data-originallang="en">I think that's an excellent question. I thank you for posing it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8406259" data-originallang="en">To make something legitimate, it doesn't have to be posed against something else. Let me give you an example.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8406260" data-originallang="en">The moon and the sun both exist, but not at the same time. One rises, one sets.

There are more people out there who have tried to destroy the Jewish population. They have enslaved the Jews and have murdered the Jews, but here's one thing that's not going to happen, and this is the message for each of you. These people are our future. We will not accept it. We will not tolerate it. If you want to create new laws, start enforcing the existing laws, and maybe we'll get somewhere.</p>
