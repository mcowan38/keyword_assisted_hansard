<p data-HoCid="8592295" data-originallang="en"> We will be supporting the motion as it was presented, which then is tacitly that we don't want to entertain the amendment, because we will be getting into issues that we think should be debated in the study.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8592296" data-originallang="en">There are issues that are there around the negotiated settlement and all of those things. Of course, we believe in Israel and its statehood, so we're not going to go there. We believe that the motion can stand to get us into the study and put us into a difficult study. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8592297" data-originallang="en">I'm not saying that it's going to be easy. We'll disagree. We'll have disagreements on our own side. You'll have disagreements on other sides. I believe that, but the world needs the Canadian Parliament to advise the Canadian government on the timing and conditions that we think will be best suited for lasting and just peace.</p>
