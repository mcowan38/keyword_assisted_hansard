<p data-HoCid="6912306" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I stand again with a very heavy heart, as I did a few days ago, to speak on behalf of my constituents, who are going through an incredibly terrible time right now because of the unpeaceful protests that are taking place on the residential streets of downtown Ottawa.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6912307" data-originallang="en">I have to say that I was so disappointed to see the Conservative members standing outside and cheering these protesters who are taking peace away from people who live in this community. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6912308" data-originallang="en">I am going to very quickly read an email that I received from one of my constituents. She wrote, “I am again horrified seeing our holy Jewish Star of David sported on jackets, desecrated by anti-vaxxers, which, along with the swastikas on flags, is terrifying for me and unspeakable for anyone who cares.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="6912309" data-originallang="en">Let us give them back their peace and end this protest.</p>
