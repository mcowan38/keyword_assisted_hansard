<p data-HoCid="6092191" data-originallang="en">Okay. Here's where we are. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6092192" data-originallang="en">The original motion moved by Ms. Gazan was that we ask the four ministers to testify before the committee for one hour per minister to explain their mandate letters. That was the original motion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6092193" data-originallang="en">Mr. Vaughan proposed an amendment that said that two of the ministers would come in for one meeting, and the other two would come in for another meeting, to speak to main estimates and their mandate letters for two hours. That's a summary of the amendment.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6092194" data-originallang="en">Mr. Housefather indicated that the amended motion is now a bit redundant, because in the first half of the original motion we talk about inviting ministers, and in the second half we say it again. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6092195" data-originallang="en">I guess what we're going to do now is to adopt a subamendment. It's really a second amendment.</p>
