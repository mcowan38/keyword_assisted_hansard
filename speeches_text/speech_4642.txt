<p data-HoCid="8510033" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8510034" data-originallang="fr">I would also like to thank the witnesses for being with us this morning.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8510035" data-originallang="fr">I think all of your testimony is important and deserves much more time than the little time we are spending on it, unfortunately. I will have only six minutes, so please allow me to be a little strict on the time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8510036" data-originallang="fr">This is not our first meeting on Islamophobia, and we've also had meetings on anti-Semitism. I feel that you have similar situations on both sides. At least, you are telling us about similar cases of discrimination, which are appalling, harmful and must absolutely be combatted.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8510037" data-originallang="fr">Ms. Elghawaby, could you explain to me, in 30 seconds to a minute, how you see the situation and why there are so many links between anti-Semitism and Islamophobia?</p>
