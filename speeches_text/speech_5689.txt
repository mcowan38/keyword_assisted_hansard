<p data-HoCid="8783203" data-originallang="fr"> We have already done a number of things. As I said, in the 43rd Parliament, we passed Bill <a data-HoCid="12830843" href="/bills/44-1/C-373/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (promotion of hatred or antisemitism)">Câ€‘3</a>, which requires that new judges receive training on sexual assault. In the current Parliament, we have also passed Bill <a data-HoCid="12367527" href="/bills/44-1/S-12/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code, the Sex Offender Information Registration Act and the International Transfer of Offenders Act">S-12</a>; that bill restored the National Sex Offender Registry, which focuses particularly on predators who attack women.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8783204" data-originallang="fr">We have also twice made changes to bail. This affects victims of intimate partner violence. It involves Bill <a data-HoCid="9745407" href="/bills/42-1/C-75/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code, the Youth Criminal Justice Act and other Acts and to make consequential amendments to other Acts">C-75</a>, which was passed in an earlier Parliament, and Bill <a data-HoCid="12426046" href="/bills/44-1/C-48/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (bail reform)">C-48</a>, which was passed during the current Parliament. So we have done a number of things.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8783205" data-originallang="fr">What bothers me a bit, and concerns me, is that on the provinces' part, we see situations where victims of sexual harassment or sexual assault are not able to be heard by a judge and argue their case, to make the accused answer for their acts, because the provinces are not investing enough money, and this results in unreasonable delays. A number of articles have been written recently about the problem in this regard in Ontario.</p>
