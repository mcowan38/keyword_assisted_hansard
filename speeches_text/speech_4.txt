<p data-HoCid="6027051" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, today is International Holocaust Remembrance Day and the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the death camps. We join with survivors all around the world to remember the atrocities that were committed against them, their families and their communities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6027052" data-originallang="en">It is important to remember those who were murdered and the survivors of these unimaginable crimes, but we must also commit to standing up against intolerance and hateful speech wherever we find them. We are seeing a rise in divisive rhetoric and attacks on synagogues and religious freedoms. It is more important than ever to say “never again” and put meaning to those words.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6027053" data-originallang="en">We must stand together for the rights and dignity of all people. Together we must act to call out prejudice and hate wherever we see it. It is the only way we can truly make “never again” a reality.</p>
