<p data-HoCid="6813967" data-originallang="en">This is a very serious matter, so I don't want to treat any of it lightly. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6813968" data-originallang="en"> I did want to focus on the fact that if we're going to do this, I don't know if we're going to be able to finish this IMVE study. There are lots of contentions or contortions about all the various aspects of it that we've already wondered about, whether they're ideologically motivated or religiously motivated or whatever. I would prefer to ask both of the proposed witnesses—and I don't disagree with the witnesses—to come and ask them specifically. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6813969" data-originallang="en">We know the horrors of anti-Semitism and the effects thereof, as well as clearly what's before us, the horrors of what's called Islamophobia, which is literally the fear of Islam. I think it's really more of an Islamic hatred than a phobia. I don't know where that name actually came from. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6813970" data-originallang="en">What I would like to do is to ask these individuals to address that question specifically: What is it that they would like to see us report or recommend to government from the various ideas that are out there? We can do something specific on that, which may result in a motion to do <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, and <em>d</em>, but do that separately, not as part of the larger study, because all these other questions start coming into it then. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6813971" data-originallang="en">There are lots of things out there. People want to see a crackdown on hate speech on the Internet. There are various things I've heard. Let's ask them what they think we should recommend, and compress it, not into part of a study that we may or may not get to finish, because events seem to overtake committee business during this time of the calendar. Let's see if we can do it, even if we hear witnesses on one day and explore options, and then on another day, the second day, listen to proposals and try to do a mini report or motion that would contain several proposals. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6813972" data-originallang="en">That would be much more preferable to me, and I think much more doable and efficient than just carrying on with that study that may never get to Parliament because of the time involved for translation and reports and all that goes with it. </p>
