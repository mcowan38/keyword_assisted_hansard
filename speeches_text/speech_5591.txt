<p data-HoCid="8726581" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, the very basic thing that any government can do about this is to signal that it is wrong, but we cannot expect even that from the current government. The <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> danced the night away and waited until noon the next day to say anything about the lawless behaviour in his own city. The very start of this should be at least a condemnation and should be to make sure that these rioters face the full extent of the law. They are not peaceful protesters. There is a very clear line between protest in this country and lawless mob behaviour, and that line was crossed on Friday night and on many other weekends in this country, when people feel unsafe in their own communities. There is terrorist cosplay; flags of terrorist organizations are flying in neighbourhoods where Jewish communities live. Any government would say that is unacceptable, but leadership would say that it is absolutely unacceptable and that those people should be arrested.</p>
