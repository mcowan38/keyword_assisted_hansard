<p data-HoCid="8301031" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Madam Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8301032" data-originallang="en">Thank you to Mr. Housefather for your courage in standing up for the Jewish community and putting forward this motion. I think it's a very important study, and I support that we undertake that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301033" data-originallang="en">In my home province of British Columbia, at my university, the University of British Columbia, there was a referendum or a threat of one recently to terminate the lease that Hillel House has had on campus for many years. It's a very significant presence in the university. It is a haven for the Jewish student body there. Thankfully, the referendum didn't go ahead, with the good leadership of the student association; but just the fact that the referendum was even suggested, I think, has been very disturbing for not only people in my home province of British Columbia but throughout the country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301034" data-originallang="en">The motion also would have included BDS sanctions—boycott, divestment and sanctions—against Israel and anything to do with Israel, and that's just the newest form of anti-Semitism. I find it all very disturbing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301035" data-originallang="en">I'm very supportive of having this study to better understand what is going on here in Canada with anti-Semitism, which is something I never thought I would see in my lifetime, and also to demonstrate to the Jewish community that we stand with them and that they are an important part of Canadian culture. </p>
