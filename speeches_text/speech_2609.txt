<p data-HoCid="7957533" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, I will ask again. The leader of the NDP used words like “revenge”, “genocide” and “collective punishment”. It sounds like he has walked those back after his prepared remarks.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957534" data-originallang="en">I am going to ask him one more time if he believes, and this is a serious matter, that Israel is committing or is about to commit a genocide. Yes or no?</p>
