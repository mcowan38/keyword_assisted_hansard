<p data-HoCid="8291188" data-originallang="en">I wish to move a motion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8291189" data-originallang="en">At this point in time, having indicated that I wish to move a motion, I'll just say thank you so much to the witnesses for being here with us today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8291190" data-originallang="en">I realize that this is a bit disruptive, but unfortunately, with the way the committee is structured, the only opportunity we have to move a motion is when we're in public, which is when we have witnesses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8291191" data-originallang="en">The motion that I wish to move is: </p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8291192" data-originallang="en"> Given that, </p>
<p data-HoCid="8291193" data-originallang="en"> According to the 2021-22 and 2022-23 Public Accounts, The Department of Canadian Heritage has issued transfer payments to the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council in the sum total of $600,000 and $569,353 respectively, and that, </p>
<p data-HoCid="8291194" data-originallang="en"> The Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council awarded a February 2022 Connection Grant in the sum of $24,999 in which the main applicant and speakers at the conference for which funding was granted have publicly expressed antisemitic views, including calling for a “global intifada” and support for designated terrorist organizations in Canada, and that, </p>
<p data-HoCid="8291195" data-originallang="en"> The Department of Canadian Heritage has confirmed the implementation of an anti-racism declaration as a condition of funding in their grant applications, and that, </p>
<p data-HoCid="8291196" data-originallang="en"> The Government of Canada has committed to the Canada Anti-Racism Strategy; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8291197" data-originallang="en"> Pursuant to Standing Order 108(2), the Committee: </p>
<p data-HoCid="8291198" data-originallang="en"> Invite the Ministers of Canadian Heritage and Innovation, Science &amp; Economic Development for a minimum of two hours each, to discuss the repeated and systemic awarding of grant funding to individuals or organizations expressing antisemitic views; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8291199" data-originallang="en"> Recommend the Government of Canada immediately conduct a whole of government review of grant applications to include an anti-racism declaration as a condition of funding, and </p>
<p data-HoCid="8291200" data-originallang="en"> Report its findings to the House. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8291201" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, the reason this motion is so important to move today is that a group within the University of Alberta was granted this money.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8291202" data-originallang="en">We know that anti-racism in Canada is on the rise—</p>
