<p data-HoCid="8692205" data-originallang="en"> I'm going to continue, because I couldn't get a point out before you called irrelevance on me, Madam Chair. I know that you may not like the facts of the matter, but that doesn't mean that you can censure a member and in any way ask a member of the House of Commons to leave a committee. I think that's out of line, and I'm going to put that on the record.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8692206" data-originallang="en">All of that is to say that we were going to get to a study on anti-Semitism in which members of this committee heard from witnesses from across the country, and I'll make my point again, because I was interrupted a number of times. Since that study, we have only seen this issue get worse in this country, so it is astounding to me that members of this committee who were part of that study and who purport to take this issue seriously don't want to get to the study. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8692207" data-originallang="en">As such, and to prove that.... First of all, I don't have to prove that the issue has gotten worse in this country, because it has. All you have to do is look at the encampments on university campuses, the shootings in cities and the violence in the streets, but since the committee doesn't want to get there, I have a motion to prove to everybody at home that this committee is blocking the study of anti-Semitism.</p>
