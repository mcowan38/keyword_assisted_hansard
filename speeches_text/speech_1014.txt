<p data-HoCid="6771804" data-originallang="en">Seeing no other hands raised, can we move to one of the other outstanding items? We will bring this back before the committee the next time we have committee business.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6771805" data-originallang="en">We have witnesses invited for the next two meetings, although I see a “to be determined” on the Tuesday panel. If that slot hasn't been filled, we may be able to have three sets of witnesses for one panel and leave some time at the end. That would be one solution. If not, we'll see what we can do on Thursday, June 3.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6771806" data-originallang="en">For the next item, you have a budget before you for approval with respect to the study we are currently undertaking, which is the impact of COVID-19 on seniors. It's a budget of $4,300. When we last discussed it, a couple of questions were posed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6771807" data-originallang="en">One was around the possibility of an honorarium and tobacco for indigenous elders who will be included among the witnesses that come before us. With respect to that, the clerk has done a bit of research and has indicated that there is a policy on the issuance of gifts from the official gift bank, which limits the issuance of gifts to either travelling committees or foreign delegations coming before the committee. This would be contrary to that policy. I would also point out as a matter of interest that this isn't something that is done at the indigenous affairs committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6771808" data-originallang="en">I'm happy to entertain further discussion on this. If there is none, I would ask for a motion that the budget be adopted as presented.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6771809" data-originallang="en">Ms. Gazan, please.</p>
