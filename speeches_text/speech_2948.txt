<p data-HoCid="7974827" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the horrific events in Israel and Gaza should not be used to support a particular cause. Innocent people have been killed. No one should use those deaths to justify more violence. Calling for a boycott of a Toronto business just because it is owned by a Jew is repulsive. Defacing offices of MPs or MPPs serves nothing. Hatred and intimidation do not advance the search for a just and durable peace in the Middle East.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7974828" data-originallang="en">Can the <a data-HoCid="300017" href="/politicians/dominic-leblanc/" title="Dominic LeBlanc">Minister of Public Safety</a> ensure that Canada's hate laws are being upheld and that violent protests are not being permitted?</p>
