<p data-HoCid="8482938" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, just three years after a London family was murdered in an Islamophobic attack, another London family's home was set on fire. The police are investigating this crime as hate-motivated as the family had publicly expressed support for Palestinian human rights. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8482939" data-originallang="en">Islamophobia, anti-Palestinian racism and all forms of hate must be condemned wherever it occurs, and the government needs to do more to root out racism so people can feel safe. Will the Liberals finally step up to provide support to my community and all those impacted by hate-motivated attacks?</p>
