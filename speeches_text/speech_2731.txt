<p data-HoCid="7961937" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I noticed that the hon. member spent a lot of time on sponsored travel, so I would like to ask him a question. In 2022, he took a trip to Berlin, Germany that cost $10,500. The trip was paid for by the FES, partnered with politicized NGOs, to attack Israel, SHAML, a radical anti-Israel NGO, and Mossawa, which is one of the main Israeli Arab NGOs involved in the political demonization of Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7961938" data-originallang="en">He held a joint press conference with Hezbollah in 2004 and HDIP, which promotes international political attacks on Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7961939" data-originallang="en">How could he justify that?</p>
