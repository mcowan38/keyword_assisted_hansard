<p data-HoCid="7968760" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, my friend Paul in Quebec City will be happy to know that the year one budget has brought the debate on Quebec independence to the Parliament of Canada, and that even the <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">Leader of the Opposition</a> is talking about it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7968761" data-originallang="fr">In the meantime, the Prime Minister has put himself at odds with the United States, U.S. intelligence and the U.S. President on the issue of the hospital in Gaza. According to the information available to us, he has not spoken with the U.S. President in 17 days. What does he plan to do to convince the U.S. to rally to the consensus reached by the UN, the European Union and France for a humanitarian truce in Gaza?</p>
