<p data-HoCid="7770379" data-originallang="en"> Can I jump in on that very quickly?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7770380" data-originallang="en">Dr. Leblond brought this up earlier and I was really itching to jump in. He brought up something very important that he talked about in his last appearance, and I'm going to use slightly different language to say the same thing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7770381" data-originallang="en">What he was talking about was the phenomenon of the past 20 to 25 years of the unbundling of the corporation or the unbundling of the value chain. Ronald Coase won a Nobel Prize at the University of Chicago asking why firms exist. He said they're a bundle of value-creating activities. What we've learned, because of the incredible power of IT, is that corporations today in their corporate strategies can bundle, rebundle, unbundle and sell off this asset without shutting down the firm or selling the firm out in an IPO.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7770382" data-originallang="en">As your committee starts to go down that rabbit hole of saying, not only do we want to regulate the corporate entity, which I do understand.... When you start saying, I want to regulate the IP of the entity and maybe this mine of it, you're getting deep into the value chain and the corporate and business strategic decision-making of individual corporations. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7770383" data-originallang="en">First, I don't think that's your role as parliamentarians, and second, even if you decide it's your role, I think you're going to have hell on earth trying to become such a macro-micro regulator. You're getting deep into the corporate and business strategic decisions of what assets they need to maximize value creation. When you start getting down to that, I understand your motives and I understand your intent, but I just think you're talking about very large numbers of companies. They're very complex and they're very sophisticated, and I think you're going to find it devilishly difficult.</p>
