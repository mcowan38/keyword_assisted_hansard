<p data-HoCid="8752282" data-originallang="en">I'm not moving it right now. I just want to read what I would be proposing. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8752283" data-originallang="en">It reads:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8752284" data-originallang="en"> Pursuant to Standing Order 108(2), and given the growing trend of violent extremism, in particular, the increase in youth involvement, the committee invite Brigitte Gauvin, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) deputy commissioner for national security, representatives of the RCMP's federal policing integrated national security enforcement team, Robert Burley, executive director of the Canada Centre for Community Engagement and Prevention of Violence, officials from Public Safety Canada and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, representatives from TikTok, X, Snapchat, Discord, Reddit, Facebook, Telegram, Minecraft and Roblox to discuss the foiled terrorist plot against the Ottawa Jewish community, the rise of violent extremism, including anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, recent measures the federal government has undertaken to address it, and the role that social media and gaming platforms play in radicalizing youth and mobilizing violence. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8752285" data-originallang="en"> Chair, I could amend Mr. Morantz's motion to reflect what I would like to bring forward, but given that we have summoned this witness to be with us today, I'd like to move that we adjourn debate. We can return to it at a future meeting.</p>
