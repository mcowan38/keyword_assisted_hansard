<p data-HoCid="8594883" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, one year ago, over 1,000 Israelis were killed in a terror attack by Hamas. Since then, Netanyahu's regime has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and victimized hundreds of thousands in the region. As long as this continues, so too does the harm in our Canadian communities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8594884" data-originallang="en"> Over the past year, our local synagogue has had to ask police for support during Shabbat and this past weekend during Rosh Hashanah. Palestinian Canadians who have lost entire generations of family members are afraid to grieve openly and continue to be targeted for their heritage. This is unacceptable.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8594885" data-originallang="en"> No matter one's identity, people deserve to feel safe and to be able to grieve in our country. This is not a political issue; this is a humanity issue. If members in this House continue to make this tragic loss a partisan issue, we risk losing a part of our own humanity.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8594886" data-originallang="en"> Today is a horrific anniversary for Jewish and Palestinian Canadians alike. Today is a day of grief.</p>
