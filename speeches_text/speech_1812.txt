<p data-HoCid="7269715" data-originallang="fr">Thank you very much for that important question, Ms. Gazan. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7269716" data-originallang="fr">We have heard initiatives from members of the government. But initiatives go hand in hand with political will or political colour. The day we have our own autonomous governments, that will be another answer.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7269717" data-originallang="fr">Before we get to that point, the federal, provincial and territorial governments have responsibilities. We need to change the culture and the way things are done in government. If there are no laws that impose accountability, transparency and forms of penalties to ensure respect for human rights, particularly in the areas of public health, individual health and safety, and if these rights are only taken into account in one-off initiatives, we will unfortunately see the same thing next year and in 10 years. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7269718" data-originallang="fr">We don't know the laws and we don't see them. They need to have teeth, so that there is zero tolerance for any form of violence.</p>
