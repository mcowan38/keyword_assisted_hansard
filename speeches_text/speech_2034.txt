<p data-HoCid="7516931" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to all my colleagues for their tributes to our colleague and friend, Jim Carr. I am especially grateful to the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, the member for <a data-HoCid="278781" href="/politicians/marty-morantz/" title="Marty Morantz">Charleswood—St. James—Assiniboia—Headingley</a>, the member for <a data-HoCid="278406" href="/politicians/kristina-michaud/" title="Kristina Michaud">Avignon—La Mitis—Matane—Matapédia</a> and the member for <a data-HoCid="278628" href="/politicians/richard-cannings/" title="Richard Cannings">South Okanagan—West Kootenay</a> for their words.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7516932" data-originallang="fr">I think everyone felt the same feelings because we lost someone dear to us, someone we all loved very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7516933" data-originallang="en">I had the great honour to know Jim for quite a long time. We got to know each other through an organization that is playing quite a role here at COP15. The International Institute for Sustainable Development is based in Winnipeg. Jim was a member of the board, and I overlapped with him on the board for five years, beginning in 2000. He went on to be the vice-chair of the International Institute for Sustainable Development, and I saw the influence of that experience in working on sustainable development in his work in Parliament. It bound us together as friends before we met in the chamber as fellow members of Parliament.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7516934" data-originallang="en">There have been many words said about Jim's enormous depth of character and his range of interests, none of them superficial. Imagine being interested in music and being able to play oboe at a symphony orchestra; being concerned with the rights of people around the world and serving to meet those ends in Parliament.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7516935" data-originallang="en">In his work for the community, particularly to the member for <a data-HoCid="278781" href="/politicians/marty-morantz/" title="Marty Morantz">Charleswood—St. James—Assiniboia—Headingley</a> I want to mention knowing what a strong advocate for the Jewish community Jim Carr always was, with his Russian-Jewish ancestors having come to Canada in 1906. He never forgot those roots.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7516936" data-originallang="en">Jim was also, of course, a journalist. So much has been mentioned that I can think of only one thing that has not been shared yet, but I think a lot of us knew it. Jim was really funny. He had a killer sense of humour. He could perhaps have been a professional impersonator. I do not know how many members ever got to see his quite killing imitation of JFK. He had Kennedyesque looks, and he pulled off a Boston accent like nobody's business. He was enormously gifted, and he shared those talents with us all.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7516937" data-originallang="en">The president of the International Institute for Sustainable Development, Richard Florizone, said in the statement from that organization that Jim was “the rare polymath”. That is a tribute to the ways in which he was able to come into our lives, into policy, into politics, into the arts, into community, into business, and never superficially. He has left an enormous impact throughout his life on so many different facets of our society. No doubt, the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> is exactly right: He loved this country, every inch of it. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7516938" data-originallang="en">I will cherish the memory, but it is almost impossible to believe it was only seven days ago that I hugged Jim next to his desk when Bill <a data-HoCid="11537455" href="/bills/44-1/C-235/" title="An Act respecting the building of a green economy in the Prairies">C-235</a> passed. It was a distinct honour, and one I do not take for granted, that he asked me to be his official seconder. It is rare to ask someone who is not in one's own party to second one's bill, but I hold it as a cherished memory. I never would have believed that when I hugged him to congratulate him on Bill C-235, the building a green prairie economy act, it was the last time I would get to hug him. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7516939" data-originallang="en">We knew his days were not many, but each day made a difference, as he said every day he passed my desk to walk down to take his spot in the front row. I would say, “Jim, how are you?” He would say, “Every day is a blessing.” Let us remember his words and live our lives to be worthy of that knowledge, that every day is a blessing. Let us use each day as a blessing in the service of our Lord, whatever faith we follow. Let us remember that every day is a blessing. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7516940" data-originallang="en">We are honoured to have known Jim and to have loved him. I will miss him. I give my deepest condolences and sympathy to Colleen and all the family.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7516941" data-originallang="fr">I thank all my colleagues for this opportunity to share a few words in honour of the great human, the great Canadian, the <em>mensch</em> we lost.</p>
