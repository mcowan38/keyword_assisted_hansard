<p data-HoCid="8805453" data-originallang="fr"> As you say, recruiting and retaining staff calls for a lot of work and is very expensive. Let's talk about early childhood first. Do you believe the federal government has a role to play? Obviously, we know that funds have been promised, and I want to recognize the work done by my colleague <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Leah Gazan</a> on this subject, when Bill <a data-HoCid="12138647" href="/bills/44-1/C-35/" title="An Act respecting early learning and child care in Canada">C-35</a> was enacted. Do you think the federal government has a role to play, or has some responsibility, when it comes to ensuring that child care centre directors and school boards that assist child care centres have permanent funding to enable them to do staff recruitment and training?</p>
