<p data-HoCid="6791794" data-originallang="en">I absolutely agree that peacebuilding is fundamental to getting to a different place. What was so alarming about the crisis.... There were many things, but one of them was that you had violence in Jerusalem and you had violence throughout the West Bank, and really the issues of social cohesion and getting to a place where you can even envisage two peoples living together side by side in peace and security were a long way from that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6791795" data-originallang="en">We really need to build within communities a feeling of harmony and acceptance. That's what we endeavour to do with our partners and with this approach. As was mentioned, we have been doing a bit of peacebuilding and working with NGOs, bringing disparate groups together to try to make a difference. We will continue that practice and, I think, amplify it in a number of key ways, having groups come together and discuss openly the issues, the frictions, the challenges and finding a way forward for that harmony.</p>
