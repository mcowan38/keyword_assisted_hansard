<p data-HoCid="8374537" data-originallang="en">Just to build on what we were talking about before and in terms of the private side and our arms trade treaties, we've talked a lot about China, but what about the other players around the world? Could you expand more on North Korea, Iran and India? </p>
<p data-HoCid="8374538" data-originallang="en">Canada does a lot of trade with countries like Israel in terms of the space domain. We've now put forward a motion to really heighten our arms trade controls and those arms trade treaties. Within two minutes, can you speak to that and to what that means in terms of space and those other players on the world front?</p>
