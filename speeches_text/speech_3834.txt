<p data-HoCid="8303207" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303208" data-originallang="en">Mr. Marceau, you talked about that vetting process in terms of who's allowed into Parliament and so on. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8303209" data-originallang="en">In the first meeting we had on this study, it was made very clear by all those involved with security, protocol and so on that this was not done. The Speaker did his own thing. It didn't go through the proper channels. Obviously, we need to determine that this needs to be corrected as a protocol, despite who was involved. You also talked about that meeting of the Palestinian friendship group and letting somebody in. I, too, was very upset that this occurredâ€”not wanting to allow that kind of access.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303210" data-originallang="en">My question is this. There are a lot of events on the Hill. They are held by members of Parliament. They are held by groups. They are held by organizations such as CJA itself. How do we truly do a good job of vetting when there are so many things happening? Is that solely upon the government? Is that solely upon our own security personnel? Is that to be a responsibility of the groups that are running these events as well?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303211" data-originallang="en"> How do you think that should play out?</p>
