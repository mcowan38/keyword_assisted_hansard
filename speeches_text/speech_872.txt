<p data-HoCid="6620810" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Beaches—East York, I speak today in support of Bill <a data-HoCid="11007812" href="/bills/43-2/C-15/" title="An Act respecting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">C-15</a>. I want to start by acknowledging the work of former NDP member Romeo Saganash. It really highlights how the importance of this issue cuts across party lines, and the significance of working across party lines to get important things done.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6620811" data-originallang="en"> I have had many constituents reach out to me in support of implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Most, of course, email or write letters. Some call. Before the election in the last Parliament, when Bill <a data-HoCid="8160636" href="/bills/42-1/C-262/" title="An Act to ensure that the laws of Canada are in harmony with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">C-262</a>, Romeo Saganash's bill, was before us, I had a constituent, Murray Lumley, who came and met with me in my office and called on me to support that bill, which I did, and encouraged the government of the day to support it. Murray is a thoughtful, caring constituent. He did not vote for me; he worked against me, if I am being honest, in the last election, and I do not expect he will vote for me whenever the next election might be. However, I do want to highlight his efforts, all the same, just as I have highlighted Romeo's efforts. It is important that we emphasize just how this cuts across party lines and how all of us, regardless of political stripe, need to support this really important legislation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6620812" data-originallang="en">When we work across party lines, we build trust. Another way we build trust in politics is by keeping our promises. I just want to highlight the platform that we ran on in the last election, which stated:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="6620813" data-originallang="en"> Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission said that the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples charts a path “for reconciliation to flourish in 21st century Canada.”... </p>
<p data-HoCid="6620814" data-originallang="en"> We will move forward with introducing co-developed legislation to implement [UNDRIP] as government legislation by the end of 2020. In this work, we will ensure that this legislation fully respects the intent of the Declaration, and establishes Bill C-262 as the floor, rather than the ceiling, when it comes to drafting this new legislation. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="6620815" data-originallang="en">That promise has been kept through Bill <a data-HoCid="11007812" href="/bills/43-2/C-15/" title="An Act respecting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">C-15</a>, which was introduced in Parliament in December of last year.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6620816" data-originallang="en"> In substance, Bill <a data-HoCid="11007812" href="/bills/43-2/C-15/" title="An Act respecting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">C-15</a> has a lengthy preamble, including that:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="6620817" data-originallang="en"> [UNDRIP] provides a framework for reconciliation, healing and peace, as well as harmonious and cooperative relations based on the principles of justice, democracy, respect for human rights, non-discrimination and good faith.... [They] constitute the minimum standards for the survival, dignity and well-being of Indigenous peoples of the world.... </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="6620818" data-originallang="en">It recognizes “historic injustices” and says that “the implementation of the Declaration must include concrete measures to address injustices, combat prejudice and eliminate all forms of violence and discrimination, including systemic discrimination, against Indigenous peoples.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="6620819" data-originallang="en">In substance, clause 5 states:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="6620820" data-originallang="en"> The Government of Canada must, in consultation and cooperation with Indigenous peoples, take all measures necessary to ensure that the laws of Canada are consistent with the Declaration. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="6620821" data-originallang="en"> Saganash rightly noted before committee that “the Minister of Justice [already] has an obligation under section 4.1 of the Department of Justice Act to make sure that any legislation, before it is introduced, is consistent with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms”, and he noted that Bill <a data-HoCid="11007812" href="/bills/43-2/C-15/" title="An Act respecting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">C-15</a> provides for an equivalent for indigenous rights and treaty rights in this country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6620822" data-originallang="en">Clause 6 is the most important section in this legislation:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="6620823" data-originallang="en"> The Minister must, in consultation and cooperation with Indigenous peoples and with other federal ministers, prepare and implement an action plan to achieve the objectives of the Declaration. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="6620824" data-originallang="en">This includes measures to “address injustices” and discrimination and to “promote mutual respect”; “measures related to monitoring, oversight, recourse or remedy” and accountability; and “measures related to monitoring the implementation of the plan” and annual reporting mechanisms to Parliament.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6620825" data-originallang="en">Bill <a data-HoCid="11007812" href="/bills/43-2/C-15/" title="An Act respecting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">C-15</a> does treat Bill <a data-HoCid="8160636" href="/bills/42-1/C-262/" title="An Act to ensure that the laws of Canada are in harmony with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">C-262</a> as a floor, which is incredibly important. It goes beyond, in its preamble, and recognizes the inherent right to self-determination, including a right to self-government.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6620826" data-originallang="en">In the words of the <a data-HoCid="245291" href="/politicians/david-lametti/" title="David Lametti">justice minister</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="6620827" data-originallang="en"> Bill C-15 would create a legislated, durable framework requiring government to work collaboratively with indigenous peoples to make steady progress in implementing the declaration across all areas of federal responsibility. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="6620828" data-originallang="en"> Is it supported by indigenous communities? Is it supported by experts? Is it supported by the above-noted Mr. Saganash? The answer is yes, an overwhelming yes. There is a letter in support of Bill <a data-HoCid="11007812" href="/bills/43-2/C-15/" title="An Act respecting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">C-15</a>, with over 200 signatures from first nations, from indigenous communities across the country, organizations, experts and activists, including Saganash, Irwin Cotler, the current NDP member for <a data-HoCid="253019" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>, and many others. I know that one of the signatories is also a constituent, Kerry Wilkins, who is an expert at the University of Toronto.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6620829" data-originallang="en">They write in this letter:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="6620830" data-originallang="en"> Parliament has an historic opportunity to advance reconciliation. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6620831" data-originallang="en"> [UNDRIP] is a consensus global human rights instrument, elaborating minimum standards for the “survival, dignity and well-being of Indigenous peoples.” Implementation of these standards is vital to improving the lives of Indigenous peoples in Canada and around the world, and to upholding Canada's solemn and urgent human rights commitments. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="6620832" data-originallang="en">They go on to note that the measures in Bill <a data-HoCid="11007812" href="/bills/43-2/C-15/" title="An Act respecting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">C-15</a> are “important, practical and achievable measures that deserve the support of all Canadians.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="6620833" data-originallang="en">Two of those signatories, Alex Neve, formerly of Amnesty International, and Brenda Gunn, wrote recently, and separately:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="6620834" data-originallang="en"> By any measure, implementing this global declaration domestically will significantly advance reconciliation and strengthen respect for the rights of Indigenous Peoples across the country. Not automatically. And not without much hard work ahead, such as the considerable effort—in full collaboration with First Nations, Inuit and Métis Peoples—that must be invested in developing the action plan for implementation that will be required. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="6620835" data-originallang="en">They go on to note that it is important as a matter of global leadership and that it “stands to advance Canada's overall commitment to international human rights.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="6620836" data-originallang="en">Speaking recently to a parliamentary committee studying Bill <a data-HoCid="11007812" href="/bills/43-2/C-15/" title="An Act respecting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">C-15</a>, Romeo Saganash stated:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="6620837" data-originallang="en"> I fully support Bill <a data-HoCid="11007812" href="/bills/43-2/C-15/" title="An Act respecting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">C-15</a> being tabled by the federal government in the House.... Government bills can proceed more efficiently, I believe, before the House and the Senate. Bill C-15 confirms the declaration as the minimum standards for the survival, dignity and well-being of indigenous peoples. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="6620838" data-originallang="en">He goes on to note that there are some amendments he would like to see, but he supports Bill <a data-HoCid="11007812" href="/bills/43-2/C-15/" title="An Act respecting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">C-15</a> and acknowledges that it meets his previous bill's commitment in Bill <a data-HoCid="8160636" href="/bills/42-1/C-262/" title="An Act to ensure that the laws of Canada are in harmony with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">C-262</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6620839" data-originallang="en">Former chair of the TRC and former senator Murray Sinclair said, “Indigenous people now will be able to negotiate with a stronger hand than they ever have in the past”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6620840" data-originallang="en"> The Assembly of First Nations said, “The AFN is urging all Parliamentarians to support adoption of a strong implementation framework before the close of this session of Parliament.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="6620841" data-originallang="en">The ITK calls for the strengthening of Bill <a data-HoCid="11007812" href="/bills/43-2/C-15/" title="An Act respecting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">C-15</a>, but goes on to say that it strongly encourages all members of Parliament to support Bill C-15 in order to help advance the urgent work of implementing UNDRIP.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6620842" data-originallang="en">The Métis National Council stated:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="6620843" data-originallang="en"> Canada now has the opportunity to assert its place as a world leader in the recognition of the human rights of Indigenous Peoples through this Bill. The Métis National Council fully supports this effort, and we urge members of all political parties to pass this legislation without delay. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="6620844" data-originallang="en"> Sheryl Lightfoot, the Canada research chair in global indigenous rights and politics at UBC, stated:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="6620845" data-originallang="en"> I am strongly in favour of the implementation model that Romeo Saganash created when he first brought...Bill C-262 before Parliament. This model, which is the foundation for Bill C-15, has a number of elements that I think are crucial. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6620846" data-originallang="en"> First of all, it requires collaboration with indigenous peoples. It also requires concrete action including legal reform and...the creation of an action plan, and it requires public reporting and accountabilities. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6620847" data-originallang="en"> ...Bill C-15 is advancing the global conversation and setting a very positive example.... </p>
<p data-HoCid="6620848" data-originallang="en"> Quite simply, Bill C-15 represents the best approach to human rights implementation that I have seen from around the world, bringing all of these various elements together. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="6620849" data-originallang="en">I previously noted my constituent Kerry Wilkins, who states, “Meaningful incorporation of UNDRIP into Canadian law would improve materially the circumstances, and enhance the autonomy, of Indigenous peoples dwelling here.” He goes on to provide a couple of examples. I recognize I am running out of time, so I will not get into them, unless perhaps I get asked questions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6620850" data-originallang="en">Of course, I expect the government will look for ways of improving the bill at committee. I hope to see further testimony at committee that addresses whether a three-year waiting period for the action plan is appropriate and, if it is, whether interim measures might be useful. I am also interested to understand from testimony why the bill does not include a section on power-sharing agreements in the same way B.C.'s UNDRIP implementation legislation does.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6620851" data-originallang="en">Finally, it is really important to emphasize that so much depends upon implementation, so there are big questions in that regard. This bill is important, but it is important in its potential. Let us pass it at second reading, send it to committee, improve it at committee where possible, and let us get back to the hard work of implementing this important international framework here at home.</p>
