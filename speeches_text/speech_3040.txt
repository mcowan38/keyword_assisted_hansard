<p data-HoCid="8025011" data-originallang="en">What I can say, Ms. Gazan, is it's an important question, but this is meant to be an incremental approach. We looked very closely at some of those other jurisdictions that I identified—New Zealand and Scotland, and then England, Wales and Northern Ireland combined—and the notion of having a broad and far-reaching mandate for the commission was made moot by some individuals who were helping us develop this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8025012" data-originallang="en"> What we tried to do was a have more targeted and focused initiative that looked at replacing my discretion with a commission of people who would be able to look at this using a slightly different test and outreach, which would allow for more applications to come in such that they would then be able to address the convictions we're seeing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8025013" data-originallang="en">As for what we do with the patterns we see, that is part of the parliamentary review that's built into the statute, so five years from now, this committee or another one will be looking at whether the legislation needs to be amended to perhaps examine exactly what you're speaking to.</p>
