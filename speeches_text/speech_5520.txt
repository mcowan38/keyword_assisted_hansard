<p data-HoCid="8732802" data-originallang="en"> I don't know the relevance of questioning the legitimacy of members, especially Jewish and Muslim members, to appear at a committee on topics of Islamophobia and anti-Semitism. It's truly disgusting. It's not relevant and it's disgusting to suggest that their presence delayed the study of this bill. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8732803" data-originallang="en">I'm hoping Mr. Van Popta can get to something relevant. I know he doesn't want Mr. Viersen to testify. Perhaps, as a compromise, we can meet this coming week after Remembrance Day, with Mr. Viersen starting the study. We could probably finish it next week. We could even call him this afternoon. I'm sure he'd be happy to Zoom in, and we'd be happy to hear from him. He's the first sponsor of a bill I've ever heard who didn't want to appear on his bill. </p>
