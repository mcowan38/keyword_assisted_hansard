<p data-HoCid="8010746" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, let me just start from the beginning. The minister has spoken loudly and clearly, denouncing all forms of hate. If he does not believe me, he should follow him on Twitter and he will see what I am talking about. Everyone in this country has the right to live their life free from fear of attack or abuse because of who they are as an individual.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8010747" data-originallang="en">I want to begin by condemning what we saw here on Parliament Hill this past weekend. The display of a swastika by an individual on Parliament Hill is unacceptable. We must always call out hateful imagery and this was appalling. Anti-Semitism is completely and utterly unacceptable.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8010748" data-originallang="en">Hatred that targets people based on race, faith, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, disability or any personal characteristic is counter to Canadian values. Everyone in Canada deserves a safe space to be themselves and to thrive. Unfortunately, hate, intolerance and racism, particularly anti-Semitism, exist in many ugly and dangerous forms throughout Canadian society and the world. Some are in plain sight, some are hidden.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8010749" data-originallang="en">I have no doubt that for many in the Jewish community this has undermined their faith in what Canada stands for as a country. Our government is working to ensure that this hate does not gain momentum in this country. We are working with groups like CIJA to address the challenges we face. I can assure the member that the <a data-HoCid="299999" href="/politicians/arif-virani/" title="Arif Virani">minister</a> and I, and the entire government, take this issue seriously and have plans to address anti-Semitism, lslamophobia and all forms of hate in this country. </p>
