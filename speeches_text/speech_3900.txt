<p data-HoCid="8303061" data-originallang="en">I have a box somewhere in my office—it's kind of messy, as you can see—of Soviet propaganda leaflets put out in the fifties, sixties, seventies and into the eighties. They're booklets cheaply printed and mass-produced on a whole variety of issues, but World War II is a big one. Many of them have sensational titles like “Nazi Werewolves of the SS” or whatever. All propaganda contains a mixture of facts, half-truths and out-and-out fabrications and lies. It's hard to sort anything out from them. Money has been invested in this process for decades by the Soviet government and now by the Russian government. It's something we have to deal with. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8303062" data-originallang="en">Again, it's not easy, because the nuances are complicated and the history is complicated. There is also moral ambiguity. Some Ukrainians point out that the allies signed an agreement with the Soviets to fight against the Germans. This was after they knew that Stalin was a mass murderer—after the Soviets and Nazis started the Second World War—but it was in our interest to do that. You can question the morality of it, or whatever, but it was done. Why is that okay and other things aren't?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303063" data-originallang="en">These are issues that need to be looked at in a serious way. I think we can move ahead in partnership with the communities that were affected—the Polish and Jewish communities, and other eastern European communities. There's the Roma community that also suffered terribly. I'm optimistic that, even through this process, things will turn the corner.</p>
