<p data-HoCid="8124560" data-originallang="en">I have a second question. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8124561" data-originallang="en">Canada's Middle East strategy has four priority areas: security and stabilization, humanitarian assistance, development and building resilience, and diplomatic engagement.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8124562" data-originallang="en">With regard to the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza, we are seeing all civilian infrastructure in the north being destroyed. We know that millions have been made homeless. We know that people are starving. Today we are seeing Israel flood tunnels with seawater, which will destroy infrastructure for decades to come. We are seeing orchards and farmers' fields being destroyed. We know that will impact food security for decades to come. We know that even though this conflict has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, which includes over 7,000 children, it is also destroying the infrastructure of the region. Therefore, reconstruction—when and if that happens—is likely to cost trillions of dollars.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8124563" data-originallang="en"> Who's going to pay for that reconstruction? Is Canada planning to increase its funding for this, given its role in allowing this violence to continue? What kind of financial responsibility will Canada be taking for the reconstruction of Gaza when this war is over?</p>
