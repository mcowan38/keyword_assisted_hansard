<p data-HoCid="8406182" data-originallang="en">Again, “Last night, the resistance in Gaza led a heroic attack against the occupation and has taken over 30 hostages.” I don't even need to read it because I remember it. It was on October 8 by SPHR Concordia. SPHR Concordia is still a club, and the students are still students with no consequences.</p>
