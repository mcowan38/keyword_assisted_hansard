<p data-HoCid="8455934" data-originallang="en"> We apply our student code with respect to discrimination, hate, bullying, harassment or any other offensive behaviour that is targeted at specific groups based on their race, religion, background or circumstance, etc. It's much like how my colleague at the University of Toronto described it. Our policies fully cover all forms of hate against all communities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455935" data-originallang="en"> Lately, as anti-Semitism has become much more obvious and explicit in our society, including on our campuses, we have been calling it out specifically. We will certainly look, going forward, at whether any changes are needed and where we need to explicitly enshrine any particular groups within our EDI policies or discrimination policies.</p>
