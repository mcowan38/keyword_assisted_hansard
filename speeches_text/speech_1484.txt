<p data-HoCid="6975619" data-originallang="en">Thank you. That was actually my next question, because I think the legal opinion is pretty clear. With the greatest respect to Mr. Dion, his interpretation is incorrect, and the benefits of this program far outweigh any risk of undue influence with respect to members of Parliament. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6975620" data-originallang="en">I'm not on this committee. I was asked to sub in five minutes before it started, so I'm learning as quickly as I can. I want to suggest that the committee consider taking up Mr. Fogel's suggestion to have a specific stream for sponsor interns. I think we could right this ship and start seeing the benefits of this program again.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6975621" data-originallang="en">CIJA interns are not just in the Jewish community. They're from the community at large. I know many people in my own community, not just in the Jewish community, have fabulous careers in politics and law and many other things. The benefits of this program need to be reinstated and protected as we go forward.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6975622" data-originallang="en">That's just a comment, Madam Chair. I don't have a further question. Thank you.</p>
