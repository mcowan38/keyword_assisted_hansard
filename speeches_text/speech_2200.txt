<p data-HoCid="7649806" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I would like to ask the member opposite a two-part question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7649807" data-originallang="en">He was in the House when the member for <a data-HoCid="278226" href="/politicians/john-nater/" title="John Nater">Perthâ€”Wellington</a> was speaking and said foreign interference to even one Canadian is unacceptable. Does the member opposite agree with that?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7649808" data-originallang="en">His caucus members met with an alt-right MP, Christine Anderson, from a foreign government. She came to this country spouting anti-Islamic rhetoric, denying the Holocaust and glorifying Nazis. If the member actually does not support even one Canadian being influenced by foreign interference, will he and his party ask that those three members be removed from their caucus?</p>
