<p data-HoCid="8303154" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much for the question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303155" data-originallang="en">My late wife was of Jewish Polish origin. A few years ago, I got a call from the Polish embassy. They wanted to award me the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland for work I did regarding the maintenance of the Auschwitz camp so that it stays as a monument to man's inhumanity to man. I asked my wife, “Should I accept it?” She said, “Absolutely”, because that is one step towards reconciliation. “Do this and continue the work of reconciliation with the Polish community and Poland.” Then I did it. Those little gestures, I think, matter.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303156" data-originallang="en">In Canada, I would say the relationship between the Ukrainian and Jewish communities, despite the troubled past, is actually quite good. Both the Ukrainian and Jewish communities are facing crises now. I'll make this very short. I can tell you that, when Russia started its war, the Jewish community mobilized to help welcome refugees from Ukraine, and we're grateful for the support the community has given to the Jewish community now. I think this is the kind of work we should build on.</p>
