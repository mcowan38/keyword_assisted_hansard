<p data-HoCid="8726939" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> dances while Montreal burns. Over the weekend, Montreal was attacked by a vicious anti-Semitic mob. It attacked police, lit vehicles on fire and bashed in windows while the Prime Minister was busy dancing at a Taylor Swift concert. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8726940" data-originallang="en">This is what we get from a <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> who, for nine years, has divided Canadians. He divided us by race, religion, region, age and wealth. He has opened our borders to criminals and terrorists who attack law-abiding Canadian citizens. What is the result? It is firebombings of synagogues, extremists attacking mandirs and gurdwaras, over 100 churches burned and vandalized, and hate crime up 251%. When it comes to fighting anti-Semitism, Second Cup has more chutzpah than this weak Prime Minister. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8726941" data-originallang="en">Canadians need an election now so that Conservatives can restore our values, our freedoms, and law and order in this country.</p>
