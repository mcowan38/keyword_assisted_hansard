<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join the debate on a Bloc opposition day motion. To summarize it briefly, it would recall a vote in the House that tied immigration targets in Canada to various areas of capacity in social services, French and English-language training, transportation infrastructure, health care, jobs availability and education. This was voted on at the end of last year, typically when the permanent residents plan is tabled in Parliament, but also the temporary residents plan of the government. A three-year rolling plan is put forward. This motion refers to it and tells the government to do its homework once again, in light of a lot of new announcements that have been made.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">This debate involves the <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">Minister of Immigration</a>. My experience on the immigration committee is that often invectives are hurled toward members who simply have questions, concerns and comments. A few members of the Bloc have already said that whenever they expressed a concern about the integration capacity in Quebec, especially on the island of Montreal where there is a lack of capacity, for example, for French-language training, they were quickly called names and insulted by the Minister of Immigration outside of the House quite often. It happened again yesterday at committee and on the minister's Twitter account.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">The Conservatives have that same experience very often from Liberal members of Parliament. If the Liberals do not have an argument, they move on to insults. Margaret Thatcher loved to say that quite commonly.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Today, I will outline what I think is a common-sense Conservative proposal to what we should take into account when redoing the targets. A lot of it comes directly from government sources. We see it in government talking points and what different ministers have said. We have the bizarre situation today of there being a junior and senior minister of immigration. The new <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">Minister of Immigration</a> says that the system is out of control, by his own admission. He has said it several times. He was quoted as saying it in the National Post. He said it on CTV's <em>Question Period</em>. He also said, “That volume is really disconcerting. It's really a system that has gotten out of control.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">In an article by journalist Ryan Tumilty, the headline was, “'Out of control': Immigration minister says he wants to reduce international student arrivals”. It goes on to say, “The increase is considered one of many factors leading to housing shortages and rent hikes across the country.” That is the tie-in to housing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Then there is the senior minister of immigration, who is now the <a data-HoCid="300008" href="/politicians/sean-fraser/" title="Sean Fraser">Minister of Housing</a>, and he has a lot of regrets, because for two and a half years he essentially let the system get out of control. That is what the <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">Minister of Immigration</a> is saying today about his predecessor's work. It is not Conservatives, Bloc MPs or New Democrats saying it. Over the last three months, two ministers have been fighting it out in public about whose fault it is that the system became out of control.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">The <a data-HoCid="300008" href="/politicians/sean-fraser/" title="Sean Fraser">Minister of Housing</a> now, the senior minister of immigration, went even further. In a different article by Touria Izri for <em>Global News</em>, the housing minister was quoted as saying, “temporary immigration programs are putting pressure on the housing system and creating a 'serious issue we need to address.'” Why did he not address it when he was the immigration minister? Why has he only discovered this now?</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">In fact, the journalists refer to a briefing note that was given to the minister, the new <a data-HoCid="300008" href="/politicians/sean-fraser/" title="Sean Fraser">Minister of Housing</a>, the senior minister for immigration, that warned him that the targets the Government of Canada was setting, especially on what it was doing with temporary resident permits for international students, foreign work permits for the temporary foreign worker program and the international mobility program, were going to lead to pressures in rental housing. People were going to have a tough time affording housing, either purchasing or renting a home. </p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">The Bank of Canada said that 60% of newcomers would rent, especially for the first 10 years. I know this for a fact as I was a newcomer. When my father came here in 1983, he rented. When the rest of the family came here in 1985, we rented for many years on the south shore of Montreal. I am very well aware of the newcomer experience. When newcomers first come to Canada, they rent, and rents across the country are going up.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">In the last nine years, rents have doubled. Down payments have more than doubled. The price of homes is out of control, and that is not the fault of immigrants or newcomers. That is the fault of the government for vastly overspending during the pandemic, $600 billion of pandemic spending, $205 billion of which had nothing to do with the response to the pandemic. </p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">When a lot of cash is chasing fewer goods, it leads to higher prices. When a briefing note is provided to the minister by his own immigration department that tells the minister about concerns of continuing to allow a lot of newcomers to come to Canada, well over a million last year and I think it will be a million before the same deadline this year, as well as over a million in the next six months, then we have a system that is out of control. I am referencing the junior immigration minister. The system is a mess. I am quoting the senior immigration <a data-HoCid="300008" href="/politicians/sean-fraser/" title="Sean Fraser">minister</a>, who is titled as the housing <a data-HoCid="300008" href="/politicians/sean-fraser/" title="Sean Fraser">minister</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Of course they have regrets. They are going on different podcasts, complaining about each other's work and drawing attention to whose fault it is. It is the fault of the Liberals. They have been in government for nine years. They bear responsibility for the chaos on our streets today, with crime that is out of control. They are responsible. If we are renewing our leases this year and we see a 20% or 30% increase to them, we have only three people to blame: the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, his housing <a data-HoCid="300008" href="/politicians/sean-fraser/" title="Sean Fraser">minister</a> and his immigration <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">minister</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Every other minister on the front bench bears cabinet responsibility for the decisions they make. The Conservatives are not making this argument; I am using their own words. They have been in the news. At the end of November, Mia Rabson from the Canadian Press quoted the senior immigration minister, who is now moonlighting as a housing minister.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">The current <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">minister</a> said of the student visa system, “It’s a bit of a mess...It’s time to rein it in.” He then went on to talk about Uber drivers. On the international student program, he was making comparisons, saying some of these colleges were behaving like puppy mills. What kind of bizarre commentary is that, to try to insult international students who are here?</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">I was an international student at one point in the United States and I do not remember being insulted in such a way. If, in fact, for the last two and a half years there were these private colleges and others, which the minister is now accusing of being puppy mills, it was the department that was issuing visas for them. Why were they doing that? They were warned.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">A briefing note was circulating somewhere. Some journalists have it, but I do not. I was actually asked by a journalist from the Toronto Star whether I had it. It is the one that ties temporary immigration numbers to the potential for housing crisis. That is not me saying it; that is the department. The immigration department was warning the previous <a data-HoCid="300008" href="/politicians/sean-fraser/" title="Sean Fraser">minister</a>, the now housing <a data-HoCid="300008" href="/politicians/sean-fraser/" title="Sean Fraser">minister</a>, that this might happen. The articles go on and on.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">We have these two ministers who are having a public debate, an argument. I am sure that it started some time in cabinet. There is a Yiddish proverb I am reminded of, because I love Yiddish proverbs, as many members know. My grandmother used to say them in Polish, but Yiddish used to be a common language and culture to eastern Europe. The proverb is that when a fool and a wise man are debating, there are only two fools debating. Sometimes it feels that way when I am watching the debate in public, because—</p>
