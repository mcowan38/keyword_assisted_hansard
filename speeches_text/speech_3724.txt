<p data-HoCid="8247164" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, constituents have reached out to me to raise the plight of their loved ones in Gaza and the heart-wrenching humanitarian crisis unfolding there. They have asked me to advocate on their behalf for the immediate provision of aid, including food, clean water, medication and medical supplies. They are pleading for Canada to use all our influence to support the passage of aid into Gaza for civilians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8247165" data-originallang="en">This is about our humanity. Canadians are rightly proud of our peacekeeping tradition, and I, like many, am disturbed by what we are seeing on the ground. Gazans need humanitarian aid, and that requires allowing the unobstructed delivery of the essentials for life. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8247166" data-originallang="en">Canada has provided $100 million in aid, but we have to ensure our support and the support that others have stepped up to provide can actually make it to those who are suffering. We cannot fail, and lasting peace is the only solution.</p>
