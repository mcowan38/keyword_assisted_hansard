<p data-HoCid="7927982" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, all members of the House expect the government and the Prime Minister's Office to do some research when it comes to guests here in Parliament. Now that it has welcomed an individual who was a member of a Nazi unit responsible for murdering thousands of Jews, our trust is forever shaken. What a disgrace to not only welcome such an individual, but to praise him. Ignorance is a war crime. All Canadians have being humiliated.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7927983" data-originallang="fr">Will the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> apologize to his fellow parliamentarians, Canadians, the international community and, in particular, Jewish Canadians?</p>
