<p data-HoCid="8692037" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Madam Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8692038" data-originallang="en">The motion before us is to extend by 30 days the study on Bill <a data-HoCid="11714011" href="/bills/44-1/C-270/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (pornographic material)"> C-270</a>, the stopping internet sexual exploitation act. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8692039" data-originallang="en">I have to ask myself why we need that extension. This bill has been with us since May 8. Madam Chair, I think that's the date you said earlier in today's discussion. Now it's October 31. What has taken so long? </p>
<p data-HoCid="8692040" data-originallang="en">Mr. Brock said earlier that we've been ready for weeks to go ahead with the commencement of the study of this very important legislation. I think it was at a meeting probably two weeks ago that it was.... It must have been a Thursday, because it was suggested that perhaps we could have witnesses at our committee meeting on Monday, just a few days later. I believe that the clerk was absolutely accurate when he said that didn't give us enough time to get headsets out to the witnesses. Some of them were going to come in by video conference, and that would take a bit more time. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8692041" data-originallang="en">I'm just an ordinary member of this committee, so I wasn't part of the organizing of events and the schedule for this fall session, but I had expected that those witnesses would be here on the Thursday. That would have given us enough time to get whatever materials out to them and to get them prepared. Instead, what were we doing on that Thursday? We were writing the anti-Semitism report. This was all done in camera so I need to be careful about what I say about those two studies, but we were studying anti-Semitism, and we were studying Islamophobia. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8692042" data-originallang="en">That goes back to the spring of this year, when a motion was put forward that this committee should study anti-Semitism and its rise in Canada, particularly at Canadian universities. I agree that's a very important study. We all agreed with that, and we wanted to move forward. Then it became complicated when there was another motion put forward to also study Islamophobia, which was also a very important study. We suggested that maybe that could be put off for a later time, but it was decided that we were going to study those two issues at the same time, not as one study, but as two separate studies. That was all on the public record, so I can say that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8692043" data-originallang="en">We had witnesses come in on those two studies, again all on the public record. I'm very impressed with the courage of the witnesses who came forward and spoke very openly about the issues that were facing them, whether it was on the Islamophobia study or on the anti-Semitism study. They came here and gave testimony. It was very heartfelt. We all realized that these are issues that are front and centre for Canada, and that we need to deal with them. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8692044" data-originallang="en">Over the summer months.... I think we had six meetings over six days, three on anti-Semitism and three on Islamophobia. We heard from many witnesses, and then over the summer months the analysts spent some time preparing the draft reports. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8692045" data-originallang="en">We came back in September, and these reports are in front of us. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8692046" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, until now, we are still drafting those reports. I can't believe how long it is taking to do that. Part of the problem is that on the Liberal side of this committee, it's a different bench depending on whether it's the Islamophobia study or the anti-Semitism study. It is clear to us on this side of the table that those two groups are not talking with each other and that there's conflict in the Liberal caucus about these two very important issues. That's what's been dragging things on and on. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8692047" data-originallang="en">Again, I need to be careful about what I say, because this is all being done in camera. We on this side of the table are trying our best to produce these two reports, so that they can be made public and we can talk about them publicly. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8692048" data-originallang="en">I had expected that was what we were going to be doing today. We were so close on the anti-Semitism report. I think with just a little more discussion, we're going to get them done. That's why I supported the dilatory motion of my colleague, Mr. Brock, to go forward with finalizing that study, and believed that the next day we could go ahead and finalize the Islamophobia study. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8692049" data-originallang="en"> Now things are just dragging on and on, not through any fault of ours on this side of the table. We've been doing our best to move these two issues forward.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8692050" data-originallang="en"> I think it would be very useful to this committee and to this Parliament if the members of the Liberal Party would talk with each other about these two important issues and resolve the conflicts amongst themselves so that we can go on and get these two studies finished.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8692051" data-originallang="en">I am prepared to go ahead with studying Bill <a data-HoCid="11714011" href="/bills/44-1/C-270/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (pornographic material)">C-270</a>. I've read some of the major speeches that were given in the House at second reading. I'm not really familiar with these issues, and that's why I'm very anxious to delve into the study. However, when reading those speeches, I read about some of the very heartfelt testimony that has been given by witnesses who are victims of pornography. These are usually young girls who are being victimized by owners of porn sites, who are making a lot of money from these poor victims. I think that we need to get on with that study, and I think it is such a shame that the Liberal members of this committee are trying to politicize it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8692052" data-originallang="en">I, too, would love to hear from <a data-HoCid="278476" href="/politicians/arnold-viersen/" title="Arnold Viersen">Mr. Viersen</a>, to hear what he has to say. However, when I read these tweets from Mr. Maloney, I can't blame Mr. Viersen for being reluctant to come here. He wants to come here to give testimony about the issues that are important. He wants to talk about the matters of Bill <a data-HoCid="11714011" href="/bills/44-1/C-270/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (pornographic material)">C-270</a>, and it is clear that the Liberal members of the House want to talk about something else when he is here. I think that is just unacceptable.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8692053" data-originallang="en"> Madam Chair, I think that it is time to move forward on all three of these studies. Let's get the anti-Semitism study done. I think we still have time today. If the Liberals would reconsider the motion of my colleague, Mr. Brock, to go ahead and finish that study, we can then go into an in camera session, and we can finish off that study.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8692054" data-originallang="en">Let's proceed with the other witnesses on Bill <a data-HoCid="11714011" href="/bills/44-1/C-270/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (pornographic material)">C-270</a>. Let's move forward with that, regardless of whether or not <a data-HoCid="278476" href="/politicians/arnold-viersen/" title="Arnold Viersen">Mr. Viersen</a> is going to come here. There are a lot of good witnesses we should hear from. I think it would be best if Mr. Viersen were here, but it's not necessary. We can proceed without him, and I think that's exactly what we should do.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8692055" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
