<p data-HoCid="6403412" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Chair, I had a series of questions, but Mr. Morantz's comments really resonated with me.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6403413" data-originallang="fr">I think bad faith must really be involved for someone to claim that Canada took an anti-Israel position.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6403414" data-originallang="fr">All of us here are used to having bills presented to us. There used to even be mammoth bills with a number of provisions, some of which we may agree with and others we may not. That even happened under Stephen Harper's Conservative government. In the end, a decision had to be made that could be interpreted by some as the position on all the elements of the bill. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6403415" data-originallang="fr">We are also used to certain Conservative Party motions that include the kitchen sink. They contain many things, some of which we agree with, and some of which we disagree with, but, at the end of the day, we have to vote either for or against the motion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6403416" data-originallang="fr">I see that Canada has voted in favour of the two-state solution, which is the solution that will help achieve a sustainable peace to benefit both the Palestinians and the Israelis.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6403417" data-originallang="fr">Of course, there may be disagreements over fact that the motion was referring to a contiguous territory. In an ideal world, we may wish for the two territories to be contiguous, but the geographic reality makes this not the case.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6403418" data-originallang="fr">I think that Ambassador Rae was very clear when he appeared before this committee. He told us that, when he expressed reservations about the resolution, he did so on behalf of the Government of Canada. The reservations were not expressed only by Bob Rae as a citizen or even as an ambassador, but by the Government of Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6403419" data-originallang="fr">As for the fact that Israel is occupying that land illegally, that is indeed the case. The international community has been refusing to recognize that since 1967. We can bury our heads in the sand and pretend that Israel is not an occupying state, but Israel has been occupying land that does not belong to it. The international community does not recognize this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6403420" data-originallang="fr">The United States went a bit outside the mainstream by moving its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but the entire international community is keeping its diplomatic missions in Tel Aviv to indicate that the Jerusalem question has not yet been resolved. As long as no two-state solution has been reached, no sustainable peace that will benefit all parties can be established.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6403421" data-originallang="fr">Minister, on the contrary, I want to express my support for your decision because I don't think that decision was against Israel. There were elements in the resolution that we may disagree with, and I think you have been clear on those elements. However, I think it was, on the contrary, a responsible position in favour of peace, both for Palestine and Israel.</p>
