<p data-HoCid="8576906" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, the Conservative Party of Canada absolutely supports international law. That is why we reject, denounce and condemn Iran, the terrorist genocide regime in Tehran, sending missiles at innocent civilians in Israel. Hamas murdering thousands of Jews sounds like a pretty big violation of international law to me. I reject that. I absolutely reject all of that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8576907" data-originallang="en">We need international law to enforce things like UN Security Resolution 1701, which the UN has clearly failed to do. The UN has failed to enforce any law that would protect the right of Israel to exist. What the member opposite has consistently failed to do is start her questions by saying she supports the right of Israel to exist and rejects the regime in Iran, all its terrorist proxies and the terrorist activities they have subjected Jews and the entire Middle Eastern region to for years, and Canadians, Americans and countless others they have blown up in terrorist attacks that are direct violations of international law.</p>
