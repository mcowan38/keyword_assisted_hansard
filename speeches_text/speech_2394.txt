<p data-HoCid="7852191" data-originallang="en">In January of 2022, the Minister of National Defence's advisory panel on systemic racism and discrimination released its final report. In it they made four recommendations. A quick glance, though, at annex E—you may be familiar with it—of the report appears to show that the panel, comprised of four individuals, only met with two different organizations with a religious focus, that of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs and the Royal Canadian Chaplain Service.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7852192" data-originallang="en">Do you believe the panel did their due diligence when taking a look at the question of reforming the CAF chaplaincy? </p>
