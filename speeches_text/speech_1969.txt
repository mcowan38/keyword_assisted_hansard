<p data-HoCid="7414792" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Madam Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7414793" data-originallang="en">I want to start with Dr. Singer. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7414794" data-originallang="en">I had the pleasure of being in Congress. We did hearings for our interparliamentary task force on online anti-Semitism. We got to have hearings where we had Meta, Google, TikTok and Twitter.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7414795" data-originallang="en">I had a chance to talk to a lot of legislators, at least at the House level, and I found real consensus amongst Democrats and Republicans on both sides, whether it related to section 230 or to monopoly of the platforms, that there needed to be more done to deal with the practices and techniques of these tech giants. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7414796" data-originallang="en">I know that the House of Representatives antitrust subcommittee recently accused platforms like Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook of abusing their monopoly power.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7414797" data-originallang="en">How do these tech giants consolidate their market power? What practices and techniques are they using that prompt all these concerns?</p>
