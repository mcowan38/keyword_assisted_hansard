<p data-HoCid="7377005" data-originallang="en">I think the disaggregated data, which you mentioned, is one of the most important things. We just don't have information on a federal level about where the need is for trans and gender-diverse communities. For example, the 2019 health standing committee report on LGBTQIA2 health has data specifically on the experiences of LGB people, but there are no axes of analysis about how that breaks out when compared to gender identity. While you're right, Ms. Gazan, that research has been done on provincial levels, we haven't had that data on a federal level yet.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7377006" data-originallang="en">The training for service providers is another big piece, and building on what some of other witnesses have said, I think funding is a really big part of it. Most of the organizations across the country that provide services to LGBTQIA+ people are funded on a project basis, so there's no ability to grow that kind of core capacity.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7377007" data-originallang="en">When you're thinking about marginalized communities, the clinical support is a really important aspect. The other piece is being able to connect with people who share your experience. When you think about pride centres or queer and trans community centres, they're really providing life-saving support. I think, especially in rural areas or more remote areas or in provinces that don't have big cities and that have municipally funded pride centres, that funding is a really core need.</p>
