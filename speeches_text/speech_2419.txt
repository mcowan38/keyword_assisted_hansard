<p data-HoCid="7859560" data-originallang="en">Thank you for the question, Mr. Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7859561" data-originallang="en">Swimming Canada is constantly looking at our procedures with regard to international travel. We have several teams travelling this summer to Fukuoka, Japan, as well as to Israel later in the summerâ€”a junior team. Our para team will be in Great Britain. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7859562" data-originallang="en">We're constantly forward looking to those sites and how we create procedures that will protect the swimmers in that environment. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7859563" data-originallang="en">As an example, with the competition coming up in Israel and the uncertainty of the climate and the travel, we're in constant contact with World Aquatics and looking for their safety plans, their plans that are in place for the sport to compete there and to compete there safely. </p>
