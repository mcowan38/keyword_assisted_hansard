<p data-HoCid="8703336" data-originallang="en">As I mentioned in my presentation, Canada has demonstrated to Israel that there are no consequences for maintaining the status quo. For Israel, the status quo is completely acceptable, but for Palestinians, it means that everybody is stateless, without rights, dispossessed and subject to horrifying violence. It's not acceptable. Either they have a state or they have equal rights within a democratic state. It's one or the other. The current status quo is not an option.</p>
