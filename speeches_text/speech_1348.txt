<p data-HoCid="6914997" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask my colleague from Edmonton Strathcona the same question I asked the member for <a data-HoCid="278717" href="/politicians/mike-morrice/" title="Mike Morrice">Kitchener Centre</a> earlier.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6914998" data-originallang="fr">The Bloc Québécois agrees with the NDP and the Green Party that underused housing should be taxed. What rubs us the wrong way, though, is the federal government grabbing a piece of the property tax pie, the one remaining area of jurisdiction it has not yet encroached on. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6914999" data-originallang="fr">I think it would be more appropriate for the federal government to work with municipalities, because they should be the ones collecting this tax and using it for their infrastructure. They could even target more people than Bill <a data-HoCid="11496808" href="/bills/44-1/C-8/">C‑8</a>, which currently sets out a lot of exceptions. What are my colleague's thoughts on that? </p>
