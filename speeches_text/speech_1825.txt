<p data-HoCid="7345394" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair and members of the committee, good afternoon. Thank you for your invitation to appear today and for this opportunity to discuss the funding granted—and subsequently terminated—to the Community Media Advocacy Centre.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345395" data-originallang="en"> I am joined today by Mala Khanna, associate deputy minister, Canadian Heritage.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345396" data-originallang="fr">I want to begin by reiterating that anti-Semitism and hatred in all its forms have no place in Canada. Our government is firmly committed to fighting racism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345397" data-originallang="en">In 2019 when our government created Canada's first ever anti-racism strategy, we did so with a clear direction to support community organizations across Canada, addressing the issues of anti-racism and multiculturalism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345398" data-originallang="en">Through the anti-racism action program, funding was intended to empower communities on the ground and to help address all forms of racism and discrimination.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345399" data-originallang="en">When it comes to the selection process, we expect funded organizations to uphold the core values championed through the anti-racism strategy. That, of course, wasn't the case with one of the organizations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345400" data-originallang="en">The anti-Semitic, hateful and xenophobic comments made by Laith Marouf are vile and reprehensible. I have said this before and I'll say it again: I condemn them in the strongest possible terms.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345401" data-originallang="en">The fact that the Community Media Advocacy Centre received federal funding while employing Mr. Marouf is unacceptable and should, quite frankly, never have happened. The contract with CMAC has since been terminated, and we have sought to recover all payments made to the organization.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345402" data-originallang="en">It is clear that the vetting process failed. This individual slipped through the cracks during the review of the CMAC application. The incident reflects a failure in the system and is a slap in the face to the Jewish community, the francophone community and many other groups that he has continuously attacked with his hateful comments, and for that, I sincerely apologize.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345403" data-originallang="en">We are determined to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again, so today I am grateful for the opportunity to be here to speak with you about the immediate actions we have taken and the work we are continuing to do to strengthen how we assess and vet projects.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345404" data-originallang="fr">I have asked Canadian Heritage to undertake a comprehensive review of the assessment of applications and to introduce enhanced training on application verification for all program officers.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345405" data-originallang="en"> This will include enhanced diversity and inclusion training for all program officers, including anti-racism and anti-Semitism awareness training.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345406" data-originallang="en">I've also asked officials to introduce conditions in all of our funding agreements that will allow the federal government to take immediate action should any organization or individual be identified as having promoted or shared hate, racism, anti-Semitism or discrimination in any form.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345407" data-originallang="en">This will help us to ensure that, moving forward, we can move quickly and decisively as soon as we are made aware. All organizations and individuals that see their funding cut in this manner will also never be eligible for future funding. These are important measures and will help us prevent hateful groups or individuals from slipping through the cracks.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345408" data-originallang="en">These have been informed by working closely with Jewish community organizations and community leaders and groups, such as the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs and B'nai Brith, as well as members of Parliament. We thank them for their advocacy in ensuring that all voices were reflected in our efforts because, as we know, racism, hate and anti-Semitism remain a reality in Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345409" data-originallang="en">This is why our government has been steadfast in our commitments to fight racism and anti-Semitism at every turn. From the appointment of the Honourable Irwin Cotler as Canada's Special Envoy on Preserving Holocaust Remembrance and Combatting Antisemitism to holding Canada's first-ever National Summit on Antisemitism, we've been working closely with the Jewish community to ensure that their voices are heard and reflected in our actions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345410" data-originallang="en">Through this year's budget alone, we're committing important supports for the construction of the new Holocaust museum, as well as for the Sarah and Chaim Neuberger Holocaust education centre.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345411" data-originallang="en">We are now going to renew and reform our anti-racism strategy, which will be informed by our conversations with members of all communities—</p>
