<p data-HoCid="6553581" data-originallang="fr">Madam Speaker, we have had three bills introduced in the same session on achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, which I think sends a powerful message about how we need to do what is necessary to reach that goal.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6553582" data-originallang="fr">The time has come to take decisive action to combat climate change. Canada needs climate change legislation that is rooted in the principles of good governance, guided by transparency, accountability, equity and, most importantly, science.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6553583" data-originallang="fr">I commend and thank the member for <a data-HoCid="253019" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> for this bill. I also appreciate the references to indigenous nations and the consideration given to indigenous knowledge. For example, we can learn a lot from New Zealand's experience of considering indigenous knowledge and incorporating the Maori people's good governance of the ocean into its policies. Government stakeholders worked in conjunction with Maori organizations and partners to develop the seven principles for ecosystem-based management for this shared governance.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6553584" data-originallang="fr">I will now get back to Canada and the importance of protecting biodiversity in our fight against climate change. I cannot resist saying a few words about the large number of programs for indigenous peoples that involve promoting and developing projects that pollute and harm the environment instead of focusing on forward-looking and innovative plans for the future.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6553585" data-originallang="fr">Relations between the Crown and Canada's first nations are a topical issue. Reconciliation is a profound and vital act. In order to achieve it, we must listen to first nations' environmental concerns and welcome their contributions. Nothing productive will come of always portraying their environmental concerns as those of opponents.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6553586" data-originallang="fr">We recognize that indigenous peoples' knowledge of the land is extremely relevant in managing ecosystems and protecting biodiversity. In that regard, we must not just integrate the indigenous fact into a climate law for aesthetic reasons in order to ease our conscience. The intention must be firm and sincere. Experts have done a great deal of work, but unfortunately it has not translated into political action or legal commitments. The government could start by providing access to safe drinking water.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6553587" data-originallang="fr">That being said, the Bloc Québécois agrees with the principles and objectives set out in Bill <a data-HoCid="10866248" href="/bills/43-2/C-232/" title="An Act respecting a Climate Emergency Action Framework">C-232</a>. Just today, March 11, 2021, Quebec began honouring the victims of COVID-19, but let us look at what has happened over the past year.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6553588" data-originallang="fr">Unfortunately, over the past year, the government has done a lot to help the fossil fuel industry, rather than to fight climate change.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6553589" data-originallang="fr"> According to the International Institute for Sustainable Development's 2020 report, subsidies for fossil fuels neared $5 billion. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6553590" data-originallang="fr">The government made promises during the election campaign and once it was in power, but it has not acted on those promises. Whatever happened to the modernization of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act? What about the two billion trees that are supposed to be planted? What have they done to intensify climate action? What is their plan to end government support for the fossil fuel sector?</p>
<p data-HoCid="6553591" data-originallang="fr">The Bloc Québécois has always taken a strong stance on environmental protection and the fight against climate change and what must be done to reverse Canada's unfortunate trajectory. Why not show the people that their elected representatives are committed to fighting climate change by being honest about the facts and pragmatic about the solutions available to us? Does Canada not want to preserve what is left of its international reputation for its efforts to fight climate change?</p>
<p data-HoCid="6553592" data-originallang="fr">Every economy around the world is struggling, and everything has been disrupted, but many countries are responding with determination and resilience. The Canadian government should pay close attention to countries that are making progress.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6553593" data-originallang="fr">It will certainly be crucial for the current and future governments not to drag their feet. In the challenge we are facing, maintaining the status quo would actually be a step backwards. What we really need is to leap ahead.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6553594" data-originallang="fr">That is why bills introduced by the opposition parties must be taken into consideration. In that sense, Bill <a data-HoCid="10866248" href="/bills/43-2/C-232/" title="An Act respecting a Climate Emergency Action Framework">C-232</a>, much like its companion legislation, Bill <a data-HoCid="10866095" href="/bills/43-2/C-215/" title="An Act respecting Canada’s fulfillment of its greenhouse gas emissions reduction obligations">C-215</a> introduced by the Bloc Québécois, would benefit just as much from being improved if it is to be considered a legislative framework. Bill C-232 falls somewhere in between, since it is neither an action plan nor a proposed legislative framework. It is a halfway point and needs to be completed. I say that as a point of constructive feedback.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6553595" data-originallang="fr">Here are some examples of the clarifications needed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6553596" data-originallang="fr"> Clause 4 states that the minister must develop an action framework in consultation with indigenous peoples and civil society. Providing for that kind of consultation is appropriate, but the details of that need to be specified. Public consultation should be supplementary to the consideration of expert opinions. It should include elements that are ultimately incorporated into framework climate legislation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6553597" data-originallang="fr">Dedicating a section to targets is good. The strength of the bill is that it includes the target, specifies it and clearly states that meeting the target is mandatory. It should also clearly outline the policies it proposes, and they must correspond to the area of federal jurisdiction and not that of the provinces. Environmental policy is largely the responsibility of the provincial governments, and successfully fighting climate change depends in large part on the policies of and actions taken by Quebec and the provinces.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6553598" data-originallang="fr">Measures for transitioning to a green economy also need to be incorporated. The Bloc Québécois's green and fair recovery plan can be used as a model. I want to be positive and give members something to think about by raising the experience of the United Kingdom, which is garnering a lot of attention, and rightly so. The success of its climate legislation is measurable, and the outcomes have been analyzed. I want to share with my colleagues some important observations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6553599" data-originallang="fr">The success of the United Kingdom's climate change act has been attributed to several factors. However, experts have emphasized the benefits of including the action plan within the text of the legislation. Why? Because doing so lends legitimacy to the act, makes it easier to understand and increases the support of civil society, economic and social stakeholders, and political actors at all levels. That is what ensures long-term stability. The legislation thus becomes permanent and there is less risk of backtracking at the whim of successive governments. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6553600" data-originallang="fr">To critics of such an approach who may fear that it would weaken the legislator's prerogatives, I will point out that it is possible to strike a balance between policy directions and the different levels of precision or flexibility of a plan. The United Kingdom has done it, and has even inspired other states to try to do the same.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6553601" data-originallang="fr">A recent poll was done of people, mostly elected officials, who were involved in the legislative process. They acknowledged that the U.K. climate change committee owed its success to its independence. They noted that having directions and recommendations from a pool of experts on every legislative aspect contributed to a political consensus. Why? Because the work was done by independent voices and that makes it credible. The elected members found that what had been communicated allowed them to better understand the issues and come up with better solutions. They added that once impartiality was established and in the absence of political or other interests, collaboration and consensus followed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6553602" data-originallang="fr">The United Kingdom has seen its greenhouse gas emissions drop by 28% since 2010, while securing economic growth of nearly 19%. During the same period, Canada had similar results in economic growth, but saw its emissions increase by 3%.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6553603" data-originallang="fr">Several observations can be made to show that Canada's climate governance is not working. A healthy climate governance, one that works and is proven to meet targets, requires projects to be assessed annually. Second, the government needs to be required to table a response to the annual report. Third, the interim objectives have to be set long in advance. Finally, the recommendations have to be evidence-based.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6553604" data-originallang="fr">In closing, I want to say that, in a spirit of co-operation and working for the common good, a climate law needs to be ambitious. What is more, the government must not ignore what the opposition parties are saying. Let us get motivated. We will get there.</p>
