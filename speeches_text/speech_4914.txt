<p data-HoCid="8576756" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, that speech was incorrect and false on many fronts. I could go through some of it, but in the speech I gave earlier today and in the speech that my colleague from <a data-HoCid="278292" href="/politicians/lindsay-mathyssen/" title="Lindsay Mathyssen">Londonâ€”Fanshawe</a> gave, we were very clear that we are able to hold within ourselves the ability to be very critical and horrified by the actions of Hamas and Hezbollah, while also recognizing that Israel is not adhering to international law. Israel has killed 40,000 people in Gaza and razed Gaza to the ground.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576757" data-originallang="en">The member speaks about the rising anti-Semitism we have seen across the country, and I have expressed my horror at that. However, he is part of the Conservative Party that has not only targeted Israeli Canadians within the House, but has had three members meet with the far-right, fascist party from Germany. This is the same party that has had members of caucus stand in front of Nazi flags. We have seen time and time again that the Conservatives refuse to take ownership for the people within their caucus who bring up things like Hezbollah pagers to people within the House. It is disgraceful.</p>
