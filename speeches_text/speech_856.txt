<p data-HoCid="6649803" data-originallang="en">Members of the committee, in trying to get through this today and doing the work we had done previously, I was advised or directed or informed of how these things work. With all due respect to the comments that have been made, Madame Gill, for instance, was not able to point out the change in the bill that referred to the change in the preamble, whereas I believe that Mr. Battiste did. I may ask for guidance once again from the legislative clerks in this regard. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6649804" data-originallang="en"> I'll have Ms. Gazan speak and then I'll have a question for the committee. </p>
