<p data-HoCid="8293190" data-originallang="en"> I was consulted by <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">MP Gazan</a> and <a data-HoCid="278602" href="/politicians/pam-damoff/" title="Pam Damoff">MP Damoff</a> about a year ago. They asked very similar questions to what's happening right now. How does the official system work and how would you add the red dress alert? I provided pretty much all the same information I'm sharing today about that.</p>
