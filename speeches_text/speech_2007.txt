<p data-HoCid="7393549" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, when the <a data-HoCid="278914" href="/politicians/ahmed-hussen/" title="Ahmed Hussen">diversity minister</a> was confronted with his department's funding of a notorious anti-Semite Laith Marouf, he swore that it was a mistake and that it would never happen again, even though he covered it up for a month.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7393550" data-originallang="en">Now we know the <a data-HoCid="278914" href="/politicians/ahmed-hussen/" title="Ahmed Hussen">minister</a>'s sincerest promise was nothing more than lip service to the House, his caucus and to Canadians. Yesterday we found out there is more funding from the Department of Canadian Heritage. Nearly $30,000 was given to two news outlets that call for the elimination of Israel and perpetuate the dangerous hate against Jews. This is freely available on the Internet. Either nobody bothered to check, or more likely, nobody cared.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7393551" data-originallang="en">These are not unfortunate mistakes. They are not even incompetence. They are repeated actions by a government that is coming dangerously close to complicity with the worst anti-Semitism by spending Canadian tax dollars to proliferate it. We have a problem in this country. Canadians deserve to know about it. Conservatives are here to stop it. More members of the Liberal caucus need to stand up to it.</p>
