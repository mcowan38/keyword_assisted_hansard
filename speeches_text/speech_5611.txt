<p data-HoCid="8760406" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8760407" data-originallang="en">I want to speak to the motion we have on the floor. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8760408" data-originallang="en">I think this is a very important study. It needs to be done. I've been hearing from my constituents about the issues they have been facing to get their loved ones out of Gaza. I have heard horrific stories from many of my constituents who have parents, grandparents or siblings who have been having issues in getting out of Gaza.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8760409" data-originallang="en"> I think it will be an important study to hear from the government on how we can help reunite those families with their loved ones. In the last 13 months, we have seen the deaths of close to 50,000 people, innocent Palestinians, who have been killed in Gaza. The Canadians here who are Canadian citizens or PRs are living by their phones. Many family members have lost close to 10 or 20 people. Every family you talk to has lost so many loved ones.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8760410" data-originallang="en">It will be good for us to hear and see what challenges the government is having and how we can make sure that we facilitate the people living in Gaza to get out of Gaza. The famine that many people are facing is really mind-boggling for all of us.</p>
