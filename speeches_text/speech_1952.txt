<p data-HoCid="7468721" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7468722" data-originallang="fr">I have a quick question for you, Mr. Brown.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7468723" data-originallang="fr">You yourself mentioned the difficulty customs officers have in determining whether something is coming from Xinjiang or not. I look forward to receiving your brief to get the details of your proposals. That said, aren't your proposals likely to come up against the same constraints, that is to say that we won't be able to distinguish, among products coming from China, what specifically comes from Xinjiang, just as it's impossible for us at the moment to determine whether a product coming from Israel was made in the occupied territories?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7468724" data-originallang="fr">How can we get around this difficulty?</p>
