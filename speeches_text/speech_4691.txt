<p data-HoCid="8519863" data-originallang="en">There are several entities. One of the most concerning entities is the presence of the Islamic Students Association of Canada. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8519864" data-originallang="en">This entity, as I mentioned, is directly part of the Office of the Supreme Leader Beit-e Rahbari structure. It has had direct contact with IRGC commanders in the U.K. branch and the U.K. branch of the Islamic Students Association and has hosted eight IRGC commanders as these IRGC commanders propagated and glorified IRGC terrorism. They propagated extreme anti-Semitism and they even called on British and European Muslim students to join their apocalyptic army that will “bring an end to the life of the oppressors and occupiers, Zionists and Jews across the world”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8519865" data-originallang="en">This association has a branch in Canada. We have also seen there are entities in Canada that have been propagating IRGC-affiliated propaganda anthems. As I said, <em>Salute, Commander</em> was a propaganda anthem that was created in Iran by the IRGC. </p>
