<p data-HoCid="8220460" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, there is so much consensus that maybe we'll have consensus here as well.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8220461" data-originallang="en">I seek the committee's support to ensure that after the <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">minister</a> comes to the committee as soon as possible on the Gaza-Sudan motion, we prioritize the motion on the international students, because that too is very current and urgent.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8220462" data-originallang="en">For the sequential order, we'd have the minister appear on Sudan and Gaza, and then the next priority would be the international students.</p>
