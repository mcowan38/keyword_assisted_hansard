<p data-HoCid="8576498" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, immediately prior to coming to this debate, I was at the Subcommittee on International Human Rights, where we are having hearings on the terrible situation in Sudan. The connection between those events and these events, and frankly much of the violence we see around the world, is the role being played by the Iranian regime, which is seeking to expand its control. It is now terrorizing the people of Lebanon through Hezbollah and the people of Palestinian territories through Hamas. It is terrorizing the people of Iran through its continuing control of Iran. It is present in Iraq, Yemen and many other places. We should have acted much earlier.</p>
