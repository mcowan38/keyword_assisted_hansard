<p data-HoCid="7936326" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Chair, colleagues, seeing you again is always a pleasure, despite the unfortunate circumstances, to put it mildly.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936327" data-originallang="fr">I would like to thank the member for <a data-HoCid="278667" href="/politicians/anthony-rota/" title="Anthony Rota">Nipissing—Timiskaming</a> for promoting a collegial atmosphere here and for accomplishing so much at a time of tremendous change in the House of Commons.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936328" data-originallang="fr">I am not here to stand against anyone. I am here because I have convictions that I believe could help us approach our responsibilities as parliamentarians differently.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936329" data-originallang="fr">I feel it is vital that the House invite diplomatic and community representatives of the Jewish and Polish communities to the chamber as soon as possible so we can express our dismay to them and offer our apologies. History cannot be rewritten, and I believe that we all share a collective duty of remembrance.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936330" data-originallang="fr">We are 338 individuals among the 40 million Canadians who chose us to make laws for them on matters that concern their present and, now more than ever, their future. I am keenly aware of the incredible honour that the people of Brossard—Saint‑Lambert have done me, and of the responsibilities I have undertaken since I was first elected.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936331" data-originallang="en">Some of those responsibilities include and depend on the constant quest for truthfulness and the common good.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936332" data-originallang="en">I also believe that one of our responsibilities is to find joy in the work we do. Loving what we do, this place where we do it and the people who help us do it, for me, is a fundamental aspect of a successful parliamentary life. It cannot and should not be all about insults and accusations, about “gotcha” moments and questionable statements.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936333" data-originallang="en">I associate some of the most meaningful hours I have experienced in the House with debates where members strove to find shared goals. Emergency and take-note debates, private members' bills and motions, and even some legislative initiatives are often moments where we find our better natures. This is the place where Canada's important conversations should be held, where we seriously debate and where we humourously disagree.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936334" data-originallang="fr">What I take away from those moments is that we are all quite capable of rising above partisan sparring when that is what is called for, and that some of our colleagues' sense of humour seasons what would otherwise be dry or overly technical conversations with a zesty <em>je ne sais quoi</em>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936335" data-originallang="en">Holding the government to account is the essential element of parliamentary democracy. No government is immune from the necessary scrutiny of its proposed legislation and its management of the public accounts, but Canadians have told us time and again that they expect us to do this with far more civility than they see in this place every day.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936336" data-originallang="en">Reject me if you must, but should I be given the honour of being elected to the Chair, I would strive with all my might to bring dignity to our debates by enforcing the rules that we have all chosen to adhere to. I believe in the rules and regulations that govern the House of Commons. I believe in the office of the Speaker that oversees the functioning and administration of this place. I believe in the Clerk and the table officers who guide us and provide us with their knowledge and their independent analysis.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936337" data-originallang="fr">Dignity is a principle I care deeply about. The humanity of every person in the House, elected or otherwise, must be respected. That is why I value things like a simple thanks to the page who brings us a glass of water or a lectern, a respectful awareness of the monumental task performed by our interpreters, recognition of the sensitive work carried out by the table officers, and acceptance that, despite our differences, each and every one of us is here for the same reason: to make good laws.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936338" data-originallang="fr">Joy is also a principle of enormous importance to me. The joy of music is an eternal source of wonder. As everyone knows, because I announced it two years ago, I hope to create a parliamentary choir. That has been a dream of mine for many years.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936339" data-originallang="en">Over my many years in this place I have heard people, including journalists, staff and sometimes you members, suggest that some of the traditions and rituals we observe are silly, arcane or outdated. I tend to disagree, but that does not mean that we should not try to create new rituals that will in turn become traditions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7936340" data-originallang="en">This is the people's House and we are only the temporary occupants and guardians of it. Our predecessors fought hard for our rights as parliamentarians. If you elect me as your Speaker, I promise to continue that fight by doing everything in my power to ensure MPs have a safe, productive and collaborative environment to do the work that they deserve.</p>
