<p data-HoCid="7346040" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7346041" data-originallang="en">Speaking to the amendment and to this motion, I'd like to say that this has been profoundly.... On my behalf and on behalf of the Jewish community and the francophone community that desperately wanted answers today, this motion tabled at this time is a complete affront—a slap in the face, I would say—to combatting racism, xenophobia and all forms of hate in this country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7346042" data-originallang="en">The questions that communities are asking us to ask on their behalf.... They're arguing about it right now on Twitter. As a matter of fact, CIJA thanked me and Minister Hussen for the work that we've done, and there is more to be done.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7346043" data-originallang="en">Instead of getting to that today, we saw Conservatives hide, as they do, behind hashtags and handles of misogyny and racism, and try to put up a front that has absolutely nothing to do with addressing the needs of vulnerable communities today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7346044" data-originallang="en">I don't support the motion. I don't support the amendment. It was a waste of the time of the Jewish and francophone communities today, and many other communities. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7346045" data-originallang="en">At this point, Madam Chair, since I have the floor, I move to adjourn.</p>
