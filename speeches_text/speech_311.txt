<p data-HoCid="6319926" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I was deeply moved by the member for <a data-HoCid="253019" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>. I am always interested and moved by the personal stories she shares, which are important perspectives to hear in this place.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6319927" data-originallang="en">I hear from indigenous people in my riding that reconciliation is dead or it is just a word. What would the member see as the priorities to move on next from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's recommendations? It is important to have this day, to recognize it and commemorate it, but what would she like to see us move on next as a Parliament?</p>
