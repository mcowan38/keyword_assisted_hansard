<p data-HoCid="7988467" data-originallang="en">When the war on Ukraine happened, the Ukrainian community here was able to send blankets, food aid and medical aid into Ukraine. Has anything been coordinated in Canada to help families send aid into Israel, into Gaza? </p>
<p data-HoCid="7988468" data-originallang="en">I understand that Gaza has its own set of problems today, but two weeks from now, it could be a different scenario. What are we doing to assist people to at least feel that they're contributing to helping out? We see protesters, and they're frustrated because they feel they can do nothing to help their families. Are we putting together a program there? Have you looked at that? </p>
