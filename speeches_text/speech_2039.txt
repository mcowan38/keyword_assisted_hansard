<p data-HoCid="7547632" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have a chance to compliment the hon. member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> on her speech. Something I did not know we had in common is that we are both single mothers, and we had to manage that challenge without affordable child care. I was very blessed to be able to manage it well, and I have a fantastic 31-year-old daughter. The member and I share that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7547633" data-originallang="en">I want to ask the hon. member this, and I promise, from my heart, that this is not intended to be partisan.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7547634" data-originallang="en"> If it were not for the perverse first-past-the-post system, I do not believe for a minute that, in the fall of 2005, we would have had the Conservatives, backed by the Bloc and the NDP, bring down the minority government of Paul Martin. It had a Kyoto plan that would have worked, child care agreements signed by every single province, and the Kelowna accord, which are things we all care about. Only because of the use of the strategy that the first-past-the-post system would eventually deliver a majority government with a minority of votes, did we see the loss of those things that could have provided child care back in 2005.</p>
