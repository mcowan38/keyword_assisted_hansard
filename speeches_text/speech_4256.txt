<p data-HoCid="8435041" data-originallang="en">B'nai Brith has been frustrated by some of what has been transpiring in some of the messaging we've heard from the federal government. We believe the federal government has put in place some strong precedents in terms of their commitment, such as the 2024 commitment to preserving Holocaust remembrance and to combatting anti-Semitism. However, now more than ever we need actuation on this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435042" data-originallang="en">As Mr. Marceau said in his remarks, words are small. We need action, and the Jewish community needs a strong response from all members of Parliament. Fighting anti-Semitism cannot be a partisan issue.</p>
