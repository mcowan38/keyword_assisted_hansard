<p data-HoCid="6740550" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, throughout history, Jews have experienced ongoing anti-Semitism with waves of pogroms, expulsions and genocide around the world. There are intergenerational sensibilities that this history carries. Canada, too, once added to their plight, when on the eve of World War II, 907 Jewish refugees aboard the MS <em>St. Louis</em> were refused entry into Canada. Later, 254 would face death and the atrocities of Nazi concentration camps. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6740551" data-originallang="en">Lately, our country has seen a spike of hate and intimidation against Jewish communities. There is no place in Canada for vandalism of synagogues, violence or threats against people just because of their race or religion. No one should have to live in fear because of their cultural identity. “Never again” means standing against anti-Semitism whenever it rears its ugly head, starting in our own backyard, right here in Canada.</p>
