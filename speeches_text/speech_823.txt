<p data-HoCid="6647268" data-originallang="en">I also need to examine the Ontario report, but it was very clearly stated in a sound bite coming from that report that a six-week stay-at-home order along with a vaccination rate of at least 100,000 doses a day is the only way to flatten the curve. Ontario also has the same message, which is that you need both right now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6647269" data-originallang="en">The United Kingdom has shown—they are ahead of us, of course, so we look to them for data—that despite a very high vaccination rate, they've kept up some very stringent public health measures and are relaxing them very, very cautiously. Israel is another country. We've done a lot of modelling, but we also look at the real-life data. Israel has a high rate of vaccination. The moment they relaxed a little between February and March, they had a resurgence. They had to push back down on the stringent public health measures a bit more, while getting more people vaccinated. That points us towards the kind of strategy we're going to have to have.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6647270" data-originallang="en">That, together with vaccines, is the only way to combat the variants.</p>
