<p data-HoCid="6438447" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Keslick. I have only so much time, so I'll keep going here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6438448" data-originallang="en">This is really for either you or Mr. Sanchez. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6438449" data-originallang="en">The Canadian Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs made a submission to our committee to add an amendment for greater clarity. I would note that even <a data-HoCid="253705" href="/politicians/david-lametti/" title="David Lametti">Minister Lametti</a> started his testimony on this bill saying that there seems to be some confusion about its scope. Taking the testimony in its entirety, I would agree with that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6438450" data-originallang="en">He just said that they would add a definition in the bill because it does not include private conversations in which personal views on sexual orientation, sexual behaviour, sexual identity or sexual expression, feelings or gender identity are expressed by parents, legal guardians, family members, friends, teachers, school counsellors, pastoral counsellors, faith leaders, religious leaders or health care professionals. This language was, at one time at least, on the justice department's website. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6438451" data-originallang="en">I'm just wondering if the two of you can comment on whether you feel this would be a step in the right direction in giving more clarity and better defining what this bill is aimed at. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6438452" data-originallang="en">Mr. Keslick, you put your hand up first.</p>
