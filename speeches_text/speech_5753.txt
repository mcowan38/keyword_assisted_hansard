<p data-HoCid="8784218" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much, Mr. Robertson.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8784219" data-originallang="en">Hearing that, I would like to revisit a motion that I presented two weeks ago with respect to this very issue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8784220" data-originallang="en">I want to begin by talking about how it's ironic that we're talking about freedom of expression when it comes to one of the most fundamental issues that this committee has had to deal with, which is Library and Archives' refusal, under the <a data-HoCid="300004" href="/politicians/pascale-st-onge/" title="Pascale St-Onge">Minister of Heritage</a>, to publicize the names of Nazis in the DeschÃªnes report. This deliberate policy to not release the names of known Nazis who were consciously and directly admitted to Canada in the early 1950s must be repealed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8784221" data-originallang="en"> I cannot think of what this ongoing refusal to release the names means to survivors and the families of survivors. I think of the experience of my own family and the people who fought the Nazis, and how historic Jewish communities in Greece and across Europe were entirely wiped out, not just by Nazis, but also by collaborators.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8784222" data-originallang="en"> I cannot believe that in Canada in 2024, we are still discussing whether or not the Canadian government should bring to light the names of Nazis who engaged in the Holocaust and the systematic murder of Jews, Poles, Roma and many others.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8784223" data-originallang="en">With International Holocaust Remembrance Day coming up, what better time than now for Canada to own up to its dark history? This is about freedom of expression. This is about freedom of information. We need the Government of Canada and, particularly, the <a data-HoCid="300004" href="/politicians/pascale-st-onge/" title="Pascale St-Onge">Minister of Heritage</a> to change course and direct Library and Archives Canada to release the names.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8784224" data-originallang="en">I would like to revisit this motion, and I hope all members of all parties will support it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8784225" data-originallang="en">I move that, given that the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage regrets the continued protection given by the Minister of Canadian Heritage to the estimated 900 Nazis who were allowed to enter Canada after the Second World War by refusing to release their names and refusing to listen to organizations representing victims of the Nazis, the committee invite the Minister of Canadian Heritage to instruct Libraries and Archives Canada to release the names of the 900 Nazis before International Holocaust Remembrance Day on Monday, January 27, 2025, and that this motion be reported to the House.</p>
