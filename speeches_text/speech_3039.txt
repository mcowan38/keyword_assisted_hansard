<p data-HoCid="8025022" data-originallang="en">Ms. Gazan, I appreciate the question and your very significant concern in this area. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8025023" data-originallang="en">What I would say to you is this: In the normal course, I don't discuss any application that is pending in the system, because it's ultimately going to come on my desk for a decision. I know that, in the case of the two Quewezance individuals you mentioned, they have themselves disclosed the fact that they put in an application. I would refer you back to what Ms. Besner said earlier, in her testimony: The length of time spent on a file varies depending on the complexity of the file. It's very difficult to ascertain. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8025024" data-originallang="en">As a further elaboration on your last question, the point, Ms. Gazan, is that we can't guarantee how many, quantifiably, will come in from Black, indigenous or female accused. What you will have prior to the five-year parliamentary review is this: On an annual basis, you'll have parliamentary reports that show the demographic data on applicants coming into the system. When a report like that is tabled, it's incumbent on all of us, as parliamentarians, to try to identify patterns and say, “Well, maybe there needs to be more done on outreach with indigenous women or Black men”—whatever the case may be.</p>
