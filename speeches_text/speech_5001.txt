<p data-HoCid="8628409" data-originallang="en">I also want to take a moment to recognize the fact that this is meant to be evergreen. This is meant to evolve with the needs of the communities. We're constantly going to be listening to communities to make sure that their voices are included and to ensure that we are at the forefront of leading this work. We continue to have very meaningful conversations, and it's not just me. My predecessor had many conversations prior to my taking on this role. This is work that takes time. This is work in which we need to make sure that we are pragmatic and that we're thoughtful in the conversations that we have with people. Everyone can see in the strategy that they're reflected in it.</p>
