<p data-HoCid="6996404" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for <a data-HoCid="278257" href="/politicians/kevin-lamoureux/" title="Kevin Lamoureux">Winnipeg North</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6996405" data-originallang="en">I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this motion to create the parliamentary review committee per subsection 62(1) of the Emergencies Act. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6996406" data-originallang="en">For three weeks, blockades illegally disrupted our daily lives here in Ottawa and across the country. They harmed our economy and endangered our public safety. In my riding of Vancouver Granville, health care workers, moms and seniors were worried and afraid as the convoy came through and there were threats of further protests. We saw displays of anti-indigenous racism, of anti-Semitism and of misogyny. We saw vandalism, harassment and expressions of hate and violence. We saw abuse of the press. We saw the vile misuse of the Canadian flag and indeed of the word “freedom” itself.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6996407" data-originallang="en">For three weeks, we heard from residents of Ottawa who were afraid to leave their homes and were held hostage, and from businesses that had to stay closed to keep themselves and their employees safe. For three weeks, day after day we heard about and saw members of the Conservative Party meeting with the occupiers, taking them coffee, eating meals with them and celebrating what they stood for and what they were doing. They celebrated the actions of those blockaders, many of whom are now charged with crimes ranging from mischief to conspiracy to commit murder.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6996408" data-originallang="en">This is no joke. Our democracy should not be treated as an opportunity by the opposition to build mistrust or to peddle misinformation. The very same party that sought to deceive Canadians as to what was actually happening here in Ottawa and across the country now wants to control the very review of the action taken to stop the illegal occupation of Ottawa.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6996409" data-originallang="en">The Conservative Party has chosen to peddle untruths to Canadians. The member for <a data-HoCid="278176" href="/politicians/cheryl-gallant/" title="Cheryl Gallant">Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke</a> said in a video, “The fact is, RCMP have an ongoing investigation into Trudeau’s obstruction of justice.”</p>
