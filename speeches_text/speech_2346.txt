<p data-HoCid="7735669" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7735670" data-originallang="en">Thank you to my colleague. I agree with her. We do want to listen to experts in the field and the evidence that guides us towards a better system for kids across this country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7735671" data-originallang="en">Chair, I have a small subamendment to what Ms. Gazan is proposing, which I'd like to read.</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7735672" data-originallang="en"> That the Minister may, on request of the Council, provide the Council with any information respecting the Canada-wide early learning and child care system that is related to the Council's functions and that is in the Minister's possession, if it is within the Minister's authority to share the information. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7735673" data-originallang="en">As always, we want to make sure that there is a collaborative effort and approach to this. We want to be supportive, rather than prescriptive, understanding jurisdiction and the roles that each level of government plays in creating this system.</p>
