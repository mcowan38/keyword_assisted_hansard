<p data-HoCid="6762583" data-originallang="fr">Madam Speaker, this is nothing new.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6762584" data-originallang="fr">I remind members that in the 1930s, when a boat filled with Jewish refugees arrived on our shores, the Canadian prime minister turned it away, saying, “None is too many”. A Canadian prime minister said that. Should history be repeated today? I do not think so. I do not think anyone wants to be on the wrong side of history on the issue we are debating today, which affects all of us.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6762585" data-originallang="fr">I have to tell my colleague that I also cannot understand the government's position on this. We could give our Uighur friends some hope by calling it a genocide. Hope is what they need now, and the government could make a difference.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6762586" data-originallang="fr">I still have faith that the government will come to its senses and do that. I believe that the government is capable of doing it. What I do not know is whether it wants to.</p>
