<p data-HoCid="8823210" data-originallang="en">I have a statement here by a witness who appeared before the justice committee—Rachel Cook from the University of Alberta.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8823211" data-originallang="en">She said:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8823212" data-originallang="en"> I think the EDI system has made the problem [of anti-Semitism] worse.... </p>
<p data-HoCid="8823213" data-originallang="en"> I think it can start at the top, but it also starts in institutions and in massively funding EDI programming, such that, quite literally, when I asked who decides who is in these EDI meetings—is it a percentage of population?—their response was, well, it's the groups that deserve equity and deserve inclusion. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8823214" data-originallang="en">Minister, I'd like to ask who deserves equity and inclusion, in your mind.</p>
