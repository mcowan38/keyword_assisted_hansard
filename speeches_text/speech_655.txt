<p data-HoCid="6538215" data-originallang="en"> We're seeing some studies coming out of Israel where they have vaccinated a large part of their population with the Pfizer vaccine. We have to be careful. It's not the same with all vaccines. The adenovirus phase and the RNA are very different. The studies show a partial response of between 50% and 70% with the Pfizer vaccine. The second dose is far more effective. </p>
