<p data-HoCid="8147761" data-originallang="en">I agree with you that it has fallen off for Canada. Canada, of all countries, must be one of those countries that leads on this. We have to have that ability to lead.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8147762" data-originallang="en">I've asked the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">minister</a> and representatives from Global Affairs a number of times why Canada is not supporting international justice mechanisms, like the the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice, in the context of Israel and Palestine. I'm very pleased to see that we are supporting those investigations in places like Ukraine, but we are applying the use of these courts very irregularly. For the rest of the world watching how we apply international humanitarian law, it must seem baffling—that's probably the best-case scenario, be perfectly honest. There's a very clear double standard.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8147763" data-originallang="en">In your experience, what can parliamentarians do and what can committee members do to put pressure on the Government of Canada to use the ICC and ICJ and to apply international humanitarian law equally in all contexts where it would be applicable?</p>
