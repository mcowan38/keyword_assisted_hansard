<p data-HoCid="8679113" data-originallang="en"> Thank you Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679114" data-originallang="en"> I want to thank Ms. Verrier-Fréchette for her testimony.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679115" data-originallang="en">When we're looking at this issue, I think it's important.... If people are just tuning in now, they might be under the incorrect notion that this conversation has never taken place before, but there have been many attempts in modern history to make peace and to have two states.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679116" data-originallang="en">Some examples are the United Nations partition plan, which led to the establishment of the State of Israel; the Camp David accords; the Madrid conference; the Oslo accords; and the Camp David summit. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679117" data-originallang="en">Even though this wasn't a peace negotiation, I think you could argue that it was a precursor to what happened on October 7: the decision of the Sharon government to disengage from Gaza. There were Israeli citizens living there. The Israeli government actually went there, dismantled settlements of its own citizens and moved them back into Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679118" data-originallang="en">There have been very legitimate, sincere attempts over the years by the Israeli government to make peace and to have two states living side by side in peace and security. Would you not agree, Ms. Verrier-Fréchette?</p>
