<p data-HoCid="8564983" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I think we can all agree as a House that the best way to make sure that Gazans are safe is to make sure there is a ceasefire, so we can continue to work with people to get people here who have connections to family members and who are looking to be reunited with them. We will continue, as a government, to work with the authorities on the ground, whether we agree with their positions or not, to make sure those people are kept safe, and we will continue to work to make sure those people get to Canada in an expeditious fashion. </p>
