<p data-HoCid="8479604" data-originallang="en">From my perspective, the peaceful protests happening in Canada show the good side of Muslims. For example, we have lots of Christians and Jewish people coming to support us. It just shows, since they're very peaceful protests, that they're not doing anything illegal.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479605" data-originallang="en">I think people are changing their minds about Islam. Lots of people I've met have started reading about Islam, they've started liking Islam and they've shared their opinion with me about Islam. It's helping to reduce Islamophobia rather than increase it. That's my opinion. </p>
