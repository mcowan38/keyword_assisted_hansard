<p data-HoCid="8202385" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, as the <a data-HoCid="300669" href="/politicians/pam-damoff/" title="Pam Damoff">parliamentary secretary</a> knows, there is no agreed-upon definition of the term “non-lethal equipment”. However, I can share what Global Affairs shared with The Maple on its ATIP request during the first two months of the war in Gaza. GAC issued permits worth a total of $18.4 million that covered military items categorized as electronic equipment, $9.2 million more for aircraft, lighter-than-air aircraft. The list goes on and on.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8202386" data-originallang="en">If we can have a reasonable conversation to be clear that these are the permits that GAC has made clear have been issued, if that is the case, and it is the case, in light of the ICJ decision, in light of our own Export and Import Permits Act, when will the Liberal government, along with other important calls that it has made, as has been shared this evening, end all permits for military equipment to the State of Israel?</p>
