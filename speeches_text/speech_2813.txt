<p data-HoCid="7988482" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988483" data-originallang="en">Good morning to the officials. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7988484" data-originallang="en">I also want to add my personal gratitude to everyone here and to all at their offices who are working around the clock diligently to assist Canadians who are in need and to figure out the best that Canada can do to offer peace and stability in the region. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7988485" data-originallang="en">I'm going to start with a question that I'm curious about. In the opening remarks, I heard reference to “the West Bank” and “Gaza” repeatedly. Are we no longer referring to them as “Palestinian territories”? </p>
