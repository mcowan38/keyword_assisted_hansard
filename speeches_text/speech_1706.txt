<p data-HoCid="7150378" data-originallang="en">I did want to ask you, in terms of the impact, if you think there's a connection between these movements on university campuses and protests that we see in support of the BDS movement. For example, in Toronto, as I'm sure you're aware, recently there was a large protest from the BDS perspective. They were chanting things like “From the river to the sea Palestine will be free”, which is in reference to a one-state solution. Can you comment on whether you think there's a connection between these elements that are happening on university campuses and the extremist, hateful rhetoric we're hearing in many of these protests in Toronto and elsewhere?</p>
