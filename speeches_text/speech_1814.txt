<p data-HoCid="7269808" data-originallang="fr">Thank you very much, Ms. Gazan.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7269809" data-originallang="fr"> I do not consider the issues and topics that affect first peoples to be strictly aboriginal issues. These are cross-cutting issues that concern or affect us as they would in the case of a person from Quebec or the Northwest Territories.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7269810" data-originallang="fr">We must have independent and safe spaces, bringing together a multitude of human, scientific and theoretical expertise and experience, which will ensure that the truth is always maintained. I repeat that calls for justice are legal imperatives. If there is an injustice, we will denounce it in the right place and we know that it will be treated correctly and respectfully and that it will influence policies, laws or the way things are done in Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7269811" data-originallang="fr">For its part, the initiative or project approach does not work, as we have seen with the passing decades.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7269812" data-originallang="fr">If those spaces I mentioned, whether it's an ombudsman's office or a committee, have the ability and the right to report to Parliament, that will also help you, whether you're in the opposition or the government, to honour the changes that are long overdue. Until we have that, Ms. Gazan, I will make it my "battle caribou."</p>
<p data-HoCid="7269813" data-originallang="en"> It's a French expression.</p>
