<p data-HoCid="6023815" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, yesterday the people of the United Kingdom went to the ballot box, and it was a great success for the Conservative and Unionist Party, the world's oldest and most successful political party. Our sister party was re-elected for a fourth mandate, putting Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the helm of a majority government.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6023816" data-originallang="en"> Despite a history of success, the party of Disraeli, Churchill and Thatcher notched another new record last night. The Tories are the first government in British history to be re-elected three times while scoring an increasing share of the vote every time. This result also reminds us that when elites try to substitute their own judgment for the will of the people, the people will have the final say. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6023817" data-originallang="en">When Conservatives are united and when they focus on the people, Conservatives will win. We extend congratulations to Prime Minister Johnson.</p>
