<p data-HoCid="8303087" data-originallang="en"> Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303088" data-originallang="en">Thank you for inviting me, and thank you for your time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303089" data-originallang="en">The title of my presentation is <em>Cui bono?</em> or “Who benefits?” I'm not going to read it. I'm going to simply speak to some of the points, but I believe you've all received it in both official languages.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303090" data-originallang="en">At the invitation of the Speaker of the House of Commons, Yaroslav Hunka was present in the House during the visit to Canada of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. When it was subsequently reported on left-wing blogs that Mr. Hunka had served in the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS, more commonly referred to as the Galicia Division, a controversy erupted that has continued to fester to this day.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303091" data-originallang="en">Now, there are a few things I want to point out right at the start.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303092" data-originallang="en">I don't know Mr. Hunka. I've never met him.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303093" data-originallang="en">Second, my mother was kidnapped as a teenager and brought to the Third Reich as a slave labourer during the Second World War, so I have absolutely no interest in defending any Nazi who may still be alive. Let's be very clear about that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303094" data-originallang="en">I was, however, also a member of the Civil Liberties Commission representing the Ukrainian Canadian community during the commission inquiry on war criminals, so I think I'm one of the only people in this room who was there and was part of the investigation that examined the allegations that thousands of Nazi war criminals had somehow managed to get into Canada. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8303095" data-originallang="en">I was present in the lockdown with the Minister of Justice, Ramon Hnatyshyn, when he revealed the commission's findings to the Baltic, Jewish and Ukrainian communities. Along with a representative of the Canadian Jewish Congress, Irwin Cotler, whom you all know, I appeared on the CBC program <em>The Journal</em> with Barbara Frum on March 12, 1987, and welcomed the findings of the Deschênes commission.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303096" data-originallang="en">At that time, our community had a suspicion that Soviet agents and their fellow travellers in the west had provoked this controversy over the alleged presence of thousands of Nazi war criminals in North America. Only recently, we have come up with documentary evidence. There was a 1985 KGB document describing something called “operation payback”, which was a disinformation campaign started in the 1970s intended to stoke tensions between the Jewish, Baltic and Ukrainian diasporas. That subterfuge worked very well at the time, and it works well to this day. In fact, it is now being deployed to distract attention from Russia's genocidal war against Ukraine and Ukrainians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303097" data-originallang="en"> I'm not going to go into the position of the Ukrainian Canadian community on bringing war criminals to justice. That's already been explained. Unfortunately, Canada has never properly investigated how alleged Soviet and Communist war criminals and collaborators managed to get into this country. Some did, even individuals who openly boasted of what they had done on behalf of the Stalinist regime in the ranks of the NKVD, Smersh and KGB. Government records about all those persons should also now be made available. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8303098" data-originallang="en">Now let's look at the evidence with respect to Mr. Hunka.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303099" data-originallang="en">First of all, Mr. Hunka was never a Nazi. He was never a former Nazi. No Ukrainian could ever be a member of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, the Nazis, because Ukrainians, like all other Slavs, were considered to be subhumans. They weren't Aryans. They were subhumans,<em>Untermenschen</em>, so they could never be Nazis. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8303100" data-originallang="en">Every individual who served in the armed forces of the Third Reich during the Second World War, and that's millions of people in total, was obliged to swear an oath to Adolf Hitler. That, obviously, did not make them all into Nazis, including about a quarter of a million Germans who immigrated to Canada in the 1950s.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303101" data-originallang="en">Indisputably, Mr. Hunka served with the Galicia Division. Why? Why did he enlist? I found a letter in my research that he wrote on September 22, 2015, years before there was any controversy about him. In that, he provides an explanation about why he joined. He volunteered as a young man, as a teenager, in western Ukraine after the first Soviet occupation of that region. Between mid-September 1939 and late June 1941, Mr. Hunka witnessed massacres perpetrated by the Soviets against innocent civilians. He witnessed the deportation of family members to Siberia, where some of them died, so, as he wrote, “I hated everything Russian”. That's what he wrote years ago.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303102" data-originallang="en">He joined and he served to the end of the war. He was interned in Rimini in northeastern Italy after the war, and we'll come back to that in a moment. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8303103" data-originallang="en">When the Deschênes commission in 1985 through 1987 investigated the issue of alleged Nazi war criminals in Canada, it came to a number of specific conclusions about the Galicia Division that everyone seems to have forgotten. One was that the division, the Galicia Division, should not be indicted as a group. Two was that members of the division had been screened. Indeed, they were screened by the British, by the Americans and by the Canadians, including people I personally knew, and even by the Soviets.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303104" data-originallang="en"> Charges of war crimes against members of the division were never substantiated. In the absence of knowledge or evidence of specific war crimes, Mr. Justice Deschênes said, “mere membership in the Galicia Division is insufficient to justify prosecution.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303105" data-originallang="en">He also concluded that, because these people had come to Canada after 1950 with the full knowledge of the Government of Canada and Canadian authorities were aware of who these men were, they could not have their citizenship revoked because it had been granted to them normally through the naturalization process.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303106" data-originallang="en">What does all that mean with respect to Mr. Hunka? It means simply that he came to Canada legally in 1954. His wartime record with the Galicia Division was well known, and no one complained.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303107" data-originallang="en">Now, I'm going to underscore that there were, understandably, concerns raised by the Canadian Jewish Congress in the autumn of 1950: Who are these people? Why are they being allowed to come to Canada? In fact, the government, at the cabinet level, asked the High Commissioner of Canada in the United Kingdom, L. Dana Wilgress, to investigate this. He did, and he dismissed those allegations about the Galicia Division as being nothing but Communist propaganda. As he also added in his report to cabinet, “it is interesting to note that no specific charges of war crimes have been made” by the Soviet or any other government “against any member of this group”. That rather astute assessment seems to have been forgotten.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303108" data-originallang="en">What am I here to do today? As I said, I don't know Mr. Hunka, but when I look at the facts of his life, here's what I find. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8303109" data-originallang="en">As a teenager, he fought in defence of Ukraine because of what he had witnessed the Soviets do to Ukrainians between 1939 and 1941. He had nothing to do with the persecution of any minority group. At the war's end, he became a prisoner of war. Later, he became an immigrant and, finally, a naturalized Canadian citizen. He served in the Canadian Army, in the militia, from 1963 to 1965, and he swore an oath to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. He worked hard, he raised a family, he paid his taxes, he broke no laws that I'm aware of in Canada and he contributed for 70 years to the general welfare of his adopted country. However, disregarding the principles of natural justice, many members of Parliament from all parties denounced Yaroslav Hunka for being something he never was—a Nazi.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303110" data-originallang="en">The fundamental principle of our justice system, ladies and gentlemen, is that a person is innocent until proven guilty. Given that there is no evidence of any kind of any wartime criminality on the part of Mr. Hunka, I'd like to say that the House of Commons owes an innocent man, and our fellow Canadian, a public apology.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8303111" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
