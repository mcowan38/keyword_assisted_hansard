<p data-HoCid="7659690" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to ask the hon. member a question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7659691" data-originallang="en">I am curious as to whether the member thinks there should be consequences or reprimands for members of the House who meet with known Nazis who spread misinformation and disinformation, who glorify the Holocaust and who speak against anti-Muslim rhetoric. If the member is talking about online hate, privacy of Canadians and regulation, does she condemn her actions by meeting with a known Nazi who spouts anti-Muslim rhetoric?</p>
