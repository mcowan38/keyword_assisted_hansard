<p data-HoCid="7957868" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague on his speech.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957869" data-originallang="fr">We agree that a humanitarian corridor must be urgently set up to save civilians. To be a player, one must work with other players. Unfortunately, Canada is not at the table where decisions are being made by certain players. I am thinking about France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States and Italy, who met to speak out against the situation and to find solutions to the crisis that Palestine and Israel are in right now. Canada was not at the table.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957870" data-originallang="fr">I would like my colleague to explain how he thinks his government can establish its credibility on the international stage and take its place not just as an observer, but as a player.</p>
