<p data-HoCid="8019114" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8019115" data-originallang="en">I would say that I support this motion, because I am very concerned about the rise of anti-Semitism in the country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8019116" data-originallang="en">We see from this Laith Marouf incident that he hasn't paid the money back. There was no consequence to him. There was no consequence to Minister Hussen or Minister Rodriguez at the time. Now we're seeing, within our country, a rise in anti-Semitism inflamed by the situation in Israel and Gaza. We have Jewish children afraid to go to school. We have clear pro-Hamas demonstrations happening in the country. People are saying to me, “Where are the police? Where are the consequences? Where is the action? What will the government do to stop this rising anti-Semitism, so Jewish people can be free here in Canada to worship in safety?” </p>
<p data-HoCid="8019117" data-originallang="en">I think this is the tip of the spear, as they say. I certainly support this resolution. I think it makes a point that there needs to be consequences for anti-Semitism in our country, and it begins here.</p>
