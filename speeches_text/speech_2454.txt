<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, the final petition that I am presenting today deals with recommendations of the <a data-HoCid="278899" href="/politicians/anita-anand/" title="Anita Anand">Minister of National Defence</a>'s advisory panel on systemic racism. In its final report in 2022, this panel paradoxically recommended discrimination on the basis of religious affiliation in determinations about chaplaincy and discrimination against religious communities holding views that are not consistent with the Government of Canada's positions on, for instance, various sexuality issues.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Petitioners believe that Canadian Armed Forces chaplains serve all members of the armed forces without discrimination, and they should not be facing discrimination. This proposed discrimination would affect the Muslim community, the Christian community, the Jewish community and other religious communities in Canada. They call on the Government of Canada to reject the recommendations on chaplaincy in the Canadian Armed Forces in the final report of the <a data-HoCid="278899" href="/politicians/anita-anand/" title="Anita Anand">Minister of National Defence</a>'s advisory panel on systemic racism and discrimination, as well as to affirm the right of all Canadians, including Canadian Armed Forces chaplains, to freedom of religion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">I commend all these petitions to the consideration of my colleagues.</p>
