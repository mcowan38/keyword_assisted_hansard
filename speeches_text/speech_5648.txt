<p data-HoCid="8733943" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733944" data-originallang="en"> I again want to thank my colleagues for undertaking this important work.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733945" data-originallang="en">Thank you to the witnesses for supplying what I believe to be very good expert testimony that will definitely surely assist our analysts in the production of a very good report.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733946" data-originallang="en">I want to focus and spend time now on a situation that arises from my experience, my direct lived experience in a community. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8733947" data-originallang="en">In Edmonton Griesbach, I represent a great many concerned citizens who both exercise their freedom of expression rights and are also attempting to balance that with a very important need to bring in more people to a larger discussion. Any democratic society would hope to see that: to see an idea flourish to become a popular opinion and then, hopefully, see that become good, moral and sound policy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733948" data-originallang="en">What I've heard from my constituents, and what I think I hear right across the country, is that activists are feeling very nervous. They're feeling like they're walking on eggshells. We have Palestinian families that are crying out “injustice”, and they need to be seen. It's only Canadian to look to our neighbours and to support them in any way and in every best way that we can.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733949" data-originallang="en">Allies, progressive Jewish people across our country, right now are asking for nuance and for the ability for us to be able to hold two things at once: the very needed and important pursuit of justice for all people while also ensuring that we balance our democratic mission and our right to freedom of expression.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733950" data-originallang="en">I have heard from my constituents who were student activists engaged in the encampment at the University of Alberta and who got beaten. They showed me the scars, the bruises and the wounds they had endured for just simply speaking truth to power. Whether it was Palestinian families or organizations like the cultural Palestinian association of Canada, which is headquartered in Edmonton, they're seeing reports of people being targeted in their regular workplaces, being left and being terminated for simply speaking truth to power.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8733951" data-originallang="en">Now, Ga Grant, you probably heard the testimony given by Dr. Ge. You mentioned Dr. Ge. He mentioned that he faced attacks. He believes that those attacks were a direct influence on other people deciding to not speak up. Do you think that's the nature of why the police are cracking down on so much of this and that it may be the motivator behind anti-Palestinian racism?</p>
