<p data-HoCid="8693648" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693649" data-originallang="en">The objective of this study is to find out how we can get to a two-state solution, not whether we should. I want to say to the witnesses that this is not what we're here to talk about. Canada has long—for decades, actually—sought a two-state solution, as have many countries. Whether you think it's fair or not is not the issue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693650" data-originallang="en"> How does one get there? That's the question we want to ask. Canada has always supported a two-state solution, and Canada is basically saying, “How do we do this, in keeping with international law, fairness and justice?”</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693651" data-originallang="en"> It's obvious that neither of you supports a two-state solution, so I'm not going to ask you about that. It's about how we can get to that position. Generations of Palestinian and Jewish children are growing up in a place where they have no dreams and hope. Let's get to a solution and move forward. Can you tell me how we can do that? </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693652" data-originallang="en">Only stick to that, please.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693653" data-originallang="en">I will go to Mr. Kontorovich, who has his hand up. Please remember that I don't have much time. I don't want long answers. I want simple answers.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693654" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
