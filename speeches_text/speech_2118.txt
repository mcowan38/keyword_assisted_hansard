<p data-HoCid="7700756" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700757" data-originallang="en">I'm glad to be here and to be able to participate once again in this debate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700758" data-originallang="en">I've listened intently to the various conversations, and I find them interesting.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700759" data-originallang="en">I would like to start off with Mr. Barrett with respect to his comment that he feels that everything that needs to be said has been said and therefore the debate is over. While he may speak to his children in that way, we are not children. We have every right and ability to raise our concerns as much as we feel is needed, as we all have earned the right in this place to speak.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700760" data-originallang="en">I have sat through numerous filibusters from the Conservatives as they literally read out of a phone book or different literary novels. The fact is that the Conservatives are now criticizing Liberal members who are not, in fact, reading from a phone book but are raising very legitimate issues and concerns. To be chastised that they're heard enough doesn't really hold any water with me. I'm not surprised that they don't want to hear it, because, again, as I've said before, their minds are made up, and let's not be confused with the facts.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700761" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, I also heard throughout this debate some of the comments around having a public inquiry or not having a public inquiry. I understand those debates. I think it's fair that people would want to be talking about the merits. If you look in the media, you see, as my colleagues have pointed out, that many Conservatives have gone on the record on why a public inquiry isn't the right thing or why it would be. That's part of the public discourse. It's something that many people want to chat about and share their views on. For me, I don't have an issue with whether that is the appropriate debate. I think that's a very fair and reasonable thing that people want to debate the best way forward. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7700762" data-originallang="en">In fact, the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> has even said that nothing is off the table. The appointment of this special rapporteur means he will be able to look at those options to allow NSICOP and NSIRA to do their work, the work that PROC could put forward if we ever get down to talking about recommendations for this study. A special rapporteur could then say, “Here are the gaps. Here is where I think we should move forward or not”, etc., as an independent, impartial person. Something the Prime Minister acknowledges is that this debate is a fair and legitimate one.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700763" data-originallang="en">The point I would like to raise, though, is that's not the motion on the floor that we're debating. We're debating whether staffers should be invited to this committee to answer for the government. We heard that time and time again, and Mr. Julian from the NDP was the first to raise the fact that it was Conservatives, when they were in government, who, time and time again, rallied against bringing staffers forward and insisted on the idea of ministerial responsibility.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700764" data-originallang="en">We've had Ministers Joly and LeBlanc twice. We have opportunities to invite others, if that's the will of the committee, but that's not what this is. We're not debating, as I mentioned before, whether we bring in additional witnesses to look at how European Union countries are dealing with this or how Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. are dealing with foreign interference. We're not debating how to get the best information; we're debating bringing on one particular staffer, the Prime Minister's chief of staff, which is who the Conservatives seem to be most fixated on. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7700765" data-originallang="en">While I sit here and listen to the argument for or against the public inquiry, that's not what we're voting on.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700766" data-originallang="en"> Given the fact that this motion is about bringing in the chief of staff to the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, the motion, by its very nature, is purely partisan. That's what we're debating here today. What I find so egregious is that we are not using committee time to move forward in the study, which we have all said is important. We have extended the study. We've agreed to additional witnesses and to bringing ministers back as new information becomes available. We've put forward ideas. Even the foreign registry was something this committee was starting to talk about. There are lots of opportunities to discuss various things dealing with the very serious issue of foreign interference. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7700767" data-originallang="en">That is not what's preoccupied this committee today or on the other days we've been talking. The discussion has been purely partisan, and that's what my comments are going to be reflecting, because it's the partisan nature of the motion that I find not helpful to Canadians. I don't find it helpful in dealing with foreign interference when there are opportunities for NSICOP and NSIRA and for a special rapporteur to look at all of the information and, if anything is sensitive in nature, to treat it through NSICOP in a manner that handles national security with the care and sensitivity it deserves, something that PROC just frankly can't do. As much as Conservatives have time and time again tried to access national security documents or tried to make them public, luckily cooler heads have prevailed on national security and the security those documents deserve has been taken into account.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700768" data-originallang="en">I'll go back to the partisanship that is really what all of this is about. For any Canadians watching, make no mistake—that's really what this is. It is a motion to try to get the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>'s chief of staff to come in, to try to get some clickbait for Conservatives and their followers. It's not about making democracy stronger. It's not about protecting from foreign interference in future elections. If it were, we'd have serious witnesses in to deal with, as I said, how other countries are dealing with this and how we are going to move forward in protecting our institutions to make sure they maintain the level of strength that they have had up to date.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700769" data-originallang="en">The national security community has confirmed for us time and time again that it was Canadians and Canadians alone who determined the outcome of the 2019 and 2021 elections, but we have to continue to be diligent with that. We can't take that for granted, and so there is an opportunity for this committee to do that work and to make recommendations. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7700770" data-originallang="en">The threats around foreign interference and how foreign state actors engage in it are constantly changing, so what we are talking about today versus even five years from now could be totally different, and a future PROC committee could be seized with this issue and with how to change and adapt once again, but again, that's not what we're discussing. We're not discussing the forms of foreign interference. We're discussing one particular staffer the Conservatives are hell-bent on having appear on an issue of national security when they know that in a public forum there will be limitations on any sort of testimony that deals with national security. It would be irresponsible for someone to come forward and share national security information in a public manner. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7700771" data-originallang="en">I don't know what the Conservatives' ultimate goal is. I think it's just clickbait. Is it to try to release national security information? I don't understand why they think that would be a good idea for Canada or for Canadians or for the security of this country, but I don't try to or pretend to get into the heads of Conservative strategists, because I think those would be very dark and scary places.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700772" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, that being said, with respect to the issues around partisanship, I want to get back to something that the leader of the official opposition said to <a data-HoCid="278920" href="/politicians/dominic-leblanc/" title="Dominic LeBlanc">Minister LeBlanc</a> during question period when we asked why the Conservatives, when the leader of the official opposition was the Minister of Democratic Reform, opted to do nothing about foreign interference issues when he was the minister responsible, even though there had been warnings from the national security community during the Harper government. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7700773" data-originallang="en"> His response was—I'm paraphrasing here—that there was no partisan reason or advantage for them to do anything about it. I think that says it there about what all of this is about. The Conservatives seem to take national security and foreign interference seriously when they believe there is some sort of partisan benefit for themselves.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700774" data-originallang="en">I want to dig deeper into this partisan rabbit hole that the Conservatives have been doing down for a number of years because, interestingly enough, it was actually Mr. O'Toole who first claimed that there was some sort of foreign interference after the 2021 election, and it was Conservatives who said no, that wasn't true.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700775" data-originallang="en"> In fact, a Conservative senator had to apologize to Mr. Hsu for calling him a liar over the issue of foreign interference. In 2021, Erin O'Toole was talking about how he lost eight ridings, and then it changed to nine ridings, and then 13 ridings, and they blamed foreign interference. Then Mr. Hsu said no, it was Conservatives and Erin O'Toole's stance. This is all documented in media reporting. What's so interesting to watch about this is that going back at least a year, if not two, there has been this infighting among Conservatives about the Erin O'Toole campaign strategy, and there were talks about how there was a whole press conference held by a group of Chinese-Canadian Conservatives who called on Erin O'Toole to step down as leader because they said—I'm reading here from an article about it—the reason for the loss in the 2021 election was that there was a shift towards the centre politically, a lack of outreach to the Chinese-Canadian voters and a failure to embrace Peter MacKay, who lost the Tories' last leadership race to O'Toole. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7700776" data-originallang="en">There was this feeling amongst even Chinese-Canadian Conservative members and politicians from Toronto, from B.C., who actually held a press conference asking for Mr. O'Toole to resign because they felt he did such a poor job of engaging with Chinese-Canadian members of the community that they didn't want him as leader anymore and they felt that as Chinese Canadians, they had a hard time within these communities to sell their Conservative message. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7700777" data-originallang="en"> I find it interesting after all this—and again, this is all documented online—that now the Conservatives are coming out and saying no, no, no, it wasn't their messaging with the Chinese-Canadian community and it wasn't Erin O'Toole's failed leadership. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7700778" data-originallang="en">By the way, I would also like to point out that in B.C., part of the time when Mr. Hsu had been talking about seeing a decline in support in the election was also the time Erin O'Toole flip-flopped on gun control, which is a very important issue in many communities but it's significant in the greater Vancouver area as well.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700779" data-originallang="en">The Conservatives, including Mr. Hsu, have changed their positions on whether it was Erin O'Toole's lack of leadership, and now you have Conservatives saying no, it's absolutely the result of foreign interference. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7700780" data-originallang="en"> We actually had the non-partisan national security community testify before this committee a couple of weeks ago. They confirmed that although they saw a lot of chatter against the Conservatives, especially in the Chinese diaspora community, they couldn't determine that it was actually foreign state-based.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700781" data-originallang="en">Why that's so important is that there can be groups, whether it's seniors, the Chinese community—as in this case—different diaspora groups or groups of individuals. Young people can come together and start campaigns on political issues that they don't agree with. It doesn't matter their cultural background, their religious beliefs or how they identify as a group; they are Canadians, and that's a Canadian-based, normal political activity.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700782" data-originallang="en">We heard testimony that they could not find evidence that the increase in chatter or communications against the Conservative Party was foreign-based. It's not to say that foreign interference isn't real or that it wasn't attempted, but I think that if you're going to claim that a particular election was won or lost based on foreign interference, you really need to be able to back that up. That's a pretty serious accusation. It would be a very serious failing of our institutions. I don't think you can just say that without clear evidence. That's something that the national security community, who are non-partisan professionals, demonstrated: They couldn't find that connection to a foreign state.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700783" data-originallang="en">I think that's really important, because making those accusations without being able to back them up undermines Canadians' trust in our institutions. If our institutions are failing, then we have to deal with that, but you can't just make that claim without evidence and create this fear.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700784" data-originallang="en">I'll bring up an example of another kind of base of misinformation, and it was Canadian-based. A group of Conservatives got together in the last election and the 2019 election as well. I received their misinformation in my riding and I think Mr. Turnbull probably did in his as well. They sent mail to every single household in our ridings saying that a Liberal government was going to tax your primary residence. It wasn't true. The<a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau"> Prime Minister</a> and the <a data-HoCid="278914" href="/politicians/ahmed-hussen/" title="Ahmed Hussen">Minister of Housing</a> had debunked it many times. It was an organized, coordinated effort to mislead and to create a political outcome.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700785" data-originallang="en">Nobody said that it came from Russia. Nobody said that coordinated and targeted misinformation campaign came from China. That's a form of politics that I think most Canadians find really disappointing. It creates confusion. It might change some votes. It certainly causes local elections to have to quickly pivot and make sure that they are answering those questions and clarifying what the real position of the party is. Those things do happen.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700786" data-originallang="en">I don't think there's any doubt that there were serious concerns from certain communities that were upset with the Conservative policies and agendas. As I said, there were Chinese-Canadian Conservative members who came out and said very clearly that <a data-HoCid="278509" href="/politicians/erin-otoole/" title="Erin O'Toole">Erin O'Toole</a> failed to connect with the Chinese-Canadian community. If those members of the community shared information and Conservative policies that they were upset about, that's exactly what our national security community was alluding to when they testified. It was that there are campaigns locally, or Canadian-driven information sharing, in which many politicians, depending on where they stand or what their position is, may say, “Hey, that's not our position.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700787" data-originallang="en"> It's just like when Conservatives or Canada Proud put out stuff or the Canadian gun lobby puts out misleading information. It's not pleasant to deal with, especially when you know it's not true in a local campaign, but those are Canadians expressing their views. I find it a bit rich that now the Conservatives—who can be some of the worst, I find, at putting this disinformation into local campaigns—are now, without evidence, suggesting that a similar sharing of displeasure towards <a data-HoCid="278509" href="/politicians/erin-otoole/" title="Erin O'Toole">Erin O'Toole</a> and the Conservative policies of the time is now somehow not okay.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700788" data-originallang="en">It wouldn't be okay if that were directly related to a foreign state action, full stop, but the national security community that monitors this was before our committee and saying that they couldn't make that connection. It's not the Liberals saying that. It's not the NDP, it's not the Bloc and it's not the Conservatives: It's the national security community saying that they couldn't make that connection.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700789" data-originallang="en">It also reminds me of when the Conservatives in 2015 started the cultural barbaric practices hotline. Well, that really motivated the Muslim community across Canada to be outraged and organized—all very legitimate things to be upset about—and to organize against local Conservatives because those policies were outrageous. Again, that's part of the democratic process that the national security community does not engage, as long as they can't determine that it's foreign state-based. That is the sort of political discourse, whether you like it or not, in which communities can come together and say, “We don't like the direction of this policy or whatnot, and it impacts us.” Conservatives came together to oust <a data-HoCid="278509" href="/politicians/erin-otoole/" title="Erin O'Toole">Erin O'Toole</a> because they didn't like the direction of his policies.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700790" data-originallang="en">I have actually sat in question period and watched as Liberals pointed out that the Conservatives actually ran on a platform of pricing pollution and I watched how many members on the Conservative benches said, “I didn't, I didn't”, but you literally run on a platform, under the way the party system works, and the Conservatives literally ran on a platform of pricing pollution. Because now they don't like it and they got rid of that leader, they say, “No, I didn't; I didn't.” Members of the Conservative Party are disavowing their own platform from the last election, but yet they're surprised that maybe voters also disavowed their policy platform. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7700791" data-originallang="en">That's the partisan stuff that's really underneath all of this, because I think it's not about foreign interference for the Conservative Party. If it was, they would have been talking about it, as I said, in 2019 when NSICOP first tabled this report in the House of Commons. They didn't. They didn't talk about foreign interference then. They didn't talk about it in 2020 or 2021. It was in 2022 when I guess they started to wake up to the issue because they felt the partisan reasons for doing so now made sense, based on the <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">Leader of the Opposition</a>, who clearly demonstrated that until it was going to make partisan sense for them, they weren't really interested in the issues of foreign interference.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700792" data-originallang="en">I also want to bring up now.... Again, if I thought this motion was about the merits or how we're going to move forward in dealing with the issues of foreign interference or what the best next steps are or what the recommendations are that are going to come out of this committee, I'd be talking about those, but since this is a purely partisan exercise to bring in partisan staffers instead of the ministers responsible, I'm going to continue to talk about the partisan nature and the partisan hypocrisy coming from the Conservative Party.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700793" data-originallang="en"> What I find interesting is that once again the Conservatives have woken up to foreign interference just now, even though it's something we've been really focused on and thinking about. It's funny, because when the SITE committee was created before the 2019 election and the critical election task force was in place for the 2019 and 2021 elections, I find it interesting that I didn't see any Conservatives raising their hands and saying, “Hey, what is this? Let's have some more scrutiny on this. Are there better recommendations for how these groups could operate?” No. They showed up to the foreign interference and the national security briefings and they didn't raise any flags there either. They took the briefings. They were fine moving forward with that process. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7700794" data-originallang="en">They didn't raise any issues in the past about how this structure existed. They didn't bring forward recommendations back then on how to deal with foreign interference either. Why now? Why are Conservatives only caring now? Well, it's because they think there is a partisan reason to do so. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7700795" data-originallang="en">It reminds me of the U.S., with then President Trump and the slow undermining of election results and political institutions. It started slowly with Republicans in the U.S.—not all Republicans, but certain Trump Republicans, I would say—undermining voting rights. One thing that the current <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">Leader of the Opposition</a>, formerly the democratic institutions minister, did was to just make it harder for Canadians to vote. We see those mirrors in the U.S. We see the “stop the steal” rhetoric out of the U.S., and then we start to see Conservatives here using similar language. I saw Mr. Cooper talking about collusion. Where is this language coming from, talking about “corrupt”, about how there's something to hide, suggesting that the elections were not determined by Canadians? Is it from our neighbours to the south? </p>
<p data-HoCid="7700796" data-originallang="en"> Then, when they're directly asked—because I think Conservatives must have done some polling, or they know that being too closely aligned with Trump-style politics is probably not very favourable in this country—they say, “No, no, no; we trust the results of the election, but we think there was collusion. We think the Liberals are in partnership with China. We have no proof of that, but we'd just like to sow doubt in Canadians' minds.” </p>
<p data-HoCid="7700797" data-originallang="en">They're doing a good job, actually, of sowing doubt, but only among their own voters. I saw a poll today that said 48% of Conservatives think the election outcomes were not determined by Canadians. For Liberal voters, it was 7%. You're seeing an erosion in Conservative voters of the trust in our democratic institutions. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7700798" data-originallang="en">We watched that same erosion in the U.S. and then what eventually happened there. When you start building this vacuum of mistrust in our institutions, what happens is that a group of people will really believe that the democratic process is no longer fair and free. When confirmation or proof doesn't exist to back those things up, you start to think it's a giant conspiracy. When that vacuum of concern and anger has nowhere to go, look at what happened on January 6 in the U.S. A group of people just couldn't believe that the outcome of the U.S. election was what it was.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700799" data-originallang="en"> That's a dangerous game, going down this road. It's not to say that dealing with foreign interference isn't something that should be done—it absolutely is—but creating this mistrust without evidence is what the dangerous game is. It's not just in the U.S. We've seen it in other countries. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7700800" data-originallang="en">When we see numbers like 48% of Conservatives don't think the outcome of the election was free and fair, that is when every single Canadian should be concerned. There has not been an impartial, non-partisan person through Elections Canada, the national security community or CSIS.... Nobody in those impartial circles has said there's evidence to suggest that it wasn't Canadians who determined the outcome of our elections. Stoking this misinformation and disinformation means we are seeing that certain groups no longer believe the impartiality of our public service.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700801" data-originallang="en">We saw that in the U.S. We saw how that played out. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7700802" data-originallang="en">While Conservatives might think this is funny clickbait or that this is fun and games, look at those numbers. Look at the base. I mean, look at Twitter—not that I think that's a very reliable source of information. Look at the extreme hate on this issue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700803" data-originallang="en">I was part of the group of parliamentarians who were actually banned from China, with Conservative <a data-HoCid="278408" href="/politicians/michael-chong/" title="Michael Chong">Michael Chong</a>. It was the same round. I was banned from China because I was on the study that condemned the treatment of Uighurs. I actually voted in favour of the Conservative motion to ban Huawei. I have made known my concerns and my positions on things. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7700804" data-originallang="en">By the way, being banned by China is a point of pride. I have absolutely no issue with that. I stand firmly in my stance on the treatment of Uighurs and how deplorable that is.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700805" data-originallang="en">After all of this, there are calls that I'm an agent of China. The most ridiculous things are said because facts don't matter in this world anymore. Those are the dangerous games that.... </p>
<p data-HoCid="7700806" data-originallang="en">As politicians, we can't control what goes out on social media. We can't control what is amplified by certain groups that think it's beneficial. What we can control is how we behave. In saying things like “collusion”, we know exactly what that dog whistle is because we've seen it. We've seen it play out. We've seen the violence play out.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700807" data-originallang="en">Then we see that trend continue. We talk about the convoy that came to Ottawa. If the Conservatives were consistent in their outrage over foreign interference, then why was there no condemnation of the widely reported foreign funding for the convoy? I didn't see the members of the Conservative Party, who stood proudly with convoy members, say that this is a great movement, but no foreign funding, please; let's keep this Canadian. No, of course not. They didn't want to upset this angry base that they could tap into.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700808" data-originallang="en">The funding of that convoy, for example, would never have actually passed Elections Canada election financing rules. It's interesting that I don't see condemnation for that behaviour, which wouldn't have passed the test for our own election rules and our financing rules. Conservatives seem to be silent on that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700809" data-originallang="en"> The other partisan piece of this, once again, is that if Conservatives were truly worried about foreign interference in the Canadian democratic process, then why have I not seen any of the members sitting around here in the House condemn the Conservative caucus members who met with Christine Anderson, the far-right European Union politician who met with Dean Allison, Colin Carrie and Leslyn Lewis?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700810" data-originallang="en">Ms. Anderson has been known for spreading anti-immigrant hate and anti-Muslim ideology. She has publicly tried to downplay Nazi crimes and the Holocaust. Her party, the Alternative for Germany Party, is under surveillance as an extremist group.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700811" data-originallang="en">Why is it that when foreign state actors and foreign extremist groups come to Canada and share their political hate and views, the Conservatives are okay with that? If you really want to get to the bottom of foreign interference and ensure that misinformation and disinformation from foreign actors are not welcomed in this country, where's the condemnation for an alt-right hate group coming to Canada and meeting with Conservative members? Is it because Conservatives share those values that it's okay? I sure hope not.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700812" data-originallang="en">I have a lot Muslim friends and neighbours in my community, and to see some of the hatred and vitriol coming from that party and to see it embraced here by Canadian Conservative members scares me. I have sat with members of my Muslim community when there have been attacks against Muslims in Canada and around the world. I've seen the fear they have. To see that hate embraced once again by the Conservative Party of Canada scares me for them. It scares me for our Jewish community. We are seeing anti-Semitism on the rise. To see that a person, a foreign actor, with these hateful views being embraced by the Conservative Party of Canada.... Why are we not calling that out? Well, we are. Why are the Conservatives not calling that out? I think there's an opportunity here. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7700813" data-originallang="en">By the way, CSIS has raised the alarm bells on alt-right hate groups for many years, domestic and foreign. If the Conservatives are going to say, “Well, we're talking about China right now, and foreign interference and what CSIS is reporting”, I can tell you that CSIS has raised the alarm bells on alt-right hate, domestic and foreign, and the Conservatives sit here and embrace a member of a foreign state who's under surveillance for extremist views.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700814" data-originallang="en"> I don't know how any member of the Conservative Party sits in this place and thinks that there isn't a giant hypocrisy in their positions. How can they let that go unchallenged? How can they let that meeting go unchallenged? One of the members who met still sits in the Conservative front benches. How can the Conservatives can sit here and say that they are solely focused on standing up for Canadian democracy when they themselves, within their own party, are welcoming extremist hate groups that are under surveillance from foreign states? It only suits the Conservatives to stand up for something if they feel there's some partisan advantage.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700815" data-originallang="en">It was interesting that <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">Pierre Poilievre</a>, the leader of the Conservative Party, condemned the views of Christine Anderson in a statement, but he didn't share it on his social media channels. Why was that? It's interesting.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700816" data-originallang="en">Why was it that when he was asked, once the House resumed, if he'd be condemning those three members who met with her, he all of a sudden walked back his comments about how vile her views were? How do you think members of the Jewish or Muslim communities feel about his no longer calling her views vile?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700817" data-originallang="en">I guess it shouldn't be a surprise from a party and from a leader who bury misogynistic hashtags in their social media views. This hate and mistrust in our democratic systems don't fulfill the goals of the Conservative Party these days. It's sad to watch. It's like watching the Republicans in the U.S.—I have never really shared Republican views—seeing members in their own party trying to get back to their morals and values and to get off this hate-filled mission, and I know there are probably members of the Conservative Party who feel very uncomfortable with this alt-right, hate-filled turn. We need them to stand up, frankly.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700818" data-originallang="en">I keep going back to the 48% of Conservative voters who think that Canadians didn't steer the outcome of these elections. I'd be curious to see what their viewpoint was just a year ago or six months ago, before all of the Conservative rhetoric started spiking and going crazy. There seems to be, as <a data-HoCid="291215" href="/politicians/pierre-poilievre/" title="Pierre Poilievre">Mr. Poilievre</a> has said, a partisan advantage to it. There wasn't a partisan advantage to doing anything about foreign interference in the past.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700819" data-originallang="en">I think it's incredibly scary to see the partisan nature of this motion that we're debating. We're not getting to the work of actual recommendations on how to protect our democratic institutions from foreign interference. We're not making those recommendations. We've been debating.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700820" data-originallang="en">Conservatives will complain about how many hours we've been talking. We've not been talking about the merits of one recommendation over the other. We've been talking because Conservatives want to turn this into—as they do—a partisan hit job. They want nothing more than clickbait. If they were serious about getting to the bottom of this, we'd be talking about how we're moving forward, the recommendations that PROC could make, things we'd want to see with a special rapporteur, and how PROC can inform that process with our own recommendations, because we had started this work previously. We're not doing any of that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700821" data-originallang="en">As I said, Conservatives are focused solely on partisan points. If they weren't, then they'd be dealing with all of the things I already spoke about, like condemning Christine Anderson and the MPs who met with her for her vile views and her rhetoric as a foreign actor who's under surveillance since her party is an extremist group. The Conservatives would not be stirring up rhetoric about collusion and elections being stolen. It's only a matter of time, I feel, before the Conservatives are going to do their own “stop the steal” campaign. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7700822" data-originallang="en"> They're ramping up their rhetoric to the point where 48% of Conservative voters have lost trust in democratic institutions. It's going to be really hard to undo it once you let that genie out of the bottle. As I said, look at January 6 and what happened in the U.S. and think very clearly before you start using rhetoric without being able to back it up with evidence.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700823" data-originallang="en">I've talked about how Mr. O'Toole, as leader, was asked to step down by his own Chinese-Canadian Conservative caucus members or party members because of his lack of connection with the Chinese-Canadian community, and how those things seem to be completely under the radar now. Actually, Mr. Julian raised it numerous times too. The Conservatives, in their talking points, never seem to mention the media reporting that it was actually Conservative members who were identified as well.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700824" data-originallang="en">I'm not going down the road of “Let's play that game”, but the point is that I find it interesting. The Conservatives stand on their soapboxes to say they're just trying to get to the bottom of it, but they leave out the fact that they too were named in all of this. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7700825" data-originallang="en">Again, if it was a genuine concern for democracy, a genuine concern for standing up for what's right, then why aren't they standing up for everything that's right? That's the problem I have with this motion. That's why, despite Mr. Barrett's uncomfortableness or feeling he's heard everything he needs to hear and there's nothing left to say, I'm going to keep using my voice, because there is such a hypocrisy. What's coming from the Conservative Party is so partisan that I can't sit here and pretend the motion that is being discussed is some way to improve our democratic institutions. If the Conservatives were genuinely concerned, they would have raised all the issues, all the things that were mentioned in the reporting, such as the accusations about their own party members. They would have raised the issues of Mr. O'Toole, and, again, the fact their own caucus abandoned the platform he ran on, but they seem to think that Canadians didn't. I find that to be the most interesting. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7700826" data-originallang="en">As well, there's the fact they don't even condemn foreign funding that wouldn't be acceptable under our Canada Elections Act and they don't condemn alt-right foreign actors coming to Canada to spread misinformation and hate. Until the Conservatives come to terms with their own hypocrisy and at least are honest with Canadians that this is nothing more than a partisan issue, then yes, I'm going to keep using my voice to highlight all of the hypocrisy and all of the ways we could be actually working to make our democratic institutions stronger. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7700827" data-originallang="en">I'm also going to continue to shine a light.... What is it that Mr. Cooper loves to say? Shine a light. Transparency. Sunshine. I am going to be the sunshine shining a light on the Conservative hypocrisy, the Conservative inability to condemn the foreign interference that seems to be happening within their own caucus and the inability to stand up for our Jewish communities here, for our Muslim communities, and condemn that vile rhetoric instead of welcoming those members with open arms.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700828" data-originallang="en">Yes, I'm going to continue to shine a spotlight. I'm going to use a voice on Conservative hypocrisy, on the partisan nature of the road they've taken us down. When they are ready to deal with the real work of protecting our democratic institutions from foreign interference, I'll be right there, ready and willing to work.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7700829" data-originallang="en"> Madam Chair, I think I'll leave it there for now. I look forward to hearing the rest of the debate.</p>
