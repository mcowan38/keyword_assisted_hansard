<p data-HoCid="8071642" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much for the testimony.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8071643" data-originallang="en">Mr. Jenkins, I'm going to ask this one of you, because you were just answering my colleague with regard to that intersectionality of impacts and how they compound.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8071644" data-originallang="en"> Working from those who are most impacted, I agree with Mr. Trudel. We are seeing a situation in the world right now where the conflicts in Gaza are disproportionately hurting children. We know that the population in Palestine is over 50% children. Afghanistan has that particular complexity of the impacts on women and girls. I can only imagine the impacts on women and girls who are trying to access inclusive education in Ukraine, a situation where we are also looking at conflict.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8071645" data-originallang="en">I wanted to give you another moment to talk a little bit about the compoundedness of the impacts and perhaps layer on how we have not recovered from some of those impacts with what has happened with COVID over the last several years. Could you talk about that a little bit for me, Mr. Jenkins?</p>
