<p data-HoCid="7178586" data-originallang="fr"> I thank Mr. Albas for his comments.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7178587" data-originallang="fr">As I have said before, at the moment I am against setting a limit on the committee consideration of this bill. However, this could be the subject of a second amendment.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7178588" data-originallang="fr">With respect to this amendment, I suggest in it that different committees share the work, so that we can properly study the whole bill.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7178589" data-originallang="fr">So I propose that division 9 of part 5 be assigned to the Standing Committee on International Trade. This division amends the Special Import Measures Act. Thus, we must ensure that the legislation does not have perverse effects on the act for the industrial sectors of Quebec and Canada and that all possible effects are fully studied. If it were the Standing Committee on Finance studying this division, it would have to spend a lot of time on it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7178590" data-originallang="fr"> I also propose that divisions 15, 16 and 17 of part 5 be referred to the Standing Committee on Industry and Technology. Division 15 deals with amending the Competition Act. We know that the Competition Act is very weak in Canada, the weakest in the G7. I welcome the government's intention to amend it, but is what is being proposed enough to really change the game?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7178591" data-originallang="fr">Then I propose that division 16 of part 5, which deals with the Copyright Act, be referred to the Standing Committee on Industry and Technology. This is the committee that has the expertise to extend the term of copyright. It could also study division 17 of part 5, which deals with the College of Patent Agents and Trademark Agents Act. In my view, this would save us several sittings.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7178592" data-originallang="fr">The Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities would be assigned all the divisions of part 5 that deal with employment insurance and paid leave. These include divisions 26 and 27, which amend the Employment Insurance Act, and division 29, which amends the Criminal Code and the Canada Labour Code to reduce the time limit for medical leave, and so on. The latter does not deal directly with employment insurance, but with paid leave days. There is also division 32, which establishes the Employment Insurance Board of Appeal.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7178593" data-originallang="fr"> In my view, the study of these divisions represents several weeks of work and will require several witnesses, as well as a great deal of expertise and study.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7178594" data-originallang="fr">Then I propose that division 23 of part 5, which amends the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, be referred to the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration. The Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration has a great deal of expertise in this area and it would save us time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7178595" data-originallang="fr">Finally, I propose that divisions 18, 19, 21 and 22 of part 5 be referred to the Standing Committee on Justice. Division 18 deals with the Civil Lunar Gateway Agreement Implementation Act. The implications of this division of the bill are the responsibility of the Standing Committee on Justice. Division 19 amends the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. In my opinion, the Standing Committee on Finance does not have the expertise to deal with body cavity x-rays, far from it, as I have already mentioned.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7178596" data-originallang="fr">Division 21 of part 5 amends the Criminal Code to create the offence of wilfully promoting antisemitism. I believe that this division falls under the purview of the Standing Committee on Justice, as does division 22, which amends the Judges Act, the Federal Courts Act and the Tax Court of Canada Act and certain other acts.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7178597" data-originallang="fr"> So that is my motion. I hope I have answered my colleague Mr. Albas' question correctly.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7178598" data-originallang="fr">Thank you.</p>
