<p data-HoCid="6112253" data-originallang="en">I want to address a question that many Canadians and people around the world are worried about: what we see as the relentless advances of settlements in the occupied territories in the Middle East. Canada, of course, supports a two-state solution. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6112254" data-originallang="en">I really have two questions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6112255" data-originallang="en">It's not easy, and I think you'd say that we support international human rights even when it's not easy. This is a situation that has been going on for many years, and some fear that it's going to go on for many more and that there will finally be no way to get out of it. What do you have to say about that in terms of Canada's efforts and position, and what is Canada doing to advance the two-state solution that it has put forth for the last many years?</p>
