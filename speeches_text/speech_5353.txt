<p data-HoCid="8669654">Mr. Speaker, with respect to the above question, what follows is the response from the Canada Revenue Agency, CRA, as of September 17, 2024, the date of question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8669655">The CRA is committed to increasing the transparency and accountability of charitable organizations by providing relevant information about them to the public, in accordance with the disclosure provisions of the Income Tax Act, or the act.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8669656">The confidentiality provisions of the act prevent the CRA from commenting on specific cases without the consent of an authorized representative of the organization. However, as an exception to the general rules around taxpayer confidentiality, the act allows for certain information about registered and revoked charities to be released to the public. The CRA’s legal authority for the public disclosure of that information is found in subsections 149.1(15) and 241(3.2) of the act. Any information or document that is not explicitly identified by those disclosure provisions cannot be provided to the public.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8669657">For further details on what information is publicly available, please see “How to get information about a charity” at https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/charities-giving/charities/information-about-a-charity.html.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8669658">As such, the information requested in this question is considered taxpayer information and cannot be provided without the consent of an authorized representative of the organization, that is, the Jewish National Fund. </p>
