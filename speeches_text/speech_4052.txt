<p data-HoCid="8396393" data-originallang="en">I want to address your question by going back to the relationship between Canada and UNRWA. It's a recognition of UNRWA's role in Gaza as well as in the region. UNRWA is responsible for the humanitarian response to two million Gazans and four million Palestinians in the region.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8396394" data-originallang="en"> We stopped pausing funding in recognition of two things. One was the tangible and numerous steps that UNRWA itself and the UN had taken to build confidence and put in more oversight and accountability measures that built the confidence of donor countries like Canada. Second, we also stopped pausing funding in recognition of the dire humanitarian situation on the ground. When you combine those two things, we were confident to move forward.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8396395" data-originallang="en">The responsibility of UNRWA to continue to implement those oversight and accountability mechanisms and to meet its obligations towards neutrality and anti-terrorism are ongoing. They're not just stuck in that time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8396396" data-originallang="en"> We will continue to monitor that, but we are very confident in the number of significant steps taken both by UNRWA, the UN and the Secretary General.</p>
