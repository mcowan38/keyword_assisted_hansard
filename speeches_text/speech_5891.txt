<p data-HoCid="8795004" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, as we stand on the threshold of this holy season, I want to wish all those celebrating in Don Valley West and around the world a very happy Christmas. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8795005" data-originallang="en">The promise of Christmas is that love can and will break through all of the cynicism, disappointment, pain and despair that continues to this day, long after Jesus walked the dusty roads of Palestine. Christmas did not happen just once. It happens every time someone lights a candle to make the way a little easier for another person. It happens every time someone welcomes a refugee or a broken person into their community. It happens every time we lift another person up, giving them more love, more hope and more success. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8795006" data-originallang="en">Christmas is a hard time for many. This Christmas welcome the stranger, feed the hungry, give hope to the lost. Let us make Christmas happen again.</p>
