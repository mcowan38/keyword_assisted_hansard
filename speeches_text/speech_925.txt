<p data-HoCid="6660643" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the minister engaging in debate. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6660644" data-originallang="en">In British Columbia, we have the highest recorded number of people with COVID-19 in our hospitals. People in Kelowna in long-term care, seniors who have received their first shot, are getting sick. Outbreaks are continuing. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6660645" data-originallang="en">By the way, there is a big difference between a benchmark and a target. This government has set targets that it is attempting to make. A benchmark is when we actually compare our targets with someone else's. I think that my constituents would say that the U.S., the U.K. and Israel have much different benchmarks than what this government considers.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6660646" data-originallang="en">At our borders we are seeing the transmission of variants from other countries. Once they have entered the country, community transmission becomes exponential. My point is this: Does this minister understand that, when she fails to get Canadians the supplies they need to fight this virus, she will not be able to catch up to the variants her government allowed into this country? Will she be accountable for that?</p>
