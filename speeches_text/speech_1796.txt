<p data-HoCid="7202430" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, Pitt Meadows is one of the prettiest spots on our planet and is a wonderful place to raise a family. It is on the traditional land of the Katzie, and is nestled between the coast mountains and the Pitt River and Fraser River. It has a small-town feel even though it is in metro Vancouver.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7202431" data-originallang="en">Residents enjoy chatting or strolling along the dikes, perhaps after grabbing a coffee at the Stomping Grounds Caf√© &amp; Bistroor an ice cream from the Sweet Tooth Creamery. If people are looking for a wonderful place to golf or to get married, there is nowhere better than Swaneset, which is not far from Pitt Lake, the largest freshwater tidal lake in the world, where people can view eagles, swans, herons and seals.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7202432" data-originallang="en">Business is booming. This month, a new airport terminal is opening, as well as a Vancouver aviation school. This Saturday, residents will line up by the thousands for Pitt Meadows' 81st annual parade. It is a great time to connect and it will be a blast.</p>
