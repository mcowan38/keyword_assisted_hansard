<p data-HoCid="7971412" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, The Wall Street Journal revealed today that mere weeks before Hamas terrorists unleashed the worst attack on Jews since the Holocaust, they went to Iran to take training and direction from a terrorist group, the IRGC. Strangely, given that this group is probably the most dangerous terrorist outfit on earth, it is perfectly legal to raise money for it and organize and recruit for it right here in Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7971413" data-originallang="en">Will the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> ban the IRGC today?</p>
