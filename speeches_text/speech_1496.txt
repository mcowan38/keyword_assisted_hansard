<p data-HoCid="6967470" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, interestingly enough, the member knows very well that my party, the members on our side of the aisle, have condemned those acts of hate or the flying of swastikas, but she chooses to participate in the same tactics as the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, which is to divide, attack and be punitive. It is absolutely disgusting. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6967471" data-originallang="en">What we are talking about right now is invoking the Emergencies Act in the country of Canada, an act the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> will use in order to go after individuals who disagree with his viewpoints.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6967472" data-originallang="en"> Why does the member not ask the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> to apologize to the member on our side, who was accused of marching with a swastika, when she herself is a young Jewish woman? That is disgusting. I would urge the member to call out the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> on that bad behaviour.</p>
