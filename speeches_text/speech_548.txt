<p data-HoCid="6477610" data-originallang="en">As far as air traffic services are concerned, I can't quite comment on that. Any types of cuts you're looking at will obviously, for the passengers and the surrounding people, slow it down. Our concern is more for the employees. It's not just the members that local 2228 represents, but all employees of Nav Canada. When they do cut jobs from any area, we're looking at the safety of not just the flying public and the other public, but also the employees. We're talking about fatigue management. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6477611" data-originallang="en">The company and everyone else will be looking at a certain level of service. Nav Canada pre-pandemic was understaffed. The previous CEO said publicly, a year or so ago, that they were ramping back up to try to get close to 100% staffing. Well, now they've laid staff off, so now you're even further down that rabbit hole. They were more than willing to pay overtime to people to make up those levels of service. That's probably what's going to happen again. You're looking at fatigue management in just about every sector of Nav Canada, so that safety will take a hit.</p>
