<p data-HoCid="8693888" data-originallang="en"> Professor Musu, you've expressed support for a two-state solution. You've also indicated some nuance that it may not be constructive for the Government of Canada to immediately recognize the State of Palestine. Could you talk a bit more about the conditions you think should be placed on the recognition of a State of Palestine in the current context?</p>
