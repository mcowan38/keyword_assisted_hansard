<p data-HoCid="7347835" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, for over a month, the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>'s Office knew the public rantings of a known anti-Semite and then continued to fund him until he was caught. This is not incompetence, it is purposeful and condones the very real and growing anti-Semitism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7347836" data-originallang="en"> The <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, the <a data-HoCid="278929" href="/politicians/pablo-rodriguez/" title="Pablo Rodriguez">Minister of Canadian Heritage</a> and the <a data-HoCid="278914" href="/politicians/ahmed-hussen/" title="Ahmed Hussen">Minister of Housing and Diversity and Inclusion</a> knew. They knew for a month and they did nothing. It is hard to imagine a month of silence of hate-fuelled bigotry against any other group in our country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7347837" data-originallang="en">Who else knew and why is no one on the other side being held accountable for promoting hate with Canadian tax dollars?</p>
