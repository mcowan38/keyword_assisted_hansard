<p data-HoCid="6055673" data-originallang="en"> Ms. Gazan, I'm going to need a minute to consult with the procedural clerks on this, because a motion on this very subject was presented and adopted during routine motions. Give me a minute, please. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6055674" data-originallang="en">Thank you, colleagues, for your indulgence. My advice on this is that, given that earlier in the meeting a motion was passed with respect to proceeding with a meeting without a quorum, in order to be able to entertain Ms. Gazan's motion, unanimous consent would be required to withdraw the first motion so as to consider hers. Do we have unanimous consent to withdraw the previous motion with respect to meeting without a quorum?</p>
