<p data-HoCid="7774078" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7774079" data-originallang="en">Thank you again, Minister, for being here with us.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7774080" data-originallang="en">Minister, I think you probably know that I've put forward a motion at this committee to conduct a comprehensive study on the actions that Canada should take to foster peace and respect for human rights and international law in Israel and Palestine. I think we can all agree that recent events have made it very clear that Canada's foreign policy towards the Middle East is not working and needs some serious review.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7774081" data-originallang="en">Will your government be supporting that study?</p>
