<p data-HoCid="8520200" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8520201" data-originallang="fr">Thank you for being with us this morning, Mr. Dolhai.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8520202" data-originallang="fr">I'm going to pick up where Mr. Mendicino left off. In recent weeks, the committee has indeed heard from people on the issue of anti-Semitism in Canada. We then heard from people on the issue of Islamophobia. Had we wanted to keep studying those issues, we would have heard about all manner of situations fuelled by hate. It's something we have to deal with. Just this week, the RCMP reported an increase in hate crimes in Canada yet again and questioned whether it had all the tools the crisis demands.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8520203" data-originallang="fr">I'd like to hear your thoughts on that. As I understand it, you have quite a bit of leadership experience at the Public Prosecution Service of Canada, first as deputy director and then as acting director. In your view, does the PPSC currently have the tools it needs to address the rise in hate crimes? If not, what tools does it need?</p>
