<p data-HoCid="8249277" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, it is always very difficult to speak after the member for <a data-HoCid="278704" href="/politicians/lori-idlout/" title="Lori Idlout">Nunavut</a> because she is such a force within our caucus and such a champion for the people she represents. It is an honour to be in a caucus with her.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8249278" data-originallang="en">Today, we are talking about Bill <a data-HoCid="12138647" href="/bills/44-1/C-35/" title="An Act respecting early learning and child care in Canada">C-35</a> and the amendments that have been brought forward. I want to start by talking about just how vital child care is in our country and what a fundamental thing it is to provide real child care across the country in an affordable way that women and families can access.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8249279" data-originallang="en">During COVID-19, I worked with the member for <a data-HoCid="278641" href="/politicians/charlie-angus/" title="Charlie Angus">Timmins—James Bay</a> to look at ways that we could have an economic recovery after the slowdown that happened during COVID. One of the things we heard constantly, whether it be from financial institutions, chambers of commerce, or labour groups, was the need for child care and the importance of it, that child care was the best thing we could do for economic recovery.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8249280" data-originallang="en">That is one piece of it, but I am a woman and I have children. I remember the struggle of finding child care. I remember how difficult it was to find quality child care, to be able to afford quality child care, to ensure that my children were cared for so I could return to the work force. I know for so many women across the country that this was not possible.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8249281" data-originallang="en">Having child care come forward after so many years makes me think of people like Irene Mathyssen, who pushed so hard for child care. I think about the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> who has been absolutely tireless in this fight for child care for women. I think about these champions within the labour movement who have moved this forward over decades and decades. The fact that we now are here and have this program in place is fundamental.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8249282" data-originallang="en">I am not going to lie. This is not a perfect program. We have heard from labour leaders who say we need a workforce strategy to go along with this program. We need to ensure that the workers who are working in child care centres are adequately paid, are adequately trained and are given the resources they need so that child care spaces are available. There is a lot of work to continue to do. The idea of getting child care to people is fundamental.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8249283" data-originallang="en"> The New Democrats have always known how important child care is. It is why, in my province of Alberta, Rachel Notley was the first premier to pilot a $25-a-day child care. It was wildly successful, but, of course, the Conservatives were elected under Jason Kenney and they cut that. Right now, the premiers of B.C. and Manitoba, again, New Democratic premiers, are championing and prioritizing the $10-a-day child care. Therefore, Canadians in those provinces will have that program in place.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8249284" data-originallang="en">Of course, the Conservatives in my province have, once again, fumbled the ball. As we all know, Danielle Smith would rather pick a fight with the federal government—</p>
