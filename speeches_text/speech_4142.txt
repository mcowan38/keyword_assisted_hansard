<p data-HoCid="8406252" data-originallang="en"> Two years ago, long before October 7, when I was the president of Hillel at Concordia, I had been sharing a lot about my activism and the activities we were doing at Hillel on campus, and I posted that we were going to be there at a table in the Hall building. This was two years before October 7.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8406253" data-originallang="en">For hours, every 30 minutes, groups of people would come up from behind us and put stickers all over the material we were giving out, which said, “Boycott Israeli Apartheid”. Finally, after about three hours of this happening repeatedly, two individuals came to find me. I'd never seen them before, but I had been stalked on Instagram by accounts like Intifada1999. They came to find me and they asked, “Nikki Nashen, why do you support Israeli apartheid?”, to which I responded, “I've never met you before. How do you know my name?”</p>
