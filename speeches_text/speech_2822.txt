<p data-HoCid="7988518" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988519" data-originallang="en">Again, thank you for the testimony.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988520" data-originallang="en">This morning the Humanitarian Coalition did say that they have requested a matching fund. As a New Democrat, I want to express that we would strongly support that request and that we hope the government will take steps to put that in place.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988521" data-originallang="en">What I want to ask about now is military sales, military goods that go to Israel every year. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7988522" data-originallang="en">Canada exports about $22 million in military goods each year. We've long called for a ban on those arms sales to Israel while the occupation continues. Canada is also a signatory to the Arms Trade Treaty. Obviously that requires the states that have signed on to consider human rights in their arms deals.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988523" data-originallang="en"> Do you track whether any of those military goods or technologies sold to Israel are being used in the war in Gaza? Also, how can Canada be in compliance with the Arms Trade Treaty while it continues to export weapons to Israel at this time?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7988524" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
