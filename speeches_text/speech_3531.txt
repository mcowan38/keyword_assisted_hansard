<p data-HoCid="8224309" data-originallang="en"> Thank you. Good afternoon, Mr. Chair, committee members and fellow witnesses. I'm very honoured to be here before you to present before this committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8224310" data-originallang="en">I'm a practising gynecologic oncologist at the Jewish General Hospital in Montreal, and I am also the president-elect of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology of Canada, also called GOC. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8224311" data-originallang="en">GOC is a non-profit organization created 40 years ago as a forum for medical professionals to highlight issues in women's cancer care across Canada to help correct the disparities in cancer care access and to improve equity in research funding for new treatments.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8224312" data-originallang="en">Historically, women's cancers have been orphaned from the traditional cancer care models, so in the 1970s the gynecologic oncology subspecialty was created to care for women with cancers of the Fallopian tube, ovary, uterus, cervix, vulva and placenta. Unfortunately, these cancers have long been, and often still are, deemed a women's issue. Funding for clinical care and research has not kept pace with other more common cancers, such as colorectal, breast or lung cancers. Among all surgical cancer specialities, gynecologic oncology is uniquely comprehensive. Diagnosis, surgery, systemic treatments, surveillance and palliative care are all done by one physician.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8224313" data-originallang="en">GOC has identified three major concerns that need to be addressed swiftly to improve women's cancer care in Canada. First is the backsliding of performance in our prevention of cervical cancer. Second is the rise in incidence and death rates from endometrial cancer and the need for dedicated funding for endometrial cancer research. Third is the need for funding to train health care professionals dedicated to gynecologic oncologies as we start to form our multidisciplinary teams. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8224314" data-originallang="en">A report was published in November 2023 by the Government of Canada with the Canadian Cancer Society on Canadian cancer statistics. It identified cervical cancer as the fastest-growing cancer in women, with incidence rising at a rate of 3.7% per year since 2015. Frankly, to me this is shocking, because women should have easy access to effective cervical cancer prevention strategies in Canada. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8224315" data-originallang="en">Primary prevention via vaccination against the human papillomavirus, or HPV, is offered to school children in every province, as well as to women up to the age of 45, and it has been available in Canada since the 1990s, yet there are decreasing vaccination uptake rates in our population. HPV is the primary cause of cervical cancer as well as vulva, anal and throat cancer. GOC strongly recommends nationwide campaigns to increase the awareness of the burden of HPV and to help increase those vaccination uptake rates. There's also secondary prevention via screening through HPV and pap testing. Unfortunately, our most vulnerable populations are in locations that do not have an organized province-wide screening program yet, or easy access to health care professionals who offer screening, leading to disparities in identification and treatment of these precancerous cervical lesions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8224316" data-originallang="en">We need to support for better provincial-based screening programs for cervical cancer in areas that are not on track to reach our goal of cervical cancer elimination, either through improved access to health care professionals providing screening or through access to HPV self-testing, as offered in some countries and as currently being highlighted in British Columbia.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8224317" data-originallang="en">Second, the same cancer statistics report also identified a worrisome trend of increasing incidence of mortality in endometrial cancer. This can be attributed both to our aging population and to an increase in obesity rates in Canada, which have very strong risk factors for this cancer. We need to increase the numbers of funded gynecological oncology positions in locations that have unequal access to specialized care, as well as access to operating room facilities and robotic surgery to accommodate the rising numbers of these women's cancers.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8224318" data-originallang="en">To support gynecologic cancer research, GOC has created something called the “communities of practice” forums. These forums have facilitated Canadian-based research teams such as the ones run by Dr. McAlpine and her team to collaborate nationally. However, dedicated research funding for endometrial cancer is rare, and we would benefit greatly from specifically earmarked allocations of funds.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8224319" data-originallang="en">Finally, there is a need to increase funding to train other health care professionals in gynecologic cancers in the field of medical oncology, radiation oncology, family medicine and nursing as we grow our multidisciplinary teams to provide holistic patient-centred care. Having more of these specially trained care providers, especially in remote locations, will greatly improve the ability of our patients to receive ongoing care closer to home.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8224320" data-originallang="en"> GOC remains deeply committed to improving research opportunities, advocating timely access to health services and being a strong voice for women's cancer care in Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8224321" data-originallang="en">We look forward to working with the HESA committee and other voices at the table to find solutions to these concerns.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8224322" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
