<p data-HoCid="8703243" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703244" data-originallang="en">Thank you to the witnesses for being here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703245" data-originallang="en">Just as a side comment, I will take Mr. Green at his word that we're in our last days, but let's go back to the subject at hand.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703246" data-originallang="en">Lasting peace is the goal is around this table. That has been the goal of the international community and of the Israeli and Palestinian peoples. It has long been Canada's position, and our allies' position, that we support a two-state solution that's a result of negotiations between both parties—and this is where I want to focus some of my questions—that enjoys popular support from both the Israelis and the Palestinians. This is the only way to lead to lasting peace.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703247" data-originallang="en">This is not a phenomenon that's limited to Israel or Palestine; it's a phenomenon we've experienced here in our own country. Constitutional deals made by leaderships did not survive—think of Meech Lake and Charlottetown—because they did not end up enjoying popular support across our own country. Fortunately, here we haven't had the consequences of death and destruction that both the Israelis and the Palestinian people have suffered.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703248" data-originallang="en">I want to focus on that mechanism, first of all, of popular support. Whether you agree or disagree with the route of the Israeli government, there are elections coming up in 2026, so there's a mechanism in place for the Israeli people to express their will through a process that's self-determined. I heard from the testimony today the importance of self-determination.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703249" data-originallang="en">From the Palestinian people's perspective, who speaks for Palestine? What is the process that leads to a lasting peace? Surveys have shown that 40% of the Palestinian people support the two-state solution. What is the mechanism that you or your organization would advocate as the voice of the Palestinian people to lead toward peace?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703250" data-originallang="en">Maybe we'll start with Mr. Bueckert.</p>
