<p data-HoCid="7716690" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7716691" data-originallang="en">I would also like to thank our witnesses for being here and sharing with us today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7716692" data-originallang="en">Mr. Matas, I'll come back to you. I want to thank you. I think it's very appropriate for you to be here advocating on this issue on Holocaust Remembrance Day, so I want to thank you for that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7716693" data-originallang="en"> I met with some of your colleagues from B'nai Brith in my office just recently and talked about this issue of declassifying Holocaust documents. I think I understood—and correct me if I'm wrong—that the U.S. has a more open system. I'm wondering if you can talk about what they do differently south of the border and, maybe, lessons we can learn up here.</p>
