<p data-HoCid="6791767" data-originallang="en">Okay. Thank you. I have one quick final question before my time runs out. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6791768" data-originallang="en">We know that the big counter to Iran in the region is the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Government of Canada has indicated previously that it welcomed the Abraham Accords. What impact will the recent Gaza conflict have on the status of the Abraham Accords and their potential extension to other states in the region?</p>
