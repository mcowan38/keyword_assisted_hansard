<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">In any event, a few moments ago, the minister noted that some vaccines had been given to certain Caribbean countries. What is more, vaccines were given to Egypt. I commended that donation, which is exceptionally positive.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">That being said, what criteria does the government use to choose a country? We have expressed a desire for Taiwan, which is under pressure from the People's Republic of China, to have access to vaccines. We noted the situation in Palestine, where Israel is preventing the Palestinian population from accessing vaccines, even though the vaccination rate of its own population is extremely high. We have also expressed a desire for vaccines to be offered to Haiti.</p>
