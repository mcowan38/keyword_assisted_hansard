<p data-HoCid="8553401" data-originallang="fr">Madam Speaker, I have here an important petition signed by thousands of people who are telling us that the state of Palestine, governed by the Palestinian National Authority, currently does not have membership in the United Nations. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8553402" data-originallang="fr">Since the State of Israel currently has illegal settlements in the West Bank, there are concerns regarding potential illegal occupation of Gaza. As of 2024, the state of Palestine is recognized by 75% of the United Nations member states, which amounts to 145 out of the 193 member states, recently joined by Spain, Norway, Ireland and Slovenia.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8553403" data-originallang="fr">These people are calling on the Government of Canada to formally recognize the state of Palestine as a full member of the United Nations.</p>
