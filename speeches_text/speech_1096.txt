<p data-HoCid="6791886" data-originallang="fr">I want to come back very quickly to the fact that Canada still has not recognized the Palestinian state, because it is supposedly not viable.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791887" data-originallang="fr">I should point out, however, that for many years, Israel seems to have been doing everything possible to ensure that the Palestinian state is not viable. When I had the opportunity to visit the country after another confrontation between the two peoples, I found that Israel was essentially surgically targeting the infrastructure of the Palestinian state, such as the police stations, the port and the airport. Since everything is done to destructure the Palestinian state, I wonder if we are not part of the problem by refusing to recognize Palestine.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791888" data-originallang="fr">Be that as it may, I want to come back to the issue of the Palestinian elections and the COVIDâ€‘19 pandemic.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791889" data-originallang="fr">Considering that Israel has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world and Palestine has one of the lowest rates on the planet, don't you think that as an occupying power, Israel has a responsibility to the populations under its occupation and that Israel should contribute to the vaccination of the Palestinian population?</p>
