<p data-HoCid="7367085" data-originallang="en">There have been many times when I have risen in this House to speak, but I would have to say there have been few on an issue as important and as serious as this one, the issue of freedom for the Uighur people, or for any people, for that matter, but in this particular case, we are talking about the Uighurs and their right to live their lives as they so choose free of government oppression.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7367086" data-originallang="en">I often think that in this country we take freedom for granted and we tend to think that freedom is free. For someone like myself, who was born and raised in this country, I have a unique perspective in that I have not been on the front lines, so to speak, of a genocide, a holocaust or a war, but I think that we Canadians can learn from people from other parts of the world who have not been so privileged or so lucky and who have earned their freedom— </p>
