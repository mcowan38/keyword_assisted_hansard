<p data-HoCid="8703259" data-originallang="en"> Thank you to the witnesses for being here for this very important study, and thank you to all the members for the shared common goal of ensuring peace and security for everyone in the region, regardless of faith, ethnicity or which border one sits within.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703260" data-originallang="en">I want to ask about the hope that would be created within a Palestinian society for Palestinians, if and when Canada were to recognize a state of Palestine and does recognize the State of Palestine.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703261" data-originallang="en">I understand, Mr. Balsam and Dr. Awad, that both of you have deep links in different ways to Palestinians living in the region. I'd like to hear from both of you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703262" data-originallang="en">Mr. Balsam, I understand that you worked for Oxfam and were stationed in Ramallah for four years. Can you speak about the hope that would be created?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703263" data-originallang="en">To Dr. Awad, I ask you the same question, please.</p>
