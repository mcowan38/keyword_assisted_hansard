<p data-HoCid="8391389" data-originallang="en"> This is not about condemning anti-Semitism, as the member indicates.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8391390" data-originallang="en"> I also find it deeply troubling that part of the rhetoric we heard from the member was also in reference to what's happening on campuses across North America. I think it's very dangerous for parliamentarians to make accusations of the kind we've heard from Conservatives on that front. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8391391" data-originallang="en">Conservatives love to talk about freedom. Here we should be reiterating, as parliamentarians, that we respect students' and Canadians' freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, including when it comes to anti-war protests. Many Canadian young people are standing up against genocide and Canada's complicity in it. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8391392" data-originallang="en">We should be, as parliamentarians, condemning anti-Semitism along with condemning Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian racism. That is not what today's motion purports to do. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8391393" data-originallang="en">To me, the fact that 30 minutes ago the same party chose not to look into the rise of far-right extremist hate really undermines the sincerity of the motion ahead of us and indicates that they're keen to get clicks on social media rather than actually get into taking on anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, anti-Palestinian racism and other forms of hate. As parliamentarians, we need to be genuine in what's being discussed here today. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8391394" data-originallang="en">It's also not lost on me that this is coming up during a debate on the Court Challenges Program, which is a program that is premised on fighting for equality and justice in Canada, fighting against hate on behalf of marginalized communities, communities that have been denied justice time and again. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8391395" data-originallang="en">Canadians see through these kinds of political games. Let's be serious and condemn anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, anti-Palestinian racism, and also support, very clearly, the right to freedom of speech and freedom of assembly that students and Canadians have, and and stand up against all forms of hate. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8391396" data-originallang="en">I will leave it there. I'm looking forward to a productive discussion on this front, rather than scoring political points at a very serious time in our country, particularly given the genocide happening in Gaza and the fear that Jewish communities, Palestinian communities and Muslim communities face. We should be doing them justice by putting forward a motion that has a greater intent and seeks to really take on the kind of hate that we are seeing across the board in our country. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8391397" data-originallang="en">I look forward to having a discussion on that. </p>
