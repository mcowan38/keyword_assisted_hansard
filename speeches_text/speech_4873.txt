<p data-HoCid="8576440" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to the member's speech, and I have several things to say.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576441" data-originallang="fr">He gave some history that I think could have provided fodder for several debates. For example, if we are talking about the world order that was established after the Second World War, that order clearly must have had some grey areas, or we would not be seeing what we are seeing today. Perhaps that is because it was built at the expense of other development models that could have been put in place, but we could have a whole other debate on the history.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576442" data-originallang="fr">However, we cannot just say today that this is a democratic state and that we support it, period. Obviously, Israel has the right to exist. That is fundamental. Obviously, Israel is a democracy, and obviously, Israel is a state that has the right to defend itself. Now it is a geopolitical flashpoint in the region. Because it is a democracy, there are debates and people are not unanimous. Benjamin Netanyahu's policy is not the same as Yitzhak Rabin's was.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576443" data-originallang="fr">What is the Conservative Party's plan to get us out of there?</p>
