<p data-HoCid="7180183" data-originallang="en">I think my questions might have been answered there, so thank you for that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7180184" data-originallang="en">I was just curious if there's a double benefit to this, and maybe I missed this part as well when we explained how the electronic bracelet works, but I'm just wondering if there could be an extended benefit to this clause in pushing forward more access to Internet and services in more rural areas. It could bleed into that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7180185" data-originallang="en">It's just a thought, because I see them as, in response to what Dominique said, reasonable measures. I think the way that it's worded by Ms. Gazan, it says that it's within reasonable measures, but I also see a positive coming out of this amendment in that it's saying we do need access to more Internet, if I'm understanding correctly how the electronic bracelet works.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7180186" data-originallang="en">What I'm talking about in particular in my experience here is that we as MPs have an emergency fob when we're out, and we can click it wherever we are, and it will engage the police, but it only works if there's cell service. Those are my thoughts.</p>
