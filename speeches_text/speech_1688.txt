<p data-HoCid="7168350" data-originallang="en">To be honest, I think that a lot of the conversation we're having right now is a bit backwards. We hear a lot from academics. We hear a lot from law enforcement. However, the victims are not at the centre of this conversation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7168351" data-originallang="en"> Twenty years ago, I used to work for Mothers Against Drunk Driving, and I could see how when you centre victims' voices, that integration supports not only the social services sector but the policing environment and the justice system. The level of intelligence that the system gains as a whole by centring the voices of victims is pivotally important.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7168352" data-originallang="en">Who do we see as victims? As I said, in terms of online hate, we've seen women, women of colour and particularly young people, as those who are being targeted the most, but hate is an evolving target. Sometimes you see Muslims. Sometimes you see members of the Jewish community. The highest numbers have typically been Black and indigenous communities, and now you see anti-Asian racism rising in very high levels. I think it evolves over time.</p>
