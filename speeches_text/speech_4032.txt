<p data-HoCid="8391404" data-originallang="en">I want to set the record straight, because a lot was said in the presentation of this motion today that I believe needs clarification. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8391405" data-originallang="en">Mr. Coteau rightly pointed out that the misrepresentation on social media of what happened in this committee caused harm, caused hurt feelings, caused ill will, and caused further pain to members of the Jewish community, which is simply unacceptable. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8391406" data-originallang="en">For those across the way who somehow believe any of us are equivocating on this subject, let me speak very clearly. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8391407" data-originallang="en">I condemn all forms of anti-Semitism, and all Canadians should. I condemn all forms of anti-Semitism, and all Canadians must. That is who we are as Canadians. There is no place for hate in this country. There should be no place for hate in this country on our campuses, in our streets, in our communities, anywhere. That, I believe, Mr. Chair, is something that we should be able to do all together, without fancy preambles, without hypotheses, without depending on National Post articles. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8391408" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, what we should be able to do as a committee, as Mr. Coteau rightly pointed out, is come together and condemn hate—in this particular case, anti-Semitism, the insidious nature of anti-Semitism—and be united in that message. In so doing, we are saying to people that this isn't a political football. This isn't a game for people to score points on social media. This is a serious issue facing our country. We should let Jewish Canadians know that the fight against anti-Semitism is not their fight alone. It is a fight that all of us are a part of. It is a fight that all of us are committed to—</p>
