<p data-HoCid="8068668" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, tomorrow is Jewish Refugee Day, marking the expulsion of more than 850,000 Jews from their homes in Iran and throughout the Middle East and North Africa. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8068669" data-originallang="en">In the years leading up to the birth of the State of Israel in 1948, Jews were subjected to systemic anti-Semitism and evicted from their homes. They were subjected to arbitrary arrest, torture and murder. This forced migration was marked by religious persecution and even genocide. Many Jews and their families found safe harbour in Israel and here in Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8068670" data-originallang="en">During this trying time for both the State of Israel and Jews here in Canada, it is vital that we do not forget that Jewish communities had existed in these regions for millennia, contributing enormously to the culture, growth and success of Arab nations. This year, B'nai Brith will again be commemorating these refugees. A virtual gathering will be held tomorrow at 4 p.m. I invite members to take part as we commemorate this important part of Jewish history.</p>
