<p data-HoCid="8453835" data-originallang="en">As you know, being issued a code means that you go to the next step and are dealt with as part of the application process. I do want to hasten to add that this is not dealing with Canadian residents, Canadian nationals or permanent residents. They're families of those members, so there does need to be a process that is applied. However, to the extent—and we are working on this—that we can ensure that the assisted departure process is respected, we do our utmost to get them on the list that is to be submitted subsequently to COGAT. Obviously, we don't have discretion as to which ones COGAT then decides are able to leave, but we do all that we can to make sure that the information is gathered and submitted, and then the triage occurs by the Israeli Minister of Defense.</p>
