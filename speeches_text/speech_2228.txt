<p data-HoCid="7642895" data-originallang="en">We certainly share the same objective. I think it's very important to see Bill <a data-HoCid="12138647" href="/bills/44-1/C-35/" title="An Act respecting early learning and child care in Canada">C-35</a> as a tool complementary to the co-developed framework on indigenous early learning and child care.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7642896" data-originallang="en"> One thing we have been very careful not to do is have Bill C-35 go beyond the bounds of the co-developed framework that we did with indigenous early learning and child care, which was announced in 2018 and endorsed by the AFN, ITK and MNC at the time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7642897" data-originallang="en">I've noted one thing very clearly in the travels I've done in the past year around the country. I made a specific note while visiting with indigenous communities and leaders advancing IELCC: This is distinctions-based, indigenous-led and culturally relevant, and it incorporates language learning as well. It's very much indigenous-led and something that is.... We are a funding partner. We co-developed this, but we need to see this as a partnershipâ€”</p>
