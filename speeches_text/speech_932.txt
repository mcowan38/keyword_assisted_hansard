<p data-HoCid="6664162" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, this month, on the eve of the International Holocaust Remembrance Day, the Chabad Centre in Victoria was defaced with anti-Semitic threats, clearly a hate crime. This week saw the release of a report on anti-Semitic incidents in Canada, which showed another annual spike of 18%, the fifth consecutive annual increase.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6664163" data-originallang="en"> Canadians have been without an important and effective tool in fighting hatred since the repeal of section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act by the Conservatives, the section that allowed filing complaints about hate incidents with the Human Rights Commission.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6664164" data-originallang="en">When will the government table legislation to restore section 13 so we can move forward in the fight against hatred of all kinds?</p>
