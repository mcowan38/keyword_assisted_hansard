<p data-HoCid="6944611" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I have never heard such shameful and dishonourable remarks coming from the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>. My great-grandfather flew more than 30 missions over Nazi Germany. My great-great-uncle's body lies at the bottom of the English Channel. Members of the Conservative caucus are descendants of victims of the Holocaust. For the Prime Minister to accuse any colleague in the House of standing with the swastika is shameful. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6944612" data-originallang="en">I am giving the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> an opportunity. I am calling on him to unreservedly apologize for this shameful remark.</p>
