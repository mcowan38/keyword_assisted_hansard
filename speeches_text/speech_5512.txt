<p data-HoCid="8714999" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8715000" data-originallang="en">Mr. Lévêque, I have just one final question, if I may. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8715001" data-originallang="en">You did suggest during your testimony that you are comparing notes with friends and allies as to the possibility of recognizing the state of Palestine. We heard from another witness that Japan, France and the United Kingdom are currently going through some semblance of hearings or studies to determine whether it would be appropriate to do so. However, when Mr. Zuberi asked you about that, I didn't quite get a response from you. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8715002" data-originallang="en">I'm wondering if it would be possible for you to look into whether Japan, France and the U.K. are doing anything at the moment to examine that question and the feasibility of promoting peace by doing so. If you could get back to us in the next week as to whether any of those three countries or any other European country is examining the question, we would be very grateful if you could let us know in writing.</p>
