<p data-HoCid="8784214" data-originallang="en">I want to ask a quick question of Mr. Robertson.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8784215" data-originallang="en">Recently, Library and Archives Canada, which reports to the Minister of Canadian Heritage, decided to continue to shield the names of the Nazis identified by the Deschênes commission who were let into Canada in the years following the Holocaust.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8784216" data-originallang="en">Do you support this committee calling on the <a data-HoCid="300004" href="/politicians/pascale-st-onge/" title="Pascale St-Onge">Minister of Canadian Heritage</a> to instruct Library and Archives Canada to release the names of the Nazis in the Deschênes report?</p>
