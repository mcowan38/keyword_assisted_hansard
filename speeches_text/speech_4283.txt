<p data-HoCid="8435182" data-originallang="en">Dr. Rosenberg, the biggest-ever personal donation to the University of Manitoba—$30 million—was given by philanthropist Ernest Rady to name the medical school after his father, Max Rady. He recently complained to the school about the speech of the valedictorian at the medical school graduation. He basically said that the “speech not only dishonoured the memory of [his] father, but also disrespected and disparaged Jewish people as a whole”. This is where the valedictorian chose to take the medical school graduation—in front of many graduates and faculty who are Jewish—and turn it into a diatribe against Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8435183" data-originallang="en">How does that...? When that happens, Dr. Rosenberg—because you described very well how it made you feel as a faculty member—what happens to a Jewish faculty member or a Jewish student who is in that graduating class?</p>
