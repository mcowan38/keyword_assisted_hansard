<p data-HoCid="6205657" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, the question was how much the government spent. We know it splashed money around in all directions in order to win, in addition to throwing away all of Canada's traditional principles. It will not tell us how much it spent on this failed enterprise to lose votes vis-Ã -vis our last time.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6205658" data-originallang="en">We know how much of our moral authority the government squandered. It stood beside the Iranian totalitarian regime in Tehran, bowed before that regime, apologized to that regime after it shot down a plane killing Canadians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6205659" data-originallang="en">We know the government abandoned Israel, voting against it at the United Nations after only months earlier promising to do the contrary. It refused to list the terrorist Iranian revolutionary armed guard of Canada. It refused to stand up to the dictators around the world and in Asia in order to try to win some votes. It gave up all of this moral authority in exchange for absolutely nothing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6205660" data-originallang="en">It is bad enough when one gives up one's principles. It is even worse when one gives up one's principles and lose anyway. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6205661" data-originallang="en">Given that massive failure, will the government at least tell Canadian taxpayers how much is squandered on this failed global campaign?</p>
