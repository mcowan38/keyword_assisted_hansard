I think, at the end of the day, none of them wants to see more of the tragic consequences that we experienced. I think that's positive.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791949" data-originallang="en">The domestic political situation in Israel has been chaotic and very difficult for a number of years with four elections. I think Prime Minister Netanyahu has been successful up to this point in maintaining his role, but just recently we have what they call an anti-Netanyahu coalition, which has indicated to President Rivlin that they can form a government. We'll see what happens with the voting in a couple of weeks whether there is a different coalition in place.</p>

In building that space between Palestinians and Israelis, there's concern about how successful we're going to be in the near term, but we continue to work very closely with our Israeli friends. We continue to work with our allies and partners and with the Palestinians. There is only the path of prosperity and stability because that's what everyone wants.</p>
