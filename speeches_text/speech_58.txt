<p data-HoCid="6081109" data-originallang="en">Thank you. We're back in session.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6081110" data-originallang="en">I am advised by the clerk that one option in terms of how to proceed—and I will, of course, be guided by the committee, but let me convey to you the procedural advice I've received—is that Mr. Vaughan could propose that the motion be amended by deleting all the words after “that” and replacing them with his motion. That is one option, but I would be more interested in whether you reached a consensus during the suspension, rather than relying on that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6081111" data-originallang="en">Ms. Gazan, please.</p>
