<p data-HoCid="8628394" data-originallang="en"> Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8628395" data-originallang="en">Welcome, Minister.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8628396" data-originallang="en">In the foreword of the current anti-racism strategy you said:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8628397" data-originallang="en"> ...since the events of October 7, 2023, we have seen unprecedented levels of hate towards Jewish, Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian communities right here in Canada. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8628398" data-originallang="en"> This is unquestionably true. Since then, we've seen a worrying explosion of hate and anger directed at members of these communities. The reality is that no Jewish family should worry about the safety of their kids when they drop them off at Hebrew school. No Muslim should fear violence as they walk into a mosque. We have a responsibility as legislators to do everything in our power to protect communities from hate. This is why I don't understand why your Liberal government steadfastly refused to define anti-Palestinian racism. You acknowledge that it's a problem, and the strategy explicitly recognizes Palestinians as a group that faces a unique form of racism. You acknowledge that work needs to be done, but for some reason you refuse to actually do that work. You refuse to consult with community members on the topic. Their voices were silenced.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8628399" data-originallang="en">This can't come as a surprise. Thousands of Canadians wrote to you, calling on you to define anti-Palestinian racism. I've raised this repeatedly with officials in your office, and we've also raised it here at committee. I would argue that ignoring these calls is, frankly, a clear and explicit example of systemic anti-Palestinian racism. You've refused to give a clear reason for why you refuse to define anti-Palestinian racism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8628400" data-originallang="en">My question is this: Did you intentionally leave out anti-Palestinian racism from your Liberal anti-racism strategy, yes or no?</p>
