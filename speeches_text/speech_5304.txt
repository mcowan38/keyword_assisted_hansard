<p data-HoCid="8693805" data-originallang="en">I think there has certainly been a growing criticism, both inside the Beltway in Washington and within the Democratic Party, over the Biden administration's apparent unwillingness to uphold U.S. law with regard to arms sales. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693806" data-originallang="en">There does seem to be some movement recently. A few weeks ago, a letter was sent, basically telling the Israeli government that unless they allowed more humanitarian aid in, there would be a restriction on arms sales.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8693807" data-originallang="en">Clearly, things are shifting. I think the conversation is shifting toward thinking about imposing restrictions on U.S. military aid to Israel. President Biden has made it very clear that he's not willing to countenance that, but if there's a different administration—if there's a Harris administration—I think you will see more willingness to do that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8693808" data-originallang="en">More broadly, I think there is a recognition that there needs to be some fundamental changes in the U.S. approach to this conflict. I think that even includes considering the recognition of a Palestinian state as well. </p>
