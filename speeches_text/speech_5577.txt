<p data-HoCid="8731902" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8731903" data-originallang="en"> I'd like to start by giving notice of the following motion:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8731904" data-originallang="en"> Given that: </p>
<p data-HoCid="8731905" data-originallang="en"> a. During a recent Remembrance Day ceremony at Sir Robert Borden High School, the school played an anti-Israel protest song associated with the ongoing war in Gaza instead of playing music associated with the service and sacrifice of Canadian service members; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8731906" data-originallang="en"> b. The principal of the school defended the choice, complaining that Remembrance Day is too often about “a white guy who has done something related to the military”; </p>
<p data-HoCid="8731907" data-originallang="en"> The committee report to the House its opinion that the principal of Sir Robert Borden High School should be terminated for his actions. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8731908" data-originallang="en"> Obviously, this is a disgraceful situation that dishonours the memory and sacrifice of many of our Canadian soldiers, and I want to put this motion on notice today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8731909" data-originallang="en"> I'll now turn to some questions I have.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8731910" data-originallang="en"> I'd like to know if indigenous veterans who utilize other programs, such as the on-reserve income assistance program, have their benefits or entitlements from VAC affected by that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8731911" data-originallang="en"> For example, would these indigenous-specific programs be counted against income-tested benefits, such as the income replacement benefit from VAC, and would indigenous veterans have their incomes and benefits reduced as a result of their heritage?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8731912" data-originallang="en"> Can you tell me if that, in fact, occurs?</p>
