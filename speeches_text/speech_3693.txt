<p data-HoCid="8284463" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8284464" data-originallang="fr">Thank you to the witnesses for being here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8284465" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Lévêque, thank you for committing in your opening remarks to providing the committee with the documents it requires. However, I would like to say something. On December 6, the committee requested written responses on Canada's voting process at the United Nations, on export permits, on the International Criminal Court and on the International Court of Justice, but the committee is still waiting for those responses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8284466" data-originallang="fr">My first questions are about Israel's blockade of basic necessities since the start of the conflict. The supplies are coming in through Rafah in a very piecemeal fashion. Despite the famine that ensued, the Department of Foreign Affairs has never expressed the view that what Israel is doing violates international law. I would like to know if that is still the case. What is the department's current position? Does it consider Israel's actions to be in violation of international law?</p>
