<p data-HoCid="8009979" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, we unequivocally condemn the Hamas terrorist attack. The price of justice cannot be the continued suffering of all Palestinian civilians. What is unfolding in Gaza is a human tragedy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8009980" data-originallang="en"> The <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="MÃ©lanie Joly">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> has been to the region twice to oversee our efforts to help Canadians, but also to de-escalate the situation. That is why we continue to call for international humanitarian law to be upheld and for humanitarian pauses, so Canadians can leave, humanitarian aid can get in and all hostages can be released.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8009981" data-originallang="en">Canada is committed to a goal of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.</p>
