<p data-HoCid="8681751" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I would like to join with my Bloc colleague to offer my sincerest apologies. Actually, I was looking for my tiny violin, but I am not allowed props, so I thought maybe I could not use it, unfortunately. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8681752" data-originallang="en">What I am interested in, however, is the recognition, absolutely, that the NDP ripped up the agreement. From our end, it was because we simply could not continue to support the government in the fact that it was ignoring a war in Gaza and ignoring the massive amount of corporate greed in Canada and doing nothing about it. While we could work together to some degree to get some of the things we wanted, certainly, they were not all of the things New Democrats want. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8681753" data-originallang="en">Maybe the member could talk a bit about where the government has failed and take responsibility for some of the actions we see here today.</p>
