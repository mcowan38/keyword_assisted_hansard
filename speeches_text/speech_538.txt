<p data-HoCid="6468145" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, today is International Holocaust Remembrance Day, and with deep love, I honour my grandmother. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6468146" data-originallang="en">I adored my grandmother, a survivor of the Auschwitz concentration camp, and a woman of courage who gave up my father into hiding during the war, which saved his life. It was a fortunate choice, a choice that graced me with having him as a father. He was the only surviving child on both sides of my paternal family after the war, with five survivors in total. As a mother, I cannot imagine having to make that choice, but she did in all of her courage, kindness, wisdom and strength.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6468147" data-originallang="en">To all individuals who lost loved ones during the war whom they may have known, to all those who feel a loss due to those relatives they were never blessed to know but whom they cherish in their blood memory, I extend my heart, strength and hope for a better, kinder, more gentle world for all today as we strive to ensure human rights and dignity for all.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6468148" data-originallang="en">I remember. We remember.</p>
