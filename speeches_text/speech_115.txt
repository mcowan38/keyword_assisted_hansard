<p data-HoCid="6063604" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, bullying is never acceptable in our society, whether it is in our schools, workplaces, homes, online or even in Parliament. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6063605" data-originallang="en">Today is Pink Shirt Day, a day to raise awareness of the ongoing issue of bullying. Whether bullying takes the form of racism, including anti-black and anti-indigenous racism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, gender-based violence, homophobia, transphobia or even bullying someone for wearing a pink shirt, we will stand together to fight it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6063606" data-originallang="en"> We are seeing a dramatic rise in bullying and hate that is allowed to flourish on the Internet. Social media platforms must take a responsibility for removing hateful and extremist content before it can do harm.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6063607" data-originallang="en">As New Democrats, we recognize the inherent dignity of all people and are about building a sense of community. Let us recommit to countering bullying and hate in our communities and in our country.</p>
