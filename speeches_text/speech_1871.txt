<p data-HoCid="7345605" data-originallang="en">As the minister responsible, on behalf of the government, I can state unequivocally that combatting anti-Semitism and combatting hate against Jewish Canadians are absolutely a priority for our government. We have taken a number of steps in that regard and we will continue to be a strong champion in the fight against anti-Semitism in this country.</p>
