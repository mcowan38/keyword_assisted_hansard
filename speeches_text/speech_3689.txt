<p data-HoCid="8284433" data-originallang="en">UNRWA is a UN organization guided by UN rules. It employs 33,000 peopleâ€”13,000 in Gaza alone. The allegations that were made were initially against 11 or 12 individuals.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8284434" data-originallang="en">We immediately saw UNRWA take measures to suspend these individuals. Ever since that, a number of measures have been taken by UNRWA itself to review its processes and to review its processes for clearing employees. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8284435" data-originallang="en">The UN headquarters, led by the Secretary-General, have put measures in place. We've been briefed on interim reports that the office of control of the UN has written, so we can see that immediate measures were taken. The bad apples, if you will, the negative elements, were fired to allow the organization that is absolutely essential to humanitarian assistance in Gaza to continue to operate. </p>
