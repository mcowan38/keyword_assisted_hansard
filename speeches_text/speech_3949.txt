<p data-HoCid="8344465" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8344466" data-originallang="en">I want to thank all our witnesses for being here today. I just wish we had more time to ask questions of everybody.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8344467" data-originallang="en">I would like to direct my questions to Dr. German, and perhaps we'll have a longer discussion once we get into the parliamentary review of the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8344468" data-originallang="en">I appreciate your feedback on the third party money-laundering changes, the undertaking requirement and the white-label ATMs now being included in the proceeds of crime act. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8344469" data-originallang="en">You said, “We are tweaking our legislation; we are not grabbing it, shaking it and making sure it is effective.” I'll take the bait here. When you mention that, what would it look like to you if we were “grabbing it, shaking it and making sure it is effective”?</p>
