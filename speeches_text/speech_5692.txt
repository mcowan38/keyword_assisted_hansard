<p data-HoCid="8783210" data-originallang="fr"> The interesting thing about Bill <a data-HoCid="12830843" href="/bills/44-1/C-373/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (promotion of hatred or antisemitism)">C‑63</a> is that it addresses the idea of deepfakes, a term used for the first time in the law. It addresses not only revenge porn, the disclosure of images showing intimate relations without consent, but also communicating images of women created entirely artificially. Whether it is really the woman who appears in the image or it is a faked representation of her, the result is the same: the woman is being punished, isolated and frightened, particularly on social media.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8783211" data-originallang="fr">That is why this bill is so important. It is not just for adult women; it is also for young teens. We have repeatedly seen how they are victims of attacks by predators. I am thinking of Rehtaeh Parsons and Amanda Todd, and of young boys. These young teens do not have the capacity or tools they need to fight back against predators, and sometimes the result is that they commit suicide, which is a tragedy.</p>

This is also about saving our young people, our teens and our women.</p>
