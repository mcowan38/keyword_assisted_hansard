<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, my colleague from <a data-HoCid="253019" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> mentioned many different subjects and various topics. What I would like to focus on is students and on our relief for students. As I mentioned in my remarks, I have spoken to many students who are very appreciative of the government's response. We provided the Canada emergency student benefit. We are doubling the Canada student grant amount to $6,000. </p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Bill <a data-HoCid="11003629" href="/bills/43-2/C-14/" title="An Act to implement certain provisions of the economic statement tabled in Parliament on November 30, 2020 and other measures">C-14</a> proposes to eliminate the interest on repayment of the federal portion of the Canada student and apprenticeship loans for 2021 and 2022. This would bring over $300 million in relief for up to 1.4 million Canadian students. </p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">This is not just a talking point. This would be real for students and would help put money back into their pockets, so they can support their livelihoods.</p>
