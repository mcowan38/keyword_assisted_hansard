<p data-HoCid="8284390" data-originallang="en">Welcome to meeting number 98 of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development. Today's meeting is taking place in a hybrid format pursuant to the Standing Orders. Therefore, members are attending in person in the room as well as remotely via the Zoom application.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8284391" data-originallang="en">I'd like to make a few comments for the benefit of the witnesses and, of course, for the members as well.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8284392" data-originallang="en">Before speaking, please do wait until I recognize you by name. You may speak in the official language of your choice.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8284393" data-originallang="en">Although this room is equipped with a powerful audio system, feedback events can occur. These can be extremely harmful to interpreters and cause serious injuries. The most common cause, I will remind all of you, is sound feedback, which occurs when an earpiece is worn too close to a microphone.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8284394" data-originallang="en">With regard to a speaking list, the committee clerk and I will do our best to maintain a consolidated order of speaking for all members.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8284395" data-originallang="en">Pursuant to Standing Order 108(2), the committee will proceed to hear from officials with a briefing on the situation in Israel and Gaza.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8284396" data-originallang="en">I'd like to welcome our distinguished witnesses. We're very fortunate to have here before us Mr. Alexandre Lévêque, who of course is the assistant deputy minister for Europe, Arctic, Middle East and Maghreb. We also have with us Mr. Louis-Martin Aumais, director general and deputy legal adviser for the public international law bureau. Lastly, we have Mr. Sébastien Beaulieu, director general and chief security officer, and he is with the security and emergency management office.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8284397" data-originallang="en">You have five minutes for your opening remarks, Mr. Lévêque. Thank you for being here.</p>
