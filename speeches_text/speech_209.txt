<p data-HoCid="6206312" data-originallang="en"> Honourable members of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, thank you for inviting the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity at the University of New Brunswick to speak today about cybersecurity considerations relating to the establishment of a hybrid Parliament.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6206313" data-originallang="en">My name is Ali Ghorbani. I am a professor of computer science, a tier one Canada research chair in cybersecurity, and the founder and director of the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6206314" data-originallang="en">Cybersecurity and privacy, once issues only for technology experts, have become widespread concerns in business and society. Cybersecurity is no longer just an IT problem; it's a business problem; it's everyone's problem. The weakest link in cybersecurity is now people, not devices. Here at the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity, we think that the human factor is considered the biggest threat to cybersafety, and we strongly believe that cybersecurity requires multidisciplinary and human-centric solutions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6206315" data-originallang="en">The Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity is one of the first institutions to bring together researchers from across the academic spectrum to share innovative ideas and carry out groundbreaking research into the most pressing cybersecurity challenges of our time. We have been doing research and development and entrepreneurial activities in this area non-stop for over two decades. We have developed multiple practical network security solutions, and our research has led to the establishment of several companies. Currently, the institute has a team of 60 researchers, technical staff and graduate students, and a state-of-the-art architecture and infrastructure.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6206316" data-originallang="en">The science of cybersecurity is about managing risks and avoiding surprises. There will be security risks with any online communication platform. In the “Virtual Chamber” report of May 7, 2020, it is written:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="6206317" data-originallang="en"> Members who wish to participate remotely will connect using a videoconferencing platform integrated into existing on-premise technologies. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="6206318" data-originallang="en">Let me briefly highlight the security and privacy issues in relation to the proposed platform from two perspectives: users and organizers.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6206319" data-originallang="en">On the user side, the first issue is awareness of cybersecurity. The remote participants who use the platform for virtual sittings must be aware of the security risks associated with the use of online video conferencing platforms or, if not, must be trained for such. The goal is to avoid issues such as installing platform software from an unofficial site, which can be malware; phishing scams asking to join video conferences, which steal credentials; and overprivileged video conferencing application by using the web version, which sits in a sandbox in the browser when possible, instead of installing an application.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6206320" data-originallang="en">The second issue is technical issues for remote access. The remote participants who use the platform for virtual sittings must have satisfactory assets for remote access or, if not, must be provided with such. The goal is to avoid issues such as hardware shutdown during connection due to power outage, which can be considered as an availability issue; slow connection and breaking during meeting, which can be considered as an availability and/or integrity issue; and vulnerable webcams, which can be accessed by unauthorized users and can be considered as confidentiality and privacy issues.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6206321" data-originallang="en">On the organizer side, the first issue is trusted computing based on trusted hardware. With regard to the proposed integration of a multimedia system with video conferencing and a voting system, it is known that a system is as secure as its weakest link.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6206322" data-originallang="en">Furthermore, computing hardware has security issues, such as branch direction prediction attacked by Spectre.variant 1. Therefore, it raises the need to use trusted hardware such as trusted platform module, TPM, also known as ISO/IEC 11889, which is a dedicated microcontroller designed to secure hardware through integrated cryptographic keys.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6206323" data-originallang="en">The second issue is verifiable software. The software integrated in the virtual chamber must be verified, or if not, it must be open sourced, such as Helios for online elections system, or openly reviewed such as a Zoom proposal for end-to-end encryption for video conferencing. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6206324" data-originallang="en">The goal is to avoid software vulnerabilities, such as meeting bombing when an unauthorized person joins a meeting; client application chat issues, malicious links and arbitrary file write; and security risks related to operating systems of the video conferencing platform and user management system. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6206325" data-originallang="en">Last but not least, the third issue is secure cloud and networking technologies. The network integrated to the virtual chamber must be private, or if not, it must be secured. The goal is to avoid cloud and network vulnerabilities, such as security risks related to streaming video, such as stream grabbing and uploading; and security risks related to data routing, such as route manipulation and route hijacking, which requires that the integrated platform must offer the ability to choose through which region of the world their data would be routed. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6206326" data-originallang="en">With that, thank you again for inviting me to be with you today. I look forward to your questions.</p>
