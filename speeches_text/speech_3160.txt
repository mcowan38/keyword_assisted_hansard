<p data-HoCid="8100209" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. McKinnon. I am in mental health, so I love your question. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8100210" data-originallang="en">I'm just going to say very quickly that trauma is very complex, and that is what really separates it and makes it different from just simple anxiety or simple depression or these types of things. That's why it's so important to have somebody who understands trauma, because there are so many different aspects of it. I suspect if you start reading, you will fall down a rabbit hole, because there is so much to learn about it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100211" data-originallang="en">Really, I think that's actually very important for anybody who works with victims to understand. If you are victimized, you are more than likely traumatized, and to understand the victim, you have to understand trauma.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100212" data-originallang="en">That's probably where I will leave it. As Tennille and Marcia have said, we thank you and we hope for change. Any time you all would like to have us back and have any more input in this process, we are more than happy to do this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8100213" data-originallang="en">We feel very privileged to be a part of this. Thank you.</p>
