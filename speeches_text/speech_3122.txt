<p data-HoCid="8069508" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8069509" data-originallang="en">Thank you so much, Senator, for your work on this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8069510" data-originallang="en">I think this is really important for people who don't know the backstory. When bills come forward, it's really important for people at home to understand why somebody puts work into what they do. You referenced Julie. I think it's really important that we say Julie's name when we're at this. It was your daughter who was murdered.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8069511" data-originallang="en">I'm reading a very powerful quote from you. You said:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8069512" data-originallang="en"> Changing the system takes a lot of energy. But I had no right to miss the mission that Julie had given me. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8069513" data-originallang="en"> Joining the Senate gave me the opportunity to be part of a change. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8069514" data-originallang="en"> One day I will return to Julie, it will be her, my judge. And I'm sure she'll tell me that we've done great things together, the two of us. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8069515" data-originallang="en">It's pretty powerful when we appreciate where this bill came from and the intention behind it. We are a very powerful committee here. I heard my colleague, Ms. Gazan, say there's criticism that it will give a false sense of security.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8069516" data-originallang="en">What we're talking about, for those watching, is a bracelet for people who are at risk of repeat offending domestic violence. Right now, there's no security. There's nothing in place. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8069517" data-originallang="en">The thing that jumped out at me, Senator, is that you've said this bill will amend section 515, so that the victim must be consulted. That is significant when we look at victims' rights in this country, where they feel like they're in the back seat and that the criminals are first. How are you going to ensure with this bill that victims are consulted and they know where their attacker is?</p>
