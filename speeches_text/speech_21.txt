<p data-HoCid="6086896" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6086897" data-originallang="fr">Dr. Njoo, you said numerous times that you had good communication with health authorities in Quebec, the other provinces and the territories. However, Karl Weiss, a well-known virologist at Montreal's Jewish General Hospital, told Radio-Canada on Monday that he had not seen any effective coordination by the federal government.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6086898" data-originallang="fr">How do you explain that? What tangible steps have you taken to ensure coordination? Can you give us the details of your plan?</p>
