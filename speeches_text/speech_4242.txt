<p data-HoCid="8434964" data-originallang="en">Again, I just want to reiterate how important it is for this committee to be examining this issue and making recommendations. Our office is very much looking forward to not just the recommendations but also any research that you may have done in preparation for this committee that would help us to move forward in our work.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8434965" data-originallang="en">Absolutely, there is no question that EDI is failing Jews in this country. EDI is failing anti-Semitism. It focuses on a very narrow description of marginalized, racialized or equity-seeking groups, and it does not address anti-Semitism at all. That has to change. We have seen this over and over again, which is why we're working with EDI heads, and it's why, when we talk about working with university administrations, we focus particularly on EDI units. However, again, I would say that it's not just at universities. We also have to look at this in business environments and in our own government environments.</p>
