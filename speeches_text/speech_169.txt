<p data-HoCid="6169349" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, all the member has to do is check the record for what I have said in regard to Israelis and Palestinians and the continuing conflict by the Palestinian regimes that subjugate their people. The corruption of Palestinian Authority has been proven over and over again. Hamas is a recognized terrorist organization.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6169350" data-originallang="en">We hope that individual Palestinians of good will who want freedom will one day see their freedom observed. Of course, we continually defend the rights of Israelis to safety and security and their own democracy in Israel.</p>
