<p data-HoCid="8483084" data-originallang="en"> Madam Speaker, I will try to go quickly because, unlike the Conservatives, I am actually concerned about other members in the House.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8483085" data-originallang="en">Hundreds of constituents in the riding of Waterloo are petitioning the House of Commons, drawing to its attention what is taking place in Israel and Gaza, which has resulted in thousands of deaths. They are calling on Parliament to do everything in our power to bring an immediate and permanent ceasefire to that region. They are asking that we impose a two-way arms embargo, including arms trades via the United States and so forth.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8483086" data-originallang="en">They are asking Canada to do whatever we can to end the situation in Gaza. There have been a lot of lives left, and it is important that these voices be heard. I am proud to represent them through this petition in the House.</p>
