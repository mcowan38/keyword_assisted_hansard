<p data-HoCid="8679461" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679462" data-originallang="en">I want to talk about the larger geopolitical context of all of this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679463" data-originallang="en">Only 8% of the world's population lives in democracies. Forty per cent of the world's population lives in authoritarian states. That's according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. Of the 190 or so member states in the United Nations, only maybe three dozen are full-fledged democracies. The rest, some 150-plus states, are not considered full-fledged democracies. When we look at democracies, the vast majority of democracies believe that the recognition of a Palestinian state should come as a result of a negotiated two-state solution, and not immediately.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679464" data-originallang="en">I think we need to situate this conflict in the Middle East in a larger context. Canada is a liberal democracy, as I think everybody around the table would agree. Israel is also a liberal democracy. Democracies are flawed. They're not perfect, but Canada and Israel are both liberal democracies. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8679465" data-originallang="en">The conflicts between Israel and Hamas, between Israel and Hezbollah, and between Israel and Iran are not taking place in a vacuum. It is part of a rising clash between a rising authoritarianism and democracies like Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679466" data-originallang="en">On the other side of that clash are authoritarian states like the Russian Federation, the People's Republic of China and the Islamic Republic of Iran. In our view, there is no question on which side of the line Canada should stand. We stand with liberal democracies.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8679467" data-originallang="en">I'd just like the witness's commentary on the situation in that larger context.</p>
