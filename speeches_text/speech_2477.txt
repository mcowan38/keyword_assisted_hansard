<p data-HoCid="7928140" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, on a separate point of order, while our member was speaking, a member of Jewish heritage, the member for <a data-HoCid="278514" href="/politicians/mark-gerretsen/" title="Mark Gerretsen">Kingston and the Islands</a> used unparliamentary language again by swearing at one of our members who was trying to make a point, a legitimate point, about a very difficult and sensitive matter, particularly for those of Jewish heritage. He should apologize again.</p>
