<p data-HoCid="8756836" data-originallang="en"> Madam Speaker, Canada is committed to lasting peace in the Middle East, including the creation of a Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with Israel. Canada is prepared to recognize a Palestinian state at the right time, conducive to a lasting peace and not necessarily as the last step along the path.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8756837" data-originallang="en"> Let me assure the hon. member that we remain fixated on this conflict. Just yesterday, my colleague, the member for <a data-HoCid="278191" href="/politicians/rob-oliphant/" title="Rob Oliphant">Don Valley West</a> and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, delivered Canada's national address to the Cairo Ministerial Conference to Enhance the Humanitarian Response in Gaza. The needs of civilians in Gaza are dire. That is why, on Friday, the government announced an additional $50 million in humanitarian assistance, raising the total to $215 million. Canada will continue to be there. We will work with our partners and allies. The violence must stop.</p>
