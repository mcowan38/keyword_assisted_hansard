<p data-HoCid="6080998" data-originallang="en">Could we not have some discussion on this motion and get some feedback on it? I understand there may be some people who have some amendments to the motion, but I'd like to explain why I want to put this motion on the table, if that's possible.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6080999" data-originallang="en">It's quite clear that we all, as parliamentarians, need to address the issue of indigenous homelessness in our communities. I would expect it's a concern for all of us. I come from London, Ontario, which is a community of nearly 400,000 people in southwestern Ontario. We have three neighbouring indigenous communities. The city is challenged, like so many others, with the rapid increase in the number of individuals experiencing homelessness. Of these, an even higher proportion identify as indigenous—29% of London's homeless population identify as indigenous. The city has been working with an indigenous-led community plan focused on solving indigenous homelessness through a culture-first, housing-first model. I believe that our government can learn from this model.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6081000" data-originallang="en">London is the 11th-largest designated community in Ontario, but it is home to the third-highest percentage of the population that identifies as indigenous. I think you can see why I find this to be such an important topic for my community and for this committee as well.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6081001" data-originallang="en">The UN special rapporteur examined the right to housing of indigenous peoples and recognized the right to adequate housing to be interdependent with and indivisible from the rights and legal principles set out in UNDRIP. Homelessness for indigenous people is unique from non-indigenous people, because available resources are often ill-suited to respond to their needs. As an example, sometimes housing is provided through charities tied to churches that were responsible for some of the trauma they experienced. We need to look at the problem of indigenous housing with its own lens, and that's what I'm asking for today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6081002" data-originallang="en">The term “indigenous” refers to first nations, Métis and Inuit. They are distinct peoples, with their own cultures, rights and relationships with the Crown. Improving indigenous housing is a priority for the national housing strategy, but I think the national housing strategy is a part that we need to focus on as far as indigenous housing is concerned. That's why I think it's important for this committee to take a look specifically at this issue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6081003" data-originallang="en">I think MP Gazan has something to suggest for my motion, if she'd like to present that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6081004" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
