<p data-HoCid="7048546" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Dr. Cohen. I appreciate that.</p>

<p data-HoCid="7048548" data-originallang="en"> My colleague talked a bit about doses in the future, vaccine durability and how many doses we're going to need. Dr. Warshawsky, could you speak a bit, if you would, about the future of vaccines and what that may look like in terms of variants? How many doses are we talking about? I believe Israel is on dose number five.</p>
