<p data-HoCid="7970505" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7970506" data-originallang="en">I am sure that for many of our colleagues around this table, the past week has not been an easy one as we navigate through what was a terror attack on innocent Israeli civilians by Hamas, and by what has been an evacuation proceeding of Canadians who not only lost their lives but also were put in a very precarious situation in Israel and Gaza. Over the past week, we've also seen innocent lives lost in Gaza—the majority of them being children and innocent civilians—based on a complete and utter disregard for human life on both sides of this. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7970507" data-originallang="en">Canada's role, I think, feeds into that of the international community. Right now, Mr. Chair, it is so important for us as parliamentarians to provide support and a platform for communities that are hurt. In my riding, I've been in touch with our local synagogue, Palestinian organizations and local mosques. People are very scared. This issue seems to have sparked a fire. We've worked way too hard, through our multiculturalism policy and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, to ensure that Canadians not only feel safe but also are safe. When constituents come to me and tell me they don't feel comfortable sending their kids to school or voicing their opinions for fear of violence or backlash.... When I look at my own social media, Mr. Chair, I'm appalled at how many times I deal with a lot of racist commentary, and I know many of my colleagues across all parties are dealing with the same. This is a very polarizing issue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7970508" data-originallang="en"> A lot of information has flooded our airwaves over the past week. There's been a lot of misinformation, bullying and trying to suppress voices. I think, as Canadians, we owe everyone in Canada the ability to speak their minds as long as they respect our Charter of Rights and Freedoms. I think the media have a critical role to play in this day and age, not only to ensure they are giving an objective and fair voice to what is happening in the Middle East—and across the world, as issues arise—but also to make sure they are not politicizing or inflaming any issues that create further harm and hurt to communities here in Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7970509" data-originallang="en"> In my riding, Mr. Chair, 43 different languages are spoken. We are a very diverse riding. Over these past eight years, we've ensured that in Mississauga—Erin Mills we are building bridges, not breaking them or dividing each other based on our political standpoints. I think, first and foremost, as parliamentarians, that we have an obligation to ensure that Canadians have the safety and security to maintain themselves—their health, sanity and safety—within our communities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7970510" data-originallang="en"> When I see a motion here that wants to bring a news publication before a committee to question it on whatever it has been posting, I automatically see flags. I question whether it is our right as a committee to do that. The media are our watchdogs. They will post and say what needs to be said.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7970511" data-originallang="en"> We, as Parliament, whether we agree with it or don't agree with it, should not have a say in what they're reporting on, because that defeats the purpose of the media as watchdogs of our government and of parliamentarians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7970512" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, I think that we need to lower the temperature—and not just here in Parliament—on this very sensitive issue, with so many people who are hurt and hurting. I think we need to take a breather and to perhaps, at a later time, come back to this issue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7970513" data-originallang="en">At this time, I move that we adjourn debate.</p>
