<p data-HoCid="8594906" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, today is October 7, the anniversary of a horrific attack on Jews, with 1,200 people killed and over 200 people taken hostage. Our solidarity is with Jews in Israel and with Jewish people in Canada and right around the world.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8594907" data-originallang="en">What we stand up against, absolutely, is the amount of hatred that we have seen in this country and countries around the world. People have targeted Jewish Canadian schools, day cares and synagogues for acts that they have a problem with on another side of the world. We are better than that in this country. We need to stand up against that kind of hatred in support of Jewish people and for all people who defend their ability to worship how and whom they choose.</p>
