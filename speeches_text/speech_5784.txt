<p data-HoCid="8756824" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I will begin by thanking the member for <a data-HoCid="278717" href="/politicians/mike-morrice/" title="Mike Morrice">Kitchener Centre</a> for his question and his ongoing attention to this subject.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8756825" data-originallang="en"> We too share the member's immense sense of grief, and our hearts break for the tragic loss of civilian life in Israel and Gaza. In particular, we grieve for the children, who have been disproportionately affected by this ongoing conflict. However, let us also acknowledge that this debate is taking place after a ceasefire was secured between Israel and Hezbollah. Though we remain horrified by the loss of civilian life in Lebanon and northern Israel, this ceasefire is the product of tireless and creative diplomacy. As our world becomes increasingly unstable, direct diplomatic engagement remains the most productive tool in building peace. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8756826" data-originallang="en">Of course, the horrific attacks by Hamas against Israeli citizens on October 7 still shock us all. We continue to condemn Hamas, a listed terrorist organization, unequivocally. We will never forget the pain and suffering caused by its heinous acts of violence. Canada also condemns Hamas's unacceptable treatment of hostages. We continue to call for not only the immediate and unconditional release of all remaining hostages but also the return of the bodies of hostages killed in Gaza. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8756827" data-originallang="en">What has been happening in Gaza is catastrophic. The humanitarian situation was already dire. Civilians in Gaza have nowhere else to go and, as the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">minister</a> has said, asking them to move again is unacceptable. The violence must stop. Canada has been calling for an immediate, sustainable ceasefire for months, but this cannot be one-sided; Hamas must lay down its arms.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8756828" data-originallang="en">Humanitarian aid must also be urgently increased and sustained. The need for humanitarian assistance in Gaza has never been greater. Rapid, safe and unimpeded humanitarian relief must be provided to civilians. Canada was the first G7 country to act, and we will continue to work with partners towards ensuring sustained access to humanitarian assistance for civilians, including food, water, medical care, fuel, shelter and access for humanitarian workers. Today, Canada has announced $215 million in humanitarian assistance to address the urgent needs of vulnerable civilians in this crisis. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8756829" data-originallang="en">When it comes to UNRWA, we understand the vital role it plays in delivering aid to Palestinian civilians. Legislation passed by the Israeli government aimed at revoking the privileges and immunities of UNRWA is cause for grave concern. It is also critical that UNRWA continue its reform program, demonstrate its commitment to the principle of neutrality and ensure that its activities remain entirely in line with its mandate. We continue to urge the Israeli government to abide by its international obligations and allow for the full, rapid, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance. Civilians continue to bear the brunt of the unfolding tragedy. Canada's commitment to life-saving humanitarian aid remains unwavering.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8756830" data-originallang="en"> We condemn the killing of civilians in Lebanon, Gaza, the West Bank and Israel. We continue to insist that civilians be protected. Attacks on hospitals, aid delivery sites and refugee camps have caused the deaths of dozens of civilians seeking refuge.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8756831" data-originallang="en"> When it comes to South Africa's case at the International Court of Justice, the court has been clear on the provisional measures. Israel must ensure the delivery of basic services and essential humanitarian assistance, and it must protect civilians. The court's decisions on provisional measures are binding.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8756832" data-originallang="en">We have also seen the expansion of settlements accelerating in the West Bank as settler violence continues. We continue to respond to the urgent needs—</p>
