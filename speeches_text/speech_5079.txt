<p data-HoCid="8643247" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, the rapid and unimpeded access of humanitarian relief for the more than two million civilians in Gaza is critical. UNRWA plays a critical role in delivering humanitarian assistance and essential services to Gaza and the West Bank. There are 123 countries that think the same and have signed on this year to a statement of shared commitments to UNRWA. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8643248" data-originallang="en">Canada will continue to work with UNRWA and other donors to ensure they implement the 50 recommendations of the review headed by former foreign minister Catherine Colonna. The review also found that UNRWA had sound governance and stronger neutrality mechanisms than other UN organizations. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8643249" data-originallang="en">Canada's assistance is subject to our robust enhanced due diligence process to ensure that no funding is diverted. We assess UNRWA to be an indispensable partner in aid delivery in Gaza during this dire humanitarian crisis.</p>
