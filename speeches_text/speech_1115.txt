<p data-HoCid="6791925" data-originallang="en">I maybe just want to clarify that the importance of having democratic elections take place, where they can take place in the West Bank, involves a system whereby whoever wins that election isn't able to take complete control through an armed takeover. That's essentially what happened in Gaza previously. Hamas, after winning one election, made sure there were no subsequent elections taking place.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791926" data-originallang="en">According to the Israeli military, of the 4,340 rockets fired by Hamas, close to 700 of them landed in the Gaza Strip, destroying infrastructure, injuring hundreds and killing dozens. Does Canada have estimates about how many Hamas rockets landed in Gaza and the impact of these rockets on Palestinian civilians?</p>
