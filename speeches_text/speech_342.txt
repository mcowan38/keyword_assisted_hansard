<p data-HoCid="6330706" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Mr. Minister. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6330707" data-originallang="en">My main concern, of course, is the safety of sex workers and their ability to support their families during COVID.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6330708" data-originallang="en">Can I turn quickly, in the very little time we have left, to the rise of online hate and in particular to the rise of anti-Semitism during COVID? It's is a very unfortunate sidebar that we have to deal with.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6330709" data-originallang="en"> In a previous Parliament, this committee tabled a report called “Taking Action to End Online Hate”, which I don't believe the government ever officially responded to. That report called for reinstating section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which would allow people to file complaints about online hate with the Canadian Human Rights Commission.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6330710" data-originallang="en">I wonder if the minister has a response to that specific part of the justice committee's recommendation.</p>
