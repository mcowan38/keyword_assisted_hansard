<p data-HoCid="8284501" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8284502" data-originallang="en">You mentioned in your opening statements about Israel's right to defend itself. I think everyone around this committee understands that right is afforded to any nation-state around the world.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8284503" data-originallang="en">What I want you to help me understand is, in the destruction that's going on in Gaza and the catastrophe that we're all witnessing day by day, that's happening and being inflicted on the Palestinian people who live there, at what point does the Government of Canada's understanding of the right to defend itself transition?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8284504" data-originallang="en">Is Israel still meeting that defined right to defend itself with the destruction that's going on in Gaza right now?</p>
