<p data-HoCid="8576381" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I am deeply concerned for families in Lebanon who are fleeing for their lives, already rocked by death and grief as Netanyahu's extremist government pushes a ground offensive. I am distressed for families in Israel who have had to deal with rockets and missiles launched by Iran and Hezbollah, which is clearly a terrorist group, as recognized by Canadian law. I am heartbroken for Gaza and Palestinians, who are currently undergoing daily horror from Netanyahu's extremist government. However, the Liberal government has failed to take action. It has failed to impose a two-way arms embargo. It failed to impose strict sanctions on Netanyahu's war cabinet.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576382" data-originallang="en">Why has the government failed to take action and do its part to stop the escalation of conflict in the region?</p>
