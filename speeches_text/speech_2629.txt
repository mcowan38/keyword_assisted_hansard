<p data-HoCid="7957612" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Chair, I thank my hon. colleague for his excellent speech.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957613" data-originallang="fr">Unfortunately, the hon. member may not have heard that the bodies of two of the three Canadians we thought might have been taken hostage were found today. That means the Canadian dead now number seven. I believe it was an attack. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7957614" data-originallang="fr">Does my hon. colleague agree with me that it was an attack not only on Israel but on Canada, on the United States and on humanity?</p>
