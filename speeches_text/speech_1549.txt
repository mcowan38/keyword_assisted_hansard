<p data-HoCid="7125197" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125198" data-originallang="fr">Thank you for inviting me.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125199" data-originallang="fr">I'm sure you already know that hate crimes, radicalization and extremism are on the rise in Canada. As Jews, we are particularly concerned about this phenomenon.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125200" data-originallang="en">We Jews are particularly vulnerable to this rise in hate. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7125201" data-originallang="en">Statistics Canada's numbers from 2020 show that while Jews represent 1% of the Canadian population, we are the target of 62% of police-reported hate crimes targeting religious minorities—62%. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7125202" data-originallang="fr">As Canada's special envoy on preserving Holocaust remembrance and combatting antisemitism, Irwin Cotler, has said, we haven't seen this much Jew hatred since the end of the Second World War.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125203" data-originallang="en"> We are acutely aware of the threats to our safety. With hate against us rising, the sight of someone openly waving the Nazi flag, the Nazi symbol, on the steps of the Château Laurier during the truckers' convoy brought deep feelings of horror and fear to our community.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125204" data-originallang="fr">I will put it bluntly: When I see someone waving the swastika, what I understand is that this individual wants me, my children, my family and my community dead.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125205" data-originallang="en">There is nothing subtle about that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125206" data-originallang="en">Sadly, that was not the only instance of a hate symbol displayed openly during the truckers' demonstration, and the truckers' convoy was not the only instance of hate symbols being displayed openly on Parliament Hill.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125207" data-originallang="en">Now is the time to act. Now is the time to act swiftly, and it is time to act smartly. By “smartly”, I mean to say, for example, that the swastika we're talking about, the symbol that came to symbolize, as Bernie Farber said, hatred toward Jews was also, and is also, a sacred and holy symbol for Hindus, Buddhists and Jains.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125208" data-originallang="fr">Any decision to ban this symbol must also protect legitimate use of it, because a growing number of Canadians now see it a sacred symbol. I co-wrote an article about it with a witness who will be testifying a little later. It was published in a Canadian English-language newspaper.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125209" data-originallang="en">Some argue that waving Nazi symbols is already banned under hate speech legislation, and I agree with Bernie Farber on this. There is an argument for this position. However, clarifying this would be a good thing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125210" data-originallang="fr">We need to act swiftly and understand what leads people to brandish hate symbols, because simply banning them would be like putting a bandaid on an open wound.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125211" data-originallang="fr">Federal, provincial and municipal governments must work together effectively to fight hatred and radicalization. We need to understand what's behind them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125212" data-originallang="en">Somebody does not wake up one morning thinking, “Wow, I'm going to drive through downtown Ottawa waving a Confederate flag and a noose or a Nazi flag” and say that's a good thing. There's indoctrination behind this. We need to understand and work on that part as well.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125213" data-originallang="fr">I'd like to raise another important point. Hate is hate is hate, no matter what the source is.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125214" data-originallang="en"> Here, I take a bit of exception with the wording of the terms of reference for this study. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7125215" data-originallang="en">Much of the focus has been on hate symbols of white supremacist groups, and rightly so, but there are other groups that are very hateful. For example, Hamas and Hezbollah, groups that are banned in Canada, have been implicated in attacks on Jews, not just in Israel but around the world. Both are listed as terror organizations. Why do I bring them up? Their flags have been seen in the streets of Montreal, in front of Queen's Park and in front of this very Parliament.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125216" data-originallang="fr">When I see those symbols, those flags, I react the same way I would if I saw a Nazi flag: An individual waving those flags wants me, my children, my family and my community dead.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125217" data-originallang="fr">We must therefore say yes to banning hate symbols. It's one tool to add to a toolbox that needs a wider range of tools.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125218" data-originallang="fr">I hope to have the opportunity to continue this discussion during the question period.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7125219" data-originallang="fr">Thank you.</p>
