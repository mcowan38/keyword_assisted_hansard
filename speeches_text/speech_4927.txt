<p data-HoCid="8576842" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I voted against the NDP motion in March. That was one of the reasons I did so. I do not agree that there should be a restriction on licensing shipments to Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576843" data-originallang="en">A perfect example is that, today, Iranian rockets fell on Israel. It is an absurd idea that Israel is a friend and ally but that we would not give it the opportunity to defend itself against Iranian and Hezbollah rockets.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576844" data-originallang="en">I have called upon my government to rethink this restriction and to eliminate it, to make sure that our ally, Israel, is able to defend itself against the numerous terrorist organizations that are constantly threatening it. I will continue to do so. I have maintained the position that I advocated and that the hon. member, I know, agreed with back in March.</p>
