<p data-HoCid="8232106" data-originallang="en">In terms of the aftermath of this incident, of course this is having a great deal of impact on the Jewish communities in Canada. In meetings that I've had with them in my local area, many communities have been calling for your government's online hate legislation to be brought forward. It was promised to be brought forward within 100 days of your government coming to power. We have not seen that.</p>
