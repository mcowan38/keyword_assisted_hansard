<p data-HoCid="8714648" data-originallang="fr">Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714649" data-originallang="fr"> Ladies and gentlemen, as legal adviser for Global Affairs Canada, thank you for the invitation to appear before the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development to discuss Canada's contribution to the advancement of a two-state solution.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714650" data-originallang="fr">Let me begin by stating a few points of international law dealing with the recognition of a state. In customary international law, the constituent elements of a state include a permanent population, a defined or relatively defined territory, a sovereign government and independence from other states.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714651" data-originallang="fr"> That said, the application of these elements can pose challenges in specific factual situations. Existing states may have differing opinions as to whether the elements listed above are present in a particular case. It is up to each state to make its own assessment and decision on the matter. Moreover, even if these elements are present, there is no obligation for another state to recognize an entity as a state, as legal considerations are only part of the elements that influence this decision.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714652" data-originallang="fr">In the end, the decision on whether to recognize a state is a deliberate political act on the part of another state.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714653" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, in Canada the authority to recognize new states is exercised by the federal executive under its prerogative over the conduct of Canada's foreign relations. I would note that the approach to recognition is generally characterized by caution. Indeed, states extend recognition in order to remove uncertainty, not to create it.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714654" data-originallang="en">When Canada decides to recognize a new state, it does so clearly and expressly. The manner of the recognition is also a political decision and can take a variety of forms, such as the exchange of diplomatic communication, an official statement by the government and other forms. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8714655" data-originallang="en">Moreover, the level of political, diplomatic, trade, economic or other engagement that Canada may decide to have with the state that it recognizes is also a political decision. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8714656" data-originallang="fr">My colleague Ms. Netley and I thank you for your attention. We look forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714657" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Chair.</p>
