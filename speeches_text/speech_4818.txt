<p data-HoCid="8576911" data-originallang="en"> Madam Speaker, first of all, I want to say to the member for <a data-HoCid="278248" href="/politicians/michelle-rempel/" title="Michelle Rempel">Calgary Nose Hill</a> that I appreciate her advocacy, and I know the entire Jewish community right across the country appreciates her advocacy and her steadfast support when times are good and when times are bad.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576912" data-originallang="en">I have one simple question for her that I hope she can answer for the House: Why does she do it?</p>
