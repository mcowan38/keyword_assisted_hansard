Certainly, we have a good working relationship with those communities. There's only so much communities can do at a certain level. As I said, in terms of our desire to work together for April—genocide remembrance month—we've had much co-operation in the past with all sorts of partners involved in that. We look forward to continuing to work with them. </p>
