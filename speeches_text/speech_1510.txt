<p data-HoCid="7019458" data-originallang="en"> Last, when you talk about moon shots in the context of climate change, you point to CARPA. CARPA is many months away, many years probably, if we're being honest, and it's only a government endowment of $2 billion, if we follow through on our platform. You have $8 billion sitting there today in the net-zero accelerator. Have you turned your mind to taking a portion of that $8 billion and directing it specifically to high-risk, high-reward moon shots?</p>
<p data-HoCid="7019459" data-originallang="en">I'll just give one example. A recent IPCC report identifies alternative sources of protein for food and feed. It says alternative protein sources for human food and livestock feed are receiving considerable attention. Lab or “clean meat” is one potential contributor to the human demand for protein in the future. That's obviously a high-risk, high-reward initiative. It's one that the U.S., Singapore and Israel are all pursuing. Canada is not, unfortunately, at the moment. Entrepreneurs are leaving the space in Canada, unfortunately.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7019460" data-originallang="en">I wonder if you would turn your mind to high-risk, high-reward research via the net-zero accelerator.</p>
