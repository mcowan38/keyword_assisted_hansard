<p data-HoCid="6865327" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, my question is to the <a data-HoCid="278929" href="/politicians/pablo-rodriguez/" title="Pablo Rodriguez">Minister of Canadian Heritage</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6865328" data-originallang="en">In my riding of Spadina—Fort York, people have raised concerns about the rise of racism in our community. They are worried about the violence and harassment they are witnessing online and in person. As someone of Asian heritage, anti-Asian hate is a sad reality. Many of my neighbours in Spadina—Fort York also know this far too well. That is unacceptable, but whether it is anti-Asian racism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia or any form of hate, hate is hate, and any strategy developed must eradicate this whenever and wherever it rears its ugly head.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6865329" data-originallang="en">Could the <a data-HoCid="278929" href="/politicians/pablo-rodriguez/" title="Pablo Rodriguez">minister</a> update the House on the vital work in combatting racism and anti-Asian hate?</p>
