<p data-HoCid="7602239" data-originallang="en">Let me just come now to another issue I have to get into because it's important. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7602240" data-originallang="en">Does the new contract incorporate the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism? Does either the attestation or the new contract require applicants to subscribe to the government's anti-racism strategy, which incorporates, by definition, the IHRA definition? </p>
