<p data-HoCid="6286928" data-originallang="en"> I have no problem with the spirit of this motion in terms of making sure that the good work we do through the national housing strategy, and in particular the rapid housing initiative, is publicized and promoted and shared publicly with this committee, with Canadians, with Parliament, with whoever needs to know the work we're doing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6286929" data-originallang="en">That being said, the member has outlined six one-hour meetings, with a seventh meeting, and wants them all within the first couple of weeks of the program rolling out. While we will be moving as quickly as we can to get this money to the front lines in the fight against homelessness, in particular as it relates to COVID, and in particular in cities with high COVID counts, Winnipeg is also one of them. The focus simply on Toronto and Vancouver is not a national approach that I support. I think we need to take a look at where the science directs us, where the housing point-in-time counts direct us. The cities with programs stepping up with opportunities with large shelter populations also have to be taken into account. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6286930" data-originallang="en">I have no problem referring this to the subcommittee for scheduling. I have no problem having the minister appear to talk about the good work we're doing and the good work we still need to do on top of this to eliminate chronic homelessness. I just think the timetable is heavy at the front end and requires some scheduling. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6286931" data-originallang="en">MP Kent has already said that we have estimates coming, and this would pre-empt those ministers from showing up for those meetings. I think it's a little premature to schedule it in the way you've done it. I totally support the spirit of this and look forward to.... I think the subcommittee should take this motion and work it into a schedule and bring it back, in balance with the other challenging and competing interests we have, which include, of course, the estimates. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6286932" data-originallang="en">On the issue of how this relates to the issue we have prioritized, which is urban, rural and northern housing, we know that the communities with the highest population counts in terms of homeless people count amongst them the highest concentration and the overrepresentation of indigenous people. We need to get support and programs, and we need to get investments into this particular stream of housing with an urgency that I can't understate. It is long overdue, and if you don't believe me, take a walk through MP Gazan's riding and understand the impact over the last six months of not acting quickly on this file.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6286933" data-originallang="en"> I absolutely urge us, in the spirit of Mr. Vis's motion, to take it to the subcommittee, on scheduling; get this committee to focus in on getting accountability and the reporting out on that. We have already missed half a year in terms of advancing the work on the urban, rural and northern housing strategy. We cannot ask this group of Canadians to wait for any longer. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6286934" data-originallang="en">The good news is that the rapid housing initiative will work well to achieve priorities in that segment as we work on fine tuning exactly what the federal approach should be doing for housing individuals in this area. I think that the timetable—and once you see the program as it gets rolled out, I think you'll understand it even more—is a little aggressive on the front end. There will be little to report in the first couple of days. We've already had two one-hour meetings before perhaps even the dollars have started to flow, and that doesn't make any sense. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6286935" data-originallang="en">I would urge my committee members to refer this to the subcommittee. We will report back to Mr. Vis, and work with Mr. Vis as a critic, to make sure he understands how to get the best results from the motion he's moved.</p>
