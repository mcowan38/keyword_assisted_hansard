<p data-HoCid="8003905" data-originallang="en">To the committee, through you, Mr. Chair, I'm seeing the members of the Liberal Party and the NDP member consistently interrupting me and finding fault with the fact that I'm talking about Ms. Tait, the head of the CBC, coming to this committee. That is the very core of the subamendment that we're talking about.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8003906" data-originallang="en">On the one hand, I am being berated by my colleagues at this table for talking about Ms. Tait coming to this committee and how that's so important, and then I'm also being berated, on this other side, for needing to stick to the subamendment. So here I am stuck in this interesting place, which brings me to the conclusion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8003907" data-originallang="en">This is just a nonsensical way for the Liberal and NDP members of this committee to try to stop the discussion, to try to stop my comments, because they do not want the truth to be told. They do not want the truth exposed. They do not want to acknowledge that the CBC is spreading disinformation that is dangerous in nature. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8003908" data-originallang="en">The CBC published an article with this title, “Hundreds killed in Israeli airstrike on Gaza City hospital, Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza says”. Let's be clear. The Palestinian health ministry is run by Hamas, so for the CBC to release an article with intel that they received from Hamas is absolutely inappropriate. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8003909" data-originallang="en">It was found, and has been confirmed by the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> of Canada, the <a data-HoCid="300003" href="/politicians/bill-blair/" title="Bill Blair">Minister of National Defence</a>, the Canadian Forces intelligence command, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and France that this is a false narrative the CBC has been spreading. It is in fact dangerous disinformation that feeds into anti-Semitism in this country. It is wrong, and this committee has the responsibility to hold the CBC leadership to account. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8003910" data-originallang="en">For the members of this committee to try to backstop the leader of that organization is absolutely horrendous. It's despicable. This is the spreading of dangerous disinformation that has had a massive impact on people in Canada. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8003911" data-originallang="en">We're talking about a public broadcaster that is paid to the tune of $1.4 billion from the Canadian taxpayer. Surely this committee can do its job, and surely the members of the Liberal caucus and the member of the NDP caucus who are trying to disrupt at this committee could perhaps have the decency— </p>
