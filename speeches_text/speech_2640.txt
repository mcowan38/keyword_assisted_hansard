<p data-HoCid="7957670" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, as I said in my speech, it is really important that all parties to a conflict have the responsibility to abide by international law. International law is very clear. Civilians must be protected and must not be the targets.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957671" data-originallang="en">The situation right now is very dire. There are serious shortages of food and water. If there is no water, there is is no life in Gaza. Hospitals have run out of vital supplies, so it is very important that all efforts are made.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957672" data-originallang="en">As the <a data-HoCid="300012" href="/politicians/ahmed-hussen/" title="Ahmed Hussen">Minister of International Development</a> has cited this morning, all of the humanitarian aid should be directed toward the civilians who do not have any food or water.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957673" data-originallang="en">The innocent civilians of Gaza must not be the victims of this conflict.</p>
