<p data-HoCid="7957399" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Chair, I want to thank my hon. colleague for her very touching speech. I think it moved us all, no matter which party we represent in this House.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957400" data-originallang="fr">Canada was one of the first countries to announce humanitarian aid, and I congratulate the government on that announcement. Now it is time to deliver that humanitarian aid. If there is no humanitarian corridor, this aid will not get to the people we want to offer it to, the people we want to help. That is why it is so important to have a humanitarian corridor into the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957401" data-originallang="fr">How does the Canadian government plan to ensure that this humanitarian corridor is put in place?</p>
