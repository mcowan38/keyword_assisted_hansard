<p data-HoCid="7789257" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7789258" data-originallang="en">My name is Jan Willem Cohen Tervaert. I'm a professor of medicine at the University of Alberta and also emeritus professor in medicine and immunology of Maastricht University in the Netherlands. Currently I'm also a member of the expert panel on medical devices of the European community.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7789259" data-originallang="en">I did my training and education in the Netherlands, but after finishing my M.D. and Ph.D., I was invited to work at Harvard University in Boston in the United States. In 1993, I returned to the Netherlands on a fellowship from the Netherlands academy of science.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7789260" data-originallang="en">At that time, I started my clinics for patients with autoimmune complaints associated with breast implants. Based on this experience, I am pleased to share with members of the Standing Committee on Health some background information on the safety or “unsafety” of breast implants.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7789261" data-originallang="en">First of all, there have been several scandals with breast implants. Breast implant products are not always in compliance with international norms and standards. For example, there were three scandals: in 2010 with the Poly Implant Prothèse, PIP, from France; in 2015 with Silimed, a company from Brazil; and in 2021, BellaGel from Korea. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7789262" data-originallang="en">Furthermore, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment published in 2015 a market surveillance study that demonstrated that the technical findings for all 10 manufacturers that have a market for breast implants in the Netherlands were not in order, and in one case there was even a very high level of contaminants in the breast implants.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7789263" data-originallang="en">Finally, in 2018, as is well known, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists released the “Implant Files”, demonstrating many shortcomings in breast implant clinical trials.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7789264" data-originallang="en">Currently what diseases are associated with breast implants? There are three different types. First is the malignant disease. In 1997, specific implant-associated malignant disease was first reported, so-called anaplastic large cell lymphoma: BIA-ALCL. Based on the Dutch mandatory registry for pathology specimens, Daphne de Jong et al. demonstrated clearly already in 2008 that BIA-ALCL in the Netherlands was caused by breast implants.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7789265" data-originallang="en">In 2011, the FDA issued a warning but stated that it was not possible to identify a possible association between breast implants and BIA-ALCL. Since most patients with ALCL had textured implants, the FDA and Health Canada requested that Allergan in 2019 recall its textured implants.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7789266" data-originallang="en">More recently, in 2023, the FDA and Health Canada issued a safety communication that also other lymphomas and breast implant-associated squamous cell carcinoma may occur in patients with breast implants. Although an accurate estimation of how often these malignant tumours occur in patients with SBI does not exist, ALCL researchers calculate the risk to be one in 2,832 women.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7789267" data-originallang="en">Apart from malignancies, there are also various autoimmune diseases that are reported to occur more frequently in patients with breast implants. Also, here the estimated risk is very difficult to quantify, and it was for a long time debated whether breast implants were even really a risk factor for the development of these autoimmune diseases.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7789268" data-originallang="en">In 2018, however, a very large study from Israel convincingly demonstrated that autoimmune diseases occur more often in patients with breast implants than in women without these implants. Patients with breast implants appear to have a 45% higher risk of developing autoimmune diseases such as sarcoidosis, systemic sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. Just as has been found for malignancies, most diseases occur more than 10 years after the implantation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7789269" data-originallang="en">Finally, there's a third group of diseases. Patients with breast implants often have symptoms suggestive of an abnormally functioning autonomous nervous system. Symptoms that these women have include severe fatigue, widespread pain in muscles and joints, severe dry eyes, severe dry mouth, feverish feelings and cognitive impairment.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7789270" data-originallang="en">Nowadays this disease is called breast implant illness or autoinflammatory/autoimmune syndrome induced by adjuvants due to silicone incompatibility. The symptoms also occur, generally, seven to 10 years after the breast placements, and in 80% of the cases there is an amelioration or disappearance of the symptoms after explantation. Although an accurate estimation of how often this occurs does not exist, our studies suggest that one in four women, so 25%, may develop at least three symptoms, suggestive of this disease, 10 years after breast implants.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7789271" data-originallang="en">Why do we need a national breast implant registry? It is estimated that about 3% to 4% of women in western countries have breast implants. About 70% are placed because of cosmetic reasons, whereas 30% are placed because of a reconstruction after a mastectomy. When the PIP implants were recalled in the Netherlands, there was only a voluntary registration, a so-called opt-in registration, and this meant that only 10% to 20% of the women with PIP implants could be traced.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7789272" data-originallang="en">Furthermore, with a registry, there's a possibility to calculate how often local and systemic complications really occur after a breast placement.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7789273" data-originallang="en">Since there were never randomized and controlled clinical trials performed to demonstrate the possible safety, or unsafety, of breast implants before they were registered, we currently only have post-marketing surveillance to monitor their safety. Manufacturers need to conduct these studies, and plastic surgeons need to report events to the manufacturers. Unfortunately, there are no criteria for these reports. Reports are only infrequently made by surgeons. The reports are not peer-reviewed, and they are not open to the public.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7789274" data-originallang="en">Because there are several signals that breast implants may not always be safe, it is prudent to start with a registry as soon as possible. As discussed, this should not be a voluntary opt-in registry, but a mandatory opt-out registry, where only the patient, and not the surgeon, has the choice to participate or not.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7789275" data-originallang="en">What are the requirements for a registry?</p>
