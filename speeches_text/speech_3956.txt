<p data-HoCid="8347869" data-originallang="fr"> In fact, we already have a rapid reaction force. For example, last fall, after the attack in Israel, we deployed a rapid reaction force to the Middle East to evacuate noncombatants if needed. We now have a team in Haiti to support the embassy, which was deployed quickly. So we now have a team that can be deployed anywhere in the world if necessary.</p>
