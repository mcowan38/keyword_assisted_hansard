<p data-HoCid="6445932" data-originallang="en"> Good morning, everyone. I call this meeting to order.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6445933" data-originallang="en">Welcome to meeting number 10 of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. Today's meeting is taking place in a hybrid format pursuant to the House order of September 23. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6445934" data-originallang="en">The proceedings will be made available via the House of Commons website. Just so that you are aware, the webcast will always show the person speaking rather than the entire committee. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6445935" data-originallang="en">I'd like to give the members an update on the schedule because we've had some changes. If you'll bear with me, I'd like to provide that to you. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6445936" data-originallang="en">For the INDU members, as you know we passed the motion on Tuesday last week. Just so that you know, all four witnesses have accepted the invitation to appear. The problem has been scheduling. The clerk and I have been working on this since the minute the motion passed. Right now this is where we stand. Again, I'm assuming that INDU is going to be sitting on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 11 o'clock to 1 o'clock in the new year, but things may change. I want you to bear that in mind. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6445937" data-originallang="en">Right now, with respect to the vaccine manufacturing study, we have the PHAC president for Tuesday, January 19. This is an added meeting date if we can get authorization for a hybrid sitting. We also have <a data-HoCid="253395" href="/politicians/patty-hajdu/" title="Patty Hajdu">Minister Hajdu</a> for Tuesday, January 19, on that added meeting dateâ€”again if we get authorization for a hybrid sitting. <a data-HoCid="253394" href="/politicians/navdeep-bains/" title="Navdeep Bains">Minister Bains</a>, unfortunately, was not available this Thursday and we couldn't move our INDU time slot. We were even trying to see if we could switch with another committee or even add another time slot this week, which wasn't possible, unfortunately, but he's given us three meeting dates when he is available for the first three meetings when we're back in January. <a data-HoCid="253382" href="/politicians/anita-anand/" title="Anita Anand">Minister Anand</a> is scheduled for Thursday, January 28. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6445938" data-originallang="en">With respect to the affordability and accessibility study, as you know, we had the representatives from Bell scheduled on December 1, but we had that Standing Order 106(4) meeting, so they had to be rescheduled. They are holding Tuesday, January 26, for them to come back.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6445939" data-originallang="en">I want to give you guys all of the information that I have. We've also, as I said, inquired with the clerk, the head clerk and the whips, about adding meetings next week, week of December 14. Negotiations amongst the parties are still ongoing, including discussions about extended hybrid sittings. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6445940" data-originallang="en">I've also let all of our witnesses know that, should we be able to add additional meetings outside of those dates, I will be back in touch with them to see if we can get them in sooner. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6445941" data-originallang="en">I wanted all of you to have the same information at the same time so that you can schedule accordingly. For any updates that we have, the clerk will definitely send you that as soon as we have it. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6445942" data-originallang="en">With that, I'd like to go over the rules for today's meeting. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6445943" data-originallang="en">Members and witnesses may speak in the official language of their choice. Interpretation services are available for this meeting. You have the choice at the bottom of your screen of the floor, or English or French. For members participating in person, please proceed as you usually would with the whole committee meeting in person in the committee room. Keep in mind the directives from the Board of Internal Economy regarding masking and health protocols. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6445944" data-originallang="en">Before speaking, please wait until I recognize you by name. If you're on the video conference, please click on the microphone icon to unmute yourself. For those in the room, your microphone will be controlled as normal by the proceedings and verification officer. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6445945" data-originallang="en">I remind you that all comments by members and witnesses should be addressed through the chair and that your mike should be on mute when you are not speaking.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6445946" data-originallang="en">With regard to the speaking list, the committee clerk and I will do our best to maintain the order of speaking for all members. If there are any changes, please notify the clerk and he will notify me accordingly. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6445947" data-originallang="en">As is my normal practice, you will see the yellow card when you have 30 seconds remaining in your intervention, and I will wave the red card for when the time for your intervention is up. I ask that you please respect the time limits so that all of the members can get their questions in. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6445948" data-originallang="en">The House of Commons Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology is meeting today to continue its study on the accessibility and affordability of telecommunications services in Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6445949" data-originallang="en">I'd now like to welcome our witnesses, and for the sake of time I won't read all of your titles, because they are in the notice of meeting.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6445950" data-originallang="en">From the Canadian Communications Systems Alliance, we have Mr. Jay Thomson and Mr. Ian Stevens; from the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, Mr. John Lawford; from the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association, Mr. Robert Ghiz and Mr. Eric Smith; from TekSavvy Solutions, Mr. Andy Kaplan-Myrth; from FSET Information Technology, Mr. David Brown; and from the Samuelson-Glushko Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic, Mr. Tamir Israel.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6445951" data-originallang="en"> With that, each witness will present for up to five minutes, followed by our rounds of questions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6445952" data-originallang="en">We will start with the Canadian Communication Systems Alliance. You have the floor for five minutes.</p>
