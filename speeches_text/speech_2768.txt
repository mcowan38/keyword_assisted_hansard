<p data-HoCid="7959661" data-originallang="en">On Monday, we announced the appointment of Ms. Deborah Lyons as Canada's special envoy on preserving holocaust remembrance and combatting anti-Semitism. As she stated, she will work closely with her counterpart, the special representative on combatting Islamophobia, to support both communities during this difficult time when feelings of anxiety, tension and fear are on the rise.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7959662" data-originallang="en">Diversity is at the core of who we are as Canadians. We all need to be united in standing up against hate and intolerance whenever and wherever.</p>
