<p data-HoCid="7983344" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much for that, Sean.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7983345" data-originallang="en">First and foremost, as indicated, actually the directive did not come from the department. I want to be clear. A directive was put forward by the chaplain general of DND. Let's be absolutely clear: In no way did that directive ban prayer at all. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7983346" data-originallang="en">To the contrary, the directive simply indicated that they wanted to ensure that when the chaplains did their public address, they made sure they were inclusive. It was to make sure that the veterans, the people and the members of the Canadian Armed Forces who were there felt reflected in the spiritual prayers that were made.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7983347" data-originallang="en">As such, I actually have a quote here that I want to read for the record. Chaplains shall “endeavour to ensure that all feel included and able to participate in the reflection...no matter their beliefs.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="7983348" data-originallang="en">I really have to believe that all Canadians would agree with that directive.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7983349" data-originallang="en">I know that when I'm in Moncton, New Brunswick and I attend my Remembrance Day ceremonies, where we have the chaplain and someone from the Jewish faith and someone who gives us a moment of reflection. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7983350" data-originallang="en">We simply want to make sure that all Canadians who are attending the Remembrance Day events—this is the directive that was provided by the chaplain general, I should qualify that—feel a part of these services.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7983351" data-originallang="en">In no way is anyone saying that prayer is not allowed. It's to the contrary. </p>
