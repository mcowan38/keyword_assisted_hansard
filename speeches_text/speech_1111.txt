<p data-HoCid="6791907" data-originallang="en">Isn't that preventing Palestine from becoming a state, the element of international co-operation and acceding to international norms? We urge that on all sorts of states or entities we aren't happy with. Surely, acceding to statehood expects responses from them as individuals and as a government as well, so this is something that is positive in nature, is it not, instead of exclusive? Should it not be a force for positive instead of exclusion...?</p>
