<p data-HoCid="8025073" data-originallang="en"> I think that's a very insightful question, Mr. Housefather. What I would say to you is that we've had to put some demarcations around the structure of the commission. Also, I, as well as the drafters in the department, was very conscious of not usurping the proper role of the courts in terms of making determinations. This is not meant to replace determinations of convictions, etc. It's not meant to usurp the proper judicial role. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8025074" data-originallang="en">I hear you on the access to justice point about who's able to pursue an appeal in the first instance within the time frames that are allowed. One way I think we can work to address that is by ensuring we have robust legal aid. This was mentioned, I think, by Ms. Gazan. What I would say to you there is that there's always room for improvement, but I'm particularly content with the fact that I think this year, if my memory serves correctly, over $200 million was provided by the federal government on an annual basis to support legal aid around the country.</p>
