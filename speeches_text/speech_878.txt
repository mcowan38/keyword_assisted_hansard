<p data-HoCid="6651947" data-originallang="en">We know that the Europeans did a temporary export transparency and authorization mechanism. It's a protectionist mechanism—we know that—even if it's temporary. I believe the pandemic is also temporary. On the other side, we see India and South Africa asking for a waiver, with push-back from the industries for sure, and also some intellectuals' opinions and some business opinions on the waiver and protectionism. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6651948" data-originallang="en">In Canada we have a history of not being able to protect intellectual property, and we have been losing big deals on businesses, on opportunities. We must remind ourselves that we are leaders on many fronts, whether on a pharmaceutical front or technological fronts or others, but we seem to be failing. We do have a shortage of supply in Canada now. There are delays on the purchase orders we have in place. It could be related to shortages in manufacturing or struggles on the manufacturing side, but at the end of the day, it's affecting us. It's standing in the way of opening our economy as early as other countries, such as the United States, Israel and others.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6651949" data-originallang="en">Mr. Sorenson, you have the technology. You have the capacity. You've been talking to the government. I was a businessman before I entered political life. How can the government work better with you? This is very critical. Having security over our supplies at all levels is very important, and especially now with the pandemic. How do you see that the government has been working with you? What would you like to see changed in order to be able to have the capacity we need?</p>
