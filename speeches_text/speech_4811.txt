<p data-HoCid="8564768" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, over 600 civilians have been killed by Israeli air strikes in Lebanon in recent days. Among them are two Canadians. I send my condolences to the loved ones of all those lost. I represent a large Lebanese Canadian community, and its members are deeply worried for their families and loved ones. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8564769" data-originallang="en">Israeli officials say they are ready for a ground invasion that will kill even more innocent civilians. Civilians are dying in Gaza, in the West Bank and in Lebanon. The violence must end. The Netanyahu government must stop its escalations. Canada's words are not enough. There must be a ceasefire and consequences for Israeli government officials who have expressed support for genocide and violence.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8564770" data-originallang="en">We need a clear and unequivocal two-way arms embargo with no loopholes. As part of a two-state solution, Canada must recognize the Palestinian state now. We must stand for peace.</p>
