<p data-HoCid="6708415" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, violence has erupted in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. Hamas has fired thousands of rockets into civilian areas, demonstrating its obvious intent to kill as many Israeli citizens as possible. This, along with deliberatively setting up bases in civilian areas using Palestinian civilians as human shields, constitutes war crimes.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6708416" data-originallang="en">The <a data-HoCid="271244" href="/politicians/marc-garneau/" title="Marc Garneau">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a>' statements to date on this violence have been ambiguous at best. Will the minister state unequivocally today that he supports Israel's right to defend itself, just as President Biden has done?</p>
