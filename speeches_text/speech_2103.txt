<p data-HoCid="7602157" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair, for the question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7602158" data-originallang="en">There are very well-established procedures that were in place before the financials were looked at and the organization was looked at. Was it a first-time organization? A risk-based, comprehensive review of the applications is done. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7602159" data-originallang="en">What this case has brought to light is that while the contract itself was cancelled under the previous system, we wanted to make it much clearer, explicit, that individuals who espoused hate, racism or discrimination would not be eligible for funding. These additional requirements and training were brought in because it was new. Previously there was training for program advisers. This new training was specifically on the new criteria that we were piloting, along with additional training on anti-racism and anti-Semitism.</p>
