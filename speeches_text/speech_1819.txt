<p data-HoCid="7266522" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an important leader and friend who will soon be leaving our community.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7266523" data-originallang="en">Rabbi Mark Fishman has served as Beth Tikvah's rabbi since 2013.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7266524" data-originallang="en">Our synagogue in Dollard is home to one of the most vibrant Jewish communities in Canada, a community I am honoured to serve. Whether he was organizing family fun programs, such as the Purim carnival, bringing the synagogue's hanukkiah to the homes of the celebrating, delivering sermons and programs online during COVID, or recently travelling to Poland to assist Jewish refugees fleeing Ukraine, Rabbi Fishman's contributions and legacy are numerous.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7266525" data-originallang="en">I would like to thank the rabbi for his service to the West Island Jewish community and society at large. Our community is losing a great leader. I am looking forward to working with his successor, but I will miss our thoughtful conversations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7266526" data-originallang="en">I thank him for his years of service, and I really wish Mark and his family the very best.</p>
