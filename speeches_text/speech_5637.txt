<p data-HoCid="8763805" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair. I've seen this movie before, so it's nice to be here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8763806" data-originallang="en"> Thanks to my colleagues for welcoming me here. It's certainly an interesting experience sitting on this side of the table and not being able to use my own microphone.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8763807" data-originallang="en">I'm here today to tell you about my legislation, Bill <a data-HoCid="12566709" href="/bills/44-1/C-353/" title="An Act to provide for the imposition of restrictive measures against foreign hostage takers and those who practice arbitrary detention in state-to-state relations and to make related amendments to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act and the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act">C-353</a>, or the foreign hostage-takers accountability act. I think it will be an important asset for Canada in an uncertain world.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8763808" data-originallang="en"> Since this bill was introduced, I can confidently say that the world has become a much more dangerous and unstable place. Nations such as China, Iran and Russia are, more than ever, intent on disrupting the global world order and the established balance of power. We've seen that in aggressive invasions, like the one in Ukraine or the one perpetrated by Hamas in Israel. These are on the verge on exploding into regional and global wars. Our nation's values of peace, freedom and democracy are increasingly under siege.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8763809" data-originallang="en"> Throughout the history of global conflict, hostage-taking has been employed as a tactic. Its use is only growing. I mentioned that fact in the deliberations of the House on this bill. We saw it used prominently in the Hamas attack against Israel, even impacting Canadian citizens. That, of course, came after this bill was introduced, which proves again why its adoption, frankly, is probably overdue in this country. In a time of turmoil, we should do everything possible for Canadians travelling abroad when it comes to protecting them from hostile states, groups and individuals. It's clear that there is a deficiency in our current law. I think more can be done, and that's why I'm here today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8763810" data-originallang="en"> When lives and livelihoods are at stake, the value of comprehensive, up-to-date and modern legislation to prevent and mitigate hostage-taking situations cannot be overstated. This bill provides the much-needed update to fix the existing laws or at least add to them. It would strengthen our ability to deter, minimize and resolve instances of hostage-taking and arbitrary detention in state-to-state relations. It would increase our power to levy sanctions, support families and encourage global co-operation. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8763811" data-originallang="en">It would also provide much-needed assistance to the families of hostages, who endure extreme stress while their loved ones remain in captivity abroad. Simply put, it would be a vital tool in the arsenal, helping us to continue to protect the rights of Canadians abroad and support those affected by hostage-taking.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8763812" data-originallang="en"> Here is what it will not do, just to make it clear: It will not incentivize kidnapping or effect ransom payments to hostile entities, which I know has been suggested. It will not place too much power in the hands of individual federal ministers. It will not be rendered redundant by existing legislation. In short, there is a gap between what Canada could say and what Canada could do. This bill is brought forth with a desire to address the gap and help protect the rights and inherent dignity of Canadians wherever and whenever they might be in danger.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8763813" data-originallang="en"> Since introducing this bill, I've received questions from colleagues on all sides of the House. I'll take that for what it's worth. Maybe it's positive and shows proactive interest in this piece of legislation. I'm looking forward to addressing some of those questions here, as well as any additional questions that may arise from the testimony today.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8763814" data-originallang="en"> While there are, frankly, too many people to thank—because these things don't come together on their own—I have time today to name a few. I'm grateful for the support of many organizations and individuals, including Secure Canada, the Iranian Justice Collective, Muslims Facing Tomorrow, Hong Kong Watch, the Human Rights Action Group and the Uyghur Rights Advocacy Project. I hope it has your support, too, along with those groups.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8763815" data-originallang="en">Thanks, Mr. Chair.</p>
