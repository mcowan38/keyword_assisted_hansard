<p data-HoCid="8768725" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8768726" data-originallang="en">At our last meeting, we were debating a very important motion that the Liberals had put on the floor relating to the need to have a study regarding Gazan family members, the situation they are faced with and the inability for them to get to safety. We were in the midst of almost wrapping up that motion, and there were a number of amendments on the floor.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8768727" data-originallang="en">At the time, I moved an amendment for the production of documents, Mr. Chair, to which the Conservative MP Greg McLean moved an amendment to add that the production of documents include the period in which the Sudan special measures had come into play.</p>
