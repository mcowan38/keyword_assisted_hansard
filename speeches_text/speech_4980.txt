<p data-HoCid="8594903" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">minister</a> does relent, every single day, just like her <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">leader</a>. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8594904" data-originallang="en">I asked a very simple question. Mobs have taken to the streets in front of Jewish homes, hospitals and businesses to shout anti-Semitic hate slogans. I quoted a number of them and invited the <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">minister</a> to rise to her feet and specifically condemn them, to stand with Jews against the anti-Semitism that has been allowed to proliferate on our streets.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8594905" data-originallang="en">Once again, will she condemn these anti-Semitic chants?</p>
