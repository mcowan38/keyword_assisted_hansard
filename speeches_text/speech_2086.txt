<p data-HoCid="7494375" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I believe I stated in my previous response that our government has not done enough. We need to do more. We need to continue the partnerships with community groups. We need to continue the partnerships with other levels of government, including the City of Winnipeg. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7494376" data-originallang="en">Yes, I will work with the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>. We had a great working relationship when, together with other ministers, we delivered Velma's House, a 24-7 safe space for indigenous women and girls in downtown Winnipeg. I would be pleased to work with the member on finding other solutions to ongoing problems that, unfortunately, have been around too long. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7494377" data-originallang="en">We need to work in partnership to find those solutions, and I would be happy to sit down with the member to work toward solutions.</p>
