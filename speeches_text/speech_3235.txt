<p data-HoCid="8124795" data-originallang="fr">I'd like to comment on how we decide which way to vote.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8124796" data-originallang="fr">Votes on the situation in the Palestinian territories happen every year. There are usually 14 to 18 of them in any given year. Certain principles underlie our approach to this issue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8124797" data-originallang="fr">One of those principles is that the text of the resolution must comply with international law. It must reflect the current dynamics on the ground as well as the dynamics and attempts to politicize some of these resolutions, essentially the dynamics at UN headquarters in New York. We always try to support votes that encourage the pursuit of a two-state solution, votes that are just and that avoid unjustly isolating the State of Israel. Unfortunately, because of the dynamics on the ground, many of these resolutions target Israel unilaterally and unjustly.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8124798" data-originallang="fr">We have to weigh all those elements every year when we review our voting record. Sometimes small adjustments to the resolutions make it possible for us to go one way or the other. That, in a nutshell, explains why we vote a certain way.</p>
