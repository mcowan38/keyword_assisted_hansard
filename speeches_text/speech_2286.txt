I'm part of the Canadian delegation to that alliance, representing B'nai Brith. I'm on the access to archives project. We've done a lot of work in that area. There are some very elaborate and specific definitions. Because Canada is a member of the alliance, they normally comply with what that alliance has recommended.</p>
