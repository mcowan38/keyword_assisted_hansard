<p data-HoCid="6492815" data-originallang="en"> As the conversation continues now, I don't think the committee needs to be bound by a decision made two months ago. I think our consideration now should be on the basis of which study is most timely and which recommendations from the study would be most effective in addressing the very serious challenges we have with regard to EI and the fact that it's terribly outdated and has caused some huge disruptions regarding the transfer from the CERB to the CRB. Also, I think Mrs. Falk's and Ms. Chabot's resolutions do underline the fact that seniors have been among the biggest losers in the pandemic.</p>
