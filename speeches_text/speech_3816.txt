<p data-HoCid="8300565" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, I'd start by saying that, first of all, we have put a lot of effort into working with the Egyptian and Israeli authorities in submitting our list through COGAT to get the people out of Gaza. We do hear about people using different ways, including paying, and they are getting out. The Government of Canada is continuing to work with the authorities so that we can make an effort to bring them out. That is where our focus has been.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8300566" data-originallang="en">As such, we have not had success, as the minister pointed out. The folks who have actually come out have come out on their own. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8300567" data-originallang="en">In relation to anyone who is out and we see is trying to apply for a TRV, it is a process in which they will not be captured through the public policy because they don't have a code. However, this is a flexibility and an authority that is vested in our officers, who are actually taking into consideration the humanitarian and the compassionate part of it. They are certainly looking at it on a case-by-case basis and are very much leaning forward to make sure that we can actually provide an easy access through a TRV. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8300568" data-originallang="en">Again, as I said, this is not carte blanche, but is being done case by case. Our officers have the ability to use the compassionate and humanitarian situation as they see fit and do that. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8300569" data-originallang="en">Finally, to your point, as a question was asked through you, Mr. Chair, our focus has really been to figure out how we can best support the community that is trapped in Gaza through our diplomatic and bureaucratic effortsâ€”</p>
