<p data-HoCid="7747806" data-originallang="en">Your amendment is admissible because of the acceptance of the amendment to the preamble that was adopted on Tuesday, April 25. Your amendment today to the preamble is consistent with the clause change that was adopted earlier by the committee. It is admissible, so we'll open the floor for debate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7747807" data-originallang="en">Ms. Saks, you have the floor.</p>
