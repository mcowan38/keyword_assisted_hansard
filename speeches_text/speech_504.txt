<p data-HoCid="6438361" data-originallang="en"> I disagree that there is a chill because of doubt. I have no doubt about what conduct is being captured. It is quite clear what is meant, and that is coercive and harmful behaviour aimed at queer and two-spirit folks in order to change them into something they are not.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6438362" data-originallang="en">Supportive conversations are not captured. Conversations at the supper table or in the temple or the synagogue are not going to be captured. What are going to be captured are coercive programs of force and oppression, whether or not those are secular or religious.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6438363" data-originallang="en">I think this is well within a valid exercise of Parliament's criminal power. For the protection of Canadians we ban many things. We ban many kinds of conversations, like threats and hate speech. We ban many kinds of behaviour like assault and sex assault.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6438364" data-originallang="en"> In my respectful opinion, conversion programs are akin to those kinds of assaults and trespass and ought to be banned. The court will have no problem sorting out what is meant and what is not.</p>
