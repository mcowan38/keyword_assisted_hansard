<p data-HoCid="7494473" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I think that is an excellent question because I was also taught that we cannot just throw money at problems and hope they go away. Some problems we can throw money at and they will go away, but life is not that simple.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7494474" data-originallang="en">Frankly speaking, we are not seeing money being spent in the right ways. One of the things that has been championed quite a bit by the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> is the idea of a red dress alert. Something like that, similar to what we have with the Amber Alert, could possibly save lives because it would quickly draw more attention.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7494475" data-originallang="en">We do know that the faster people go out looking for someone after they go missing, the better chance they have to come home alive and the better chance they have to have that case solved if they are, unfortunately, already missing.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7494476" data-originallang="en">Suggestions like that are meaningful, tangible suggestions that do not necessarily require a whole bunch of money. They just require will from the government to do so.</p>
