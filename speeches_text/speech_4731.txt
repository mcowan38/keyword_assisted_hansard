<p data-HoCid="8562203" data-originallang="fr">Madam Chair, the reason I asked for the floor earlier was precisely to add to what Ms. Gazan said about coercive control. I will come back to that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8562204" data-originallang="fr">We've been back and forth, both on the budget and on the last-minute change. We went from a subcommittee meeting to a public committee meeting. Madam Chair, I think you should consult with the vice-chairs more often. For example, with regard to what happened this summer, we should have been consulted on the budget.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8562205" data-originallang="fr">As for the last-minute change, I gave my consent by email for the subcommittee to hold a meeting. I wasn't consulted on the change. Madam Chair, I would remind you that I'm available for issues that are this important to the committee, be it for a summer meeting requiring a budget or for a change like this one. Some people had already agreed by email that we would have a subcommittee meeting first. When it comes to changes like these, I give you my full support, Madam Chair, and I hope to be consulted. I think that's important.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8562206" data-originallang="fr">I would like to say a word about coercive control, because I will come back to it. The idea for the study came from a Quebec National Assembly member from Québec solidaire, who worked on the report called “<em>Rebâtir la confiance</em>”, or “Rebuilding Confidence” in English. I've had discussions with representatives of the Parti Québécois. The former minister of status of women is my riding neighbour. This summer, I met with Liberal MPs who are also aware of the recommendations in the “<em>Rebâtir la confiance</em>” report.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8562207" data-originallang="fr">I retained two things from my experiences this summer. First, Quebec understood that partisanship had to be separated from the issue of violence against women. I have had discussions with all the political parties. Second, there seems to be unanimity in Quebec that there's an urgent need to address the issue of femicide. Quebec is asking us to take a serious look at the issue of coercive control. This goes beyond partisanship.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8562208" data-originallang="fr">For these reasons, when we debate upcoming studies, we'll see what happens. We can talk about it again. Starting on Wednesday, we have an important study to finish. If it had nothing to do with the subject at hand, it might be different. We saw that this summer, and that's why I came here, worked with you, Madam Chair, and prepared my questions for the witnesses. I did not want to be partisan, despite what happened in terms of procedure. I was ready to put my questions to the witnesses, because I recognize that this is an important issue. My study is directly related to the issue of femicide. Actually, it's not just my study, it's the committee's study, and it was requested by the Quebec National Assembly. I suggest we finish the meeting as constructively as possible.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8562209" data-originallang="fr">Madam Chair, I would like to remind you that I'm available to speak to you and that I want to work with you. You know how to reach me if you want to talk to me. I respectfully ask you to do so in order to advance this cause, so that the victims no longer lose out because the committee's work isn't moving forward.</p>
