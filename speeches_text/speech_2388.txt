<p data-HoCid="7836124" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7836125" data-originallang="en">Minister, you said that faith-based communities were not in your mandate letter. I'm looking at the December 16, 2021, mandate letter that is out on the web for the Minister of Heritage, and it says:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7836126" data-originallang="en"> As Minister, I expect you to include and collaborate with various communities, and actively seek out and incorporate in your work, the diverse views of Canadians. This includes women, Indigenous Peoples, Black and racialized Canadians, newcomers, faith-based communities, persons with disabilities, LGBTQ2 Canadians, and, in both official languages. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7836127" data-originallang="en">If you weren't aware that was in there, what I would say is that we've had 68 Christian churches burnt to the ground and multiple attacks on synagogues and places of worship. I would ask that your government take some action.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7836128" data-originallang="en">I'll turn over the rest of the questioning to my colleague Martin.</p>
