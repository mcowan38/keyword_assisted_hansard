<p data-HoCid="8705415" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair and honourable members of this committee, for allowing us an opportunity to make recommendations as part of your pre-budget consultations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8705416" data-originallang="en"> My name is Rizwan Mohammad, and I am joined today by my colleague, Sadaf Ahmed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8705417" data-originallang="en">Muslims comprise only about 5% of Canada's population, yet violent Islamophobia has resulted in more targeted killings of Muslims than in any other G7 country since 2017. This last year we've seen a massive spike in attacks on our community, including a massive surge of anti-Palestinian racism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8705418" data-originallang="en">We are encouraged by the commitment—certainly in words—of all major parties to name and to address Islamophobia with the seriousness it deserves. To that end, we are here to recommend common-sense ways in which we can continue to work together to challenge Islamophobia and uphold our commitments to civil liberties and human rights. These will be further expanded upon in a longer brief that will be sent to this committee.</p>
