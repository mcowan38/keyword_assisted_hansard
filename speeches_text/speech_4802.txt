<p data-HoCid="8563316" data-originallang="en">We need to see de-escalation right now from both Israel and Hezbollah. I spoke with leaders this week, including the King of Jordan and the UN Secretary-General, along with G7 allies, on the need for urgent de-escalation. Civilians need to be protected. This violence needs to stop. We need to move on a path toward regional stability and peace.</p>
