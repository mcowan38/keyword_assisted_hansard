<p data-HoCid="6863764" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, in my riding of York Centre and in communities across Canada and around the world, Jewish families are celebrating the festival of lights. It is a story of resilience and triumph against oppression. This year I am reminded of the dedication of our community, which has given up so much to love and protect the vulnerable and the elderly during these challenging times.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6863765" data-originallang="en">Hanukkah teaches us never to underestimate the power of a handful of dedicated people to change the world. Inspired by faith and perseverance then and so too today, the story of Hanukkah celebrates the faith and traditions of the Jewish people over centuries, a shining light of what freedom and diversity can and should look like in our society today. Diversity is a fact in our lives here in Canada. Inclusivity is a choice we make each and every day. It is a time to spread light and hope to everyone, and to keep the <em>ruach</em>, the spirit, of Hanukkah growing candle by candle each night.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6863766" data-originallang="en">On behalf of all of my constituents, I would like to wish all members of the House and all Canadians <em>Chag urim sameach</em>. Happy Hanukkah.</p>
