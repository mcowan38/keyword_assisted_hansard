<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, this morning, I am tabling three petitions in the House.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">The first one has to do with the rather horrendous story of a young man named Ahmad Manasra, who was arrested by Israeli forces in October 2015 when he was just 13 years old. After being found guilty of attempted murder in proceedings marred by allegations of torture, the young Ahmad Manasra was sent to prison, where he has remained ever since. What is more, he has been being held in solitary confinement since 2021.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="fr">UN human rights experts and Amnesty International are calling for him to be freed. The petitioners are calling on the Government of Canada to request that Israel immediately free Ahmad Manasra.</p>
