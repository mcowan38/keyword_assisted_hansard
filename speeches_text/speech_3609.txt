<p data-HoCid="8276112" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I have great affection for my colleague. I want to reiterate that to her. I thank her for her work and her respect. I know that she is a great advocate for peace and solidarity, especially in times of crisis. I want to thank her for all her work.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8276113" data-originallang="fr">The government is very sensitive to this motion before Parliament. This motion is not perfect, but it is important. It seeks to offer a solution to this extremely devastating war, both on the Israeli side and the Palestinian side. Of course, Canada is engaged in a constructive dialogue to ensure, as she said so well, that we bring people into the country, denounce the humanitarian disaster in Gaza and, at the same time, ensure that the innocent Israeli victims, the hostages, are released.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8276114" data-originallang="fr">We will continue to work with all parliamentarians in the House. My colleague can count on my collaboration in coming up with a solution here in the House.</p>
