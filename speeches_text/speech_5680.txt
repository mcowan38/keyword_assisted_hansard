<p data-HoCid="8741975" data-originallang="en"> <em>Uqaqtittiji</em>, I rise knowing that today is International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. I have heard that there are Jewish people who are in solidarity with the Palestinian people, especially with respect to the genocide that is happening in Gaza. I wonder whether the member can speak to the voices she has heard of Jewish people who support the call for the end to the genocide in Gaza.</p>
