<p data-HoCid="8090937" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, Sudanese Canadians have been advocating since April for the government's definition of “immediate family member” to include siblings, parents and grandparents amidst escalating violence and reports of ethnic cleansing in Sudan. Now, Canadians with family in Gaza are living the same horror.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8090938" data-originallang="en">While I appreciate that the <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">minister</a> has rightfully admitted at committee that the definition “probably should be expanded”, nothing has yet changed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8090939" data-originallang="en">When will the minister fix the definition so Sudanese and Palestinian Canadians can bring their families to safety?</p>
