<p data-HoCid="8434934" data-originallang="en">Thank you very much for that question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8434935" data-originallang="en"> Look, I think one of the things that has become obvious, particularly since October 7—frankly, I felt it was obvious before I took the job— is that there's a lot of hard work to be done everywhere in our public service—federally, provincially, municipally—in businesses, in civil society and most certainly in the universities, as we've heard this morning and as you heard previously, to make sure that people understand anti-Semitism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8434936" data-originallang="en">We need to make sure that the right training is in place and that the IHRA definition is better understood and implemented. That is exactly what we're working on doing right now, both in my office and within the Department of Canadian Heritage. In every one of the ministries, we are looking at the training that they have in place. We are working with the Canada School of Public Service on ensuring that we have those training programs.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8434937" data-originallang="en"> You're quite right to point out that what we have now is sorely inadequate and has to change dramatically. I believe, sincerely, that we have the commitment of all ministers to make that happen. I can assure you we will, if we don't.</p>
