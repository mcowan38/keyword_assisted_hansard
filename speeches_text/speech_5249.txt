<p data-HoCid="8692006" data-originallang="en"> Well, perhaps they did. I know that Mr. Mendicino is a permanent member. Mr. Housefather was a permanent member, but is not now, and Ms. Dabrusin is not, but they are proud supporters of Israel, and I commend and I applaud all of their advocacy.

<p data-HoCid="8692010" data-originallang="en"> We all know how difficult it has been for the three of you in your caucus. You're telegraphed and been dispatched to go to certain parts of the country, voicing your support for Israel, while <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau</a>, your leader, sends out another team to talk aboutâ€”</p>
