<p data-HoCid="8734234" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8734235" data-originallang="fr"> Mr. Geist, as I said earlier, I have another question for you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8734236" data-originallang="fr">Following a demonstration during which the preacher Adil Charkaoui uttered words of extreme violence—he called for hatred and the elimination of Canada, the United States, but also Israel—my party, the Bloc Québécois, tabled a bill. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8734237" data-originallang="fr">It proposed amending the Criminal Code to remove what is known as the “religious exception”. This exception, I remind you, allows a person who speaks or expresses himself under the guise of his religious convictions to utter remarks that go beyond what might be deemed reasonable.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8734238" data-originallang="fr">Do you think this bill violates freedom of expression, and more specifically freedom of religion, depending on how you interpret it in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms or the Criminal Code?</p>
