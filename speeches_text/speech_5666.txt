<p data-HoCid="8726717" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I appreciate that the member listened to my speech, or at least part of it. That is a good thing. Maybe he missed the many public statements I made during the “freedom convoy” when I said protesters were illegally blocking the roads and it was not acceptable. The rest of it was peaceful, but that was not acceptable. When they blocked the bridges in Sarnia—Lambton, members will find me on the public record saying exactly the same thing. The rule of law has to apply equally to all. </p>
