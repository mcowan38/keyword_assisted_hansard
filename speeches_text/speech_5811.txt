<p data-HoCid="8778976" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, Canada voted yes on the UN General Assembly resolution entitled “Peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine”. Canada joined 156 other nations calling for Israel's complete withdrawal from the Palestinian territories. The resolution demanded that Israel comply with international law, cease all settlement activities and evacuate settlers from the occupied Palestinian territory. Canada's vote reaffirmed our long-standing policy calling for the realization of the rights of the Palestinian people, primarily the right to self-determination and the right to their independent state. Consistent with that policy, and to demonstrate support for the resolution, it is now time for Canada to recognize the state of Palestine.</p>
