<p data-HoCid="7004199" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7004200" data-originallang="en">Minister, welcome back to heritage committee. Owen, Isabelle and David, it's good to see you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7004201" data-originallang="en">I have a private member's bill, Bill <a data-HoCid="11535416" href="/bills/44-1/C-250/">C-250</a>, on holocaust denial. That's coming out very shortly. We've introduced it already. As you know, late April will be the one-hour debate in the House of Commons, so there's a start for you and maybe your committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7004202" data-originallang="en">Anyway, Minister, as you know, your government announced the new digital news tax credit in 2020, and digital subscriptions to local newspapers qualify for this credit. I got a $378 credit over the weekend from the Saskatoon Star Phoenix, which was nice.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7004203" data-originallang="en">Could you give the committee an update on the cost of this tax credit that you generously gave to the newspaper industry? Do you have an idea of the cost in the last couple of years?</p>
