<p data-HoCid="8090727" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, with the guns silenced, the bombs and missiles grounded, it was a ceasefire by any other name. For a few days, there was some sense of peace in Israel and Palestine, but now the killing has begun again in Gaza. Once again, innocent civilians, children and women are dying at a horrendous rate. Where is Canada? Where is the world? </p>
<p data-HoCid="8090728" data-originallang="en">We now say we are concerned about the number of Palestinian civilians killed. We hear the talk again of a two-state solution. How much of it is talk when the Prime Minister of Israel is telling Israelis that he is the only thing standing between them and a two-state solution?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8090729" data-originallang="en">Canada must be an unequivocal voice for peace and diplomacy. It starts with ending our complicity in the arms trade and in providing ongoing diplomatic cover for those who have no intention of supporting peace, security and justice for Palestinians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8090730" data-originallang="en">Have we not learned from history? This is a conflict that will repeat itself over and over again, unless there is a political solution.</p>
