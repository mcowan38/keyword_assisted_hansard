<p data-HoCid="6468322" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, it is Holocaust Memorial Day. We are asking the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> direct questions about a contemporary genocide and he is refusing to answer simple direct questions. Irwin Cotler, the government's own special envoy for Holocaust remembrance and combatting anti-Semitism, agrees that Canada must recognize and respond to this genocide.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6468323" data-originallang="en">Independent investigations have already been conducted. They have drawn on survivor testimony, satellite imagery and leaked Chinese government data. The evidence is clear, the investigations have been done and the victims have testified. The government should believe them. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6468324" data-originallang="en">Why is the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> still sitting on the fence and refusing to answer questions and recognize this genocide? </p>
