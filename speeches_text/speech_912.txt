<p data-HoCid="6655519" data-originallang="en"> As we have quorum and are past the time, I accordingly call this meeting to order.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6655520" data-originallang="en">I start with the acknowledgement that in Ottawa we meet on the traditional unceded territory of the Algonquin people. All of us have land acknowledgements in our various places. In my case, it would be Anishinabe, Haudenosaunee and Chonnonton first nations.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6655521" data-originallang="en">Pursuant to the order of reference from the House of April 19, 2021, and the motion adopted on February 25, 2021, the committee is commencing its study—well, it has actually been under way for some time—of Bill <a data-HoCid="11007812" href="/bills/43-2/C-15/" title="An Act respecting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">C-15</a>, an act respecting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and to make related and consequential amendments to other acts.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6655522" data-originallang="en">I will clarify to members that the cited motion has the effect of merging our previous subject matter study with this new one under the order of reference.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6655523" data-originallang="en">To ensure an orderly meeting, best practices include just selecting language of choice. At the bottom of your screen is the globe. Touching the globe, you will find English, French or floor audio. Select the language that you prefer. If you're changing language as you speak, there's no need to change that selection. The technology, hopefully, will pick that up.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6655524" data-originallang="en">When speaking, make sure that your video is on, and speak slowly and clearly.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6655525" data-originallang="en">Pursuant to the motion adopted on March 9, 2021, I inform the committee that everyone has completed a technical pretest.</p>
