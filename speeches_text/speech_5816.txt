<p data-HoCid="8817544" data-originallang="en">Israel has tremendous military tools and in some ways has now put the Middle East into a place where it needs more political tools. With the situation in Lebanon, for instance, you would hope to see the Lebanese armed forces be able to assert more control vis-Ã -vis Hezbollah and see an actual state-building process occur there. It would be similar in Syria. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8817545" data-originallang="en">That brings us to Iran. Where does Iran go from here? Right now, it's very much down. There's a real concern that Iran may see its weakness as necessitating a move toward a nuclear weapon or necessitating a potential opening for renewed talks with a Trump administration. I don't know if there'll be that appetite on the Trump administration's part. I think there is probably an opening where the Iranians are weak and would be willing to talk. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8817546" data-originallang="en">We'll see where Israel goes from there, because Israel will have a lot of influence, I think, over the course of direction of the Middle East and in U.S. policy toward Iran and the region. </p>
