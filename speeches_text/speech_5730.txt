<p data-HoCid="8792654" data-originallang="en"> I will respond in English this time. Hate crime is not defined in Canadian law per se, but there are four criminal offences in the Criminal Code that deal with hateful motivation. I talked a bit earlier about willful promotion of anti-Semitism, advocating genocide, public assignment of hatred and willful promotion of hatred. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8792655" data-originallang="en">What happens is that when an individual is accused and ultimately convicted under the Criminal Code, the Criminal Code requires that the court consider that the hateful motivation be used as an aggravating factor to address the sentence or the length of the sentence of the individual who's been convicted. </p>
