<p data-HoCid="6085519" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6085520" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Minister, Ms. Laurendeau, Mr. Pich√©, it is a pleasure to welcome you to our committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6085521" data-originallang="fr">In the last parliament, I had the pleasure of chairing the Committee on Justice and Human Rights. In that setting, we did a study on online hate. That study was requested by a number of groups, all over Canada, specifically in the Jewish, Muslim, and gay and lesbian communities. There were a number of groups in Quebec as well as in the other provinces. We considered the broad strokes of the problem.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6085522" data-originallang="en"> When we were coming out with recommendations, we came out with recommendations on education, on defining hate online, and making sure that we applied definitions across the board so we could properly track online hate. We suggested certain civil remedies that might be restored to the Canadian Human Rights Act. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6085523" data-originallang="en">One of our recommendations has found its way into your mandate letter, Mr. Minister, which relates to regulating online platforms. Now because we were doing a large study, we did not come out with specific recommendations related to monitoring online platforms. We simply said that was one of the tools we needed to use to tackle online hate. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6085524" data-originallang="en">Of course, when I'm speaking of online hate, what I'm speaking of are all of the elements that are criminalized in Canada, whether it's hate speech, solicitation of children online, etc., to encourage providers, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc., to take this down, take it offline. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6085525" data-originallang="en">Mr. Minister, I'm going to be proposing to the committee that we do a study on this issue. I am wondering, if this committee comes forward with serious recommendations, would you consider those recommendations when making the decision on how to proceed with the work that's given to you in your mandate letter? Maybe you could also share with us how you see this issue.</p>
