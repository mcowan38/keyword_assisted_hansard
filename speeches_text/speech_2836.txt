<p data-HoCid="7964019" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, let us talk about Amira Elghawaby, the Prime Minister's special representative on combatting Islamophobia.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7964020" data-originallang="fr">Many people noticed her long silence on the war between Israel and Hamas. Then, when she did finally break her silence after 10 days, everyone noticed that she did not say a word about the Hamas attacks, about the massacre of civilians, about the hundreds of kidnappings or the rapes. Many were hoping she would condemn those actions, but no, there was not even a mention.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7964021" data-originallang="fr">Ms. Elghawaby's role is to build bridges between communities. That is what is needed right now. Does the government think that she is building bridges this week?</p>
