<p data-HoCid="8829820" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8829821" data-originallang="fr">Ms. Baron, I thought I saw on your LinkedIn page that you speak French; I'll take advantage of that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8829822" data-originallang="fr">I won't make you repeat what you've already said, but I'd like to bring you to another topic addressed by Mr. Rousseau, which is the abolition of religious exceptions in the Criminal Code.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8829823" data-originallang="fr">Bill <a data-HoCid="12830843" href="/bills/44-1/C-373/" title="An Act to amend the Criminal Code (promotion of hatred or antisemitism)">Câ€‘373</a> has been introduced, and it provides for the repeal of paragraphs 319(3)(b) and 319(3.1)(b) of the Criminal Code. These are provisions that serve as a defence for hate speech or anti-Semitic speech, as long as it is based on a religious concept that we believe in and defend in good faith. In my opinion, the spread of hatred seems a bit difficult to accept as part of a religion. I would say that 99% of religions are based on love and communal harmony, not on the spread of hate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8829824" data-originallang="fr">Is it a good idea to abolish these defences of religious exception? I'd like to hear your thoughts.</p>
