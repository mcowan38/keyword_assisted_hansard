<p data-HoCid="8716962" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, November 20, is Universal Children's Day.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8716963" data-originallang="en">This is a day we recognize annually to promote and celebrate children's rights in Canada and worldwide. On this day, we recognize the Declaration of the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. These rights include the right to be protected from violence and discrimination and the right to life, health and education. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8716964" data-originallang="en">Today, there are delegations from UNICEF visiting parliamentarians, and I would like to salute the work of UNICEF and all child-focused organizations that take the time to educate us, as parliamentarians, about how to meaningfully improve children's lives. Over the last several years, we have seen absolute devastation for children in worldwide conflicts, including those in Ukraine, Palestine, Sudan and now Lebanon. International law and human rights are under attack, and children bear the brunt of these conflicts. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8716965" data-originallang="en">New Democrats will always stand for the rights of children. We will make space for children and young people to raise their voices on the issues that matter to them. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8716966" data-originallang="en">Happy Universal Children's Day.</p>
