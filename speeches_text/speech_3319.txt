<p data-HoCid="8139399" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Chair, before today's meeting, we had attempted to have a discussion with our government colleagues, and as the government has moved its motion, I am moving the following motion:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8139400" data-originallang="fr"> That, pursuant to Standing Order 108(2), the committee study diplomatic relations between India and Canada; that it allocate a minimum of four meetings to hear witnesses; and that the committee report its observations and recommendations to the House. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8139401" data-originallang="fr">We have also provided a copy of this motion in both official languages.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8139402" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Chair, since it is the wish of the committee, I will return to our witnesses.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8139403" data-originallang="fr">According to the recent report of the Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade, some former members of the Global affairs Canada legal affairs branch have expressed concerns about the loss of legal expertise at the department. We saw this last week when we asked questions about what was happening in Israel and Palestine. The government representatives were unable to tell us whether, in their opinion, what was happening constituted a violation of international humanitarian law.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8139404" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Imseis, do you feel there should be concerns about declining expertise in legal matters at the Department of Foreign Affairs?</p>
