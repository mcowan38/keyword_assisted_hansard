<p data-HoCid="8576412" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, we must address the unfolding crisis in Lebanon. It is crucial that the government condemn the horrific civilian casualties across Lebanon, Gaza and Israel, and Canada must do more to support peace in the region</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576413" data-originallang="en"> People in Lebanon are terrified. There are 45,000 Canadians, many of whom are unable to travel or to return to Canada as our country has offered limited evacuation assistance. I have heard directly from constituents who are hearing bombs ringing in their ears, and some cannot find flights out; they are being denied travel documents.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576414" data-originallang="en">We need to create pathways for families who are desperate to reunite with their family in Canada. Many have noted the difference between the government's response to those fleeing Gaza and to those fleeing Lebanon.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576415" data-originallang="en">Can the member speak to the need for an equally urgent response to those who are fleeing the conflict?</p>
