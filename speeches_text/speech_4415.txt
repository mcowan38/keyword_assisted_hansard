<p data-HoCid="8454071" data-originallang="en"> Minister, you're intervening on behalf of a criminal who has been convicted in Canada, but you won't intervene to make the process better for Sudanese or Gazan refugees. This is a choice you are making. Canadians and people who are waiting to get into Canada want to understand why you're making these choices.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8454072" data-originallang="en">Can you please explain to Parliament, to Canadians and to this committee why you've allocated resources to keeping criminals in Canada rather than to getting refugees into Canada?</p>
