<p data-HoCid="8414856" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, the University Network for Human Rights published a 100-page report concluding that Israel's actions in Gaza constitute genocide. The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor is now seeking arrest warrants for both Hamas terrorists and Israeli leaders. There is no equivalency being made. These individuals may simply be accused of breaking international law, which the court is tasked to uphold.</p>
