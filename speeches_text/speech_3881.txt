<p data-HoCid="8319998" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8319999" data-originallang="en">Given the conversations we have been having about uncertainty and about energy, I would like to move the motion that I submitted on Friday, April 5.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8320000" data-originallang="en"> I want to address the issue of LNG exports from Canada and talk a bit about why committee members here at the natural resources committee should support the motion to ask the <a data-HoCid="299995" href="/politicians/jonathan-wilkinson/" title="Jonathan Wilkinson">Minister of Natural Resources</a> to come to this committee to talk about the moral, political, geopolitical, security, sovereignty, energy and food poverty reasons that Canada should take the opportunity to provide LNG around the world, particularly to Canada's allies.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8320001" data-originallang="en">The motion I submitted on April 5 says:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8320002" data-originallang="en"> Given that, </p>
<p data-HoCid="8320003" data-originallang="en"> The Prime Minister of Greece recently stated that Greece would “of course” be interested in purchasing Canadian LNG, noting that Greece is “a big entry point for LNG, not just for the Greek market, but also for the Balkans, [and] for Eastern Europe,” and that “Theoretically, we could even supply Ukraine.” </p>
<p data-HoCid="8320004" data-originallang="en"> The leaders of Germany and Japan have made similar remarks during their state visits to Canada. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8320005" data-originallang="en"> The Minister of Natural Resources recently stated in a CTV interview, “We are not interested in investing in LNG facilities. That's the role of the private sector. They need to assess the business case and make the investments.” </p>
<p data-HoCid="8320006" data-originallang="en"> The private sector has assessed the business case for Canadian LNG positively and has repeatedly tried to invest in LNG in Canada, evidenced by the fact that there have been 18 proposals for LNG projects submitted to the federal government. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8320007" data-originallang="en"> Despite this, the Liberal government has consistently delayed and denied these LNG projects, and, as a result, the only LNG project currently under construction in Canada is one that was approved by the previous Conservative government. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8320008" data-originallang="en"> The committee: </p>
<p data-HoCid="8320009" data-originallang="en"> 1. Report its concern regarding this matter to the House of Commons; and </p>
<p data-HoCid="8320010" data-originallang="en"> 2. Invite the Minister of Natural Resources to testify before the committee regarding his comments for no less than two hours, on or before April 18, 2024. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8320011" data-originallang="en">I just want to give some context to make the case for why elected members of the natural resources committee should support this motion and invite the <a data-HoCid="299995" href="/politicians/jonathan-wilkinson/" title="Jonathan Wilkinson">minister</a> to appear.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8320012" data-originallang="en">First of all, of course, Conservatives agree in principle that what should happen is that a government should set attractive fiscal and regulatory investment conditions so that private sector proponents can bring home big projects, jobs and money to Canada while helping to expand and accelerate Canada's environmentally responsible oil and gas, other energy and other technologies—but in particular LNG—in the near term to European allies.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8320013" data-originallang="en">Conservatives agree that oil and gas projects, export projects, pipelines and energy infrastructure should not require taxpayer subsidies or taxpayer dollars. That, of course, has been happening in recent years, precisely because of the NDP-Liberal anti-energy red tape, gatekeeping, permitting timelines, uncertainty, and anti-energy messages and policies that have driven investment in major energy projects out of Canada, primarily into the United States, and therefore have driven a brain drain and have driven Canadian jobs, money and businesses into other jurisdictions as well.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8320014" data-originallang="en">It should be noted, of course, that the Greek prime minister was the first Greek leader to come to Canada in more than 40 years. It is a big deal that here, on this goodwill visit to discuss shared interests with the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister of Canada</a>, he said in Canada and in the media that his country would like to start importing Canadian LNG and that Canada would, as he said, “absolutely” be an ideal partner.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8320015" data-originallang="en"> Greece's prime minister made the point that Greece is a big entry point for LNG, obviously for the Greek market but also for Eastern Europe in general. He specifically commented on the fact that a supply of Canadian LNG could help support Ukraine in real ways by breaking dependence on Putin's oil and gas in the region as they fight his illegal aggression and attack on them. He told Canada and Canadians that Greece is putting the finishing touches on a major facility to start importing LNG and processing LNG tankers. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8320016" data-originallang="en">Of course, that great Prime Minister just follows in the footsteps of other Canadian allies and world leaders who have been asking for a supply of Canadian LNG, including the Japanese prime minister and the German chancellor.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8320017" data-originallang="en">Of course, mind-bogglingly, the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> of Canada said there was no business case for the development of Canadian LNG. First of all, he's apparently the only world leader and the only guy in the entire discussion who thinks there's no business case for Canadian LNG. Of course, what is actually happening is death by delay, which is because this anti-energy government has increased permitting timelines, increased taxes and pancaked and layered on anti-energy policies and laws that deter investment and then jeopardize even approved projects' being able to get built. What has actually happened is the reality of fiscal and regulatory conditions, which means that when we are trying to attract projects of that size with that investment, with that risk and with those job numbers, the regulatory and fiscal conditions passed by governments are inextricably linked and inherently embedded in the private sector's assessment of what is a good business case.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8320018" data-originallang="en">The problem in Canada's scenario is our domestic government's anti-energy policies, red tape and laws. The problem in Canada's scenario is the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> of Canada being the only person in the country, and apparently also among world leaders, saying there's no business case for Canadian LNG.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8320019" data-originallang="en">I think it's important to note, of course, that the request for Canadian LNG has been made by more world leaders. For example, in June 2022, Ukraine's ambassador issued a call for Canadian oil and gas companies to help in the fight against Putin's attack by entering and expanding into the European market with LNG. She said, at that time, “Canadian companies, we do think, should take the opportunity to enter and expand in the EU market”.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8320020" data-originallang="en"> I'm sure, Chair, since you are from the province of Alberta, a major natural gas area along with many others right across Canada, you would agree with the importance of expanding natural gas development and exporting LNG around the world to help break dependency on despots and dictators with much lower environmental track records and almost no human and labour rights or standards to speak of.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8320021" data-originallang="en">Also in 2022, Latvia's ambassador made it known that they would welcome shipments of Canadian LNG to help Europe reduce its dependence on Russian gas. He said, “We are trying to build a resilient energy system. If Canada is going to invest in LNG, we would wholeheartedly support it.” </p>
<p data-HoCid="8320022" data-originallang="en">Of course, the reality is that, after nine years, today, Canada still doesn't export any LNG, despite being the fifth-largest natural gas producer in the world, and it is precisely because of the NDP-Liberals' domestic anti-energy policies and red tape. This is bad for Canada, but good for all of Canada's global competitors, good for the United States, our biggest energy competitor and customer, and good for the top 10 major oil and gas competitive regimes in the world, almost none of which are democracies and almost all of which are dictators and despots.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8320023" data-originallang="en">The truth is, of course, that there have been 18 LNG proposals made in Canada, and in the last eight to nine years of these NDP-Liberals, zero of them have been built. Only three have been approved, and only one is actually currently under construction. That, of course, was approved by the previous Conservative government but then delayed by the Liberals after they formed government, after which they did give another green light, but that, of course, was a delay in itself.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8320024" data-originallang="en">The reality is that, because of <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister Trudeau's</a> anti-energy messages about Canadian LNG and because of the suite of anti-energy policies and laws passed by this government in the last nine years, the NDP-Liberals have almost left Canada completely behind. We have almost entirely missed the opportunity with our moral, political, security, sovereignty, and energy and food poverty reasons. Regardless, we have almost entirely missed the opportunity for Canada to participate in what is obviously a global role that is demanded by world leaders, including, very significantly, our allies around the world in various conflicts combatting regimes hostile to Canada and to the free world. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8320025" data-originallang="en"> Warren Buffett cancelled the 50% of funding that he was prepared to invest in the Saguenay LNG plant, because of instability in the current Canadian political context. He, of course, diplomatically meant the various anti-energy policies and laws passed by this government.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8320026" data-originallang="en">What's important is that the NDP-Liberals try to pretend they're external observers and have nothing to do with this. They like to blame global trends and things happening around the world to rationalize our unique Canadian situation actually caused by their own policies and legislation. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8320027" data-originallang="en">To make that point, and to make sure Canadians don't.... It's not just me saying it. Here's the contrast of what has happened with the United States in almost the exact same time frame where 18 LNG proposals were made to this government, but most have been mothballed or withdrawn by their private sector proponents because of these anti-energy NDP-Liberals. In that same time frame, seven LNG terminals have been constructed—not just approved but constructed—in the U.S. Twenty more have been approved, and five more will be opened by 2028. In that same time frame, the United States has become the world's leading LNG exporter. Its exports are expected to double by 2030. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8320028" data-originallang="en">What is wild about this is that in January, the Biden administration announced that it would put a pause on the permit approvals for LNG projects. The reality is, of course, that this is after it has already moved forward to ensure that the U.S. dominates the global market, while our own <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>, against the best interests of Canada and Canadians, has let Canada fall behind. I think it is incomprehensible that instead of taking the opportunity for Canada to lead in North America, the <a data-HoCid="299995" href="/politicians/jonathan-wilkinson/" title="Jonathan Wilkinson">natural resources minister</a> praised the pause and said it would create an opportunity for Canada—except that, of course, the numbers show it's his own government that has driven LNG exports, projects, jobs, and money away from Canada and almost lost that opportunity for all of us.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8320029" data-originallang="en">It behooves Canadians to ask, what are the consequences of all this? What does this actually mean? Well, this is what it means. It means that in the midst of a global energy and food poverty crisis, and in the midst of a skyrocketing cost of living crisis in Canada, driven by inflationary deficit spending by the NDP-Liberals, interest rates have increased, making life more and more unaffordable for Canadians. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8320030" data-originallang="en">Despite the fact that European allies are begging Canada to help supply the energy needs for their citizens, for their countries, and to reduce dependence on despots and dictators, it is just mind-boggling that the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> continues to say there isn't a business case for Canadian LNG. The <a data-HoCid="299995" href="/politicians/jonathan-wilkinson/" title="Jonathan Wilkinson">natural resources minister</a> has not bothered to take that opportunity, that window for Canada, which is almost completely lost. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8320031" data-originallang="en">It is also mind-boggling given the debate in Canada around support for Ukraine against Putin's illegal attack. There are many great words coming from the Liberals, and they have taken measures to support Ukraine, but it is blindingly and wildly obvious to me that the biggest way to help support Ukraine, in addition to sending weapons, is to send Canadian LNG and energy, and other technologies so it can break its dependence on Putin and Putin's energy control of the entire region. Instead, this government signed off on permits to actually send turbines to help Putin's own gas pipeline and fund his war. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8320032" data-originallang="en"> Let's talk about what else has happened since then. France has signed a 27-year agreement with Qatar for LNG. Germany has signed a 15-year deal with Qatar for LNG. The Netherlands has signed a 27-year deal with Qatar for LNG. China has signed a 27-year deal with Qatar for LNG. India signed a 20-year deal with Qatar for LNG just last month. You'll know that a week ago, the Indian prime minister was talking about how they're ramping up coal and the benefit it will provide to many of their citizens, who are also suffering from food and energy poverty, who live in places that are not as industrialized and who don't yet have the same standard of living and quality of life that many Canadians and people living in North America get to enjoy. Japan is also currently in talks with Qatar to secure LNG imports, after our <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> turned it away. I think Canadians should know that in the midst of all this, the leader of Hamas, the terrorist organization wreaking havoc in Gaza and on Israel, lives in Qatar.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8320033" data-originallang="en">These are the real geopolitical, security and sovereignty consequences of the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a>'s, his minister's and the NDP-Liberals' anti-energy costly coalition. It's clear that the world wants and needs more Canadian LNG, but what has happened after nine years of this anti-energy government is that our allies are forced to sign deals with despots and countries that are home to terrorist organization leaders. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8320034" data-originallang="en">The result is that our biggest energy competitor, customer and North American ally is outpacing Canada. Mexico announced a couple of months ago that it is also going to have a goal to ramp up its LNG development and export, so we may also.... This anti-energy NDP-Liberal government and anti-energy <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> are apparently going to be just fine with Mexico also outpacing Canada on the continent for LNG development and exports.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8320035" data-originallang="en">It's absolutely mind-boggling, but clear from a common-sense Conservative perspective, that the reality of <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister Trudeau</a>'s anti-energy policies and messages is that they actually enrich regimes that sponsor terrorism and are attacking allies—including the people of Ukraine, whom these NDP-Liberals like to talk about supporting.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8320036" data-originallang="en">To make it clear, common-sense Conservatives would expand and accelerate traditional oil and gas development in Canada. We would expand and accelerate LNG approvals and exports from Canada. We would ensure that private sector proponents have clarity, certainty, predictability, fairness and the backing of the government to build their projects, once approved—after they've gone through Canada's expert and unparalleled regulatory assessment regime.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8320037" data-originallang="en">For these reasons, I hope the elected members from all parts of this country on the natural resources committee will support this motion to discuss this issue in further depth and invite the <a data-HoCid="299995" href="/politicians/jonathan-wilkinson/" title="Jonathan Wilkinson">Minister of Natural Resources</a> to be present at the committee to join this discussion.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8320038" data-originallang="en">Thanks, Chair.</p>
