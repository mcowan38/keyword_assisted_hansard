<p data-HoCid="7670714" data-originallang="en">The innovation agency has taken a number of features from international best practices that it's put into the blueprint that it's released to date. One of these is the agility to move at the speed of business by moving more quickly and advancing projects more aggressively with promising corporations and potential start-ups. The other is private sector expertise, by ensuring it actually has savvy and capacities that are steeped in the world of business, and also that it's complementary to the other existing processes and programs that are in place.</p>
