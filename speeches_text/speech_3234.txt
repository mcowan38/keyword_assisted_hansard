<p data-HoCid="8124790" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8124791" data-originallang="fr">I'd like to thank the witnesses. I realize you're not in an easy position. Your presence here today and your presence on the ground in the countries involved are both challenging. I am so very grateful for everything you do.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8124792" data-originallang="fr">Like many of my colleagues, I was a little surprised by what happened on November 9 at the UN General Assembly when Canada voted against a resolution condemning the illegality of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Golan Heights and demanding that Israel respect the Geneva Convention, among other things. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8124793" data-originallang="fr">Along with Israel, the United States, Hungary and four Pacific micro-states, Canada was one of the few countries that voted against the resolution. The move seemed to contradict Canada's traditional position. In 2020, Canada indicated that it doesn't recognize permanent Israeli control over the occupied territories, including the West Bank. Canada even agreed with the UN Security Council that settlements are a serious obstacle to achieving a just, lasting and comprehensive peace.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8124794" data-originallang="fr">Why did Canada vote as it did?</p>
