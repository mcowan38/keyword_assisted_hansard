<p data-HoCid="8301026" data-originallang="en">I just want to say that I also am extremely concerned about the rise of anti-Semitism in the country. We just had the <a data-HoCid="299996" href="/politicians/arif-virani/" title="Arif Virani">justice minister</a> here telling us that we already have hate laws, hate speech laws, but people are calling “death to Jews” across the country and not a single charge has been filed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8301027" data-originallang="en"> I'm quite alarmed, when I see the protests, the violence and the targeting of Jewish businesses, that the reaction from the police is not the same as it is in.... We've just seen a fishers' protest going on. The police are there making sure that the protest remains peaceful and are bringing in their horses, but here in Ottawa when we're having pro-Palestinian demonstrations and they're calling out things that are anti-Semitic and kicking in cars and breaking off mirrors, the police are standing by and doing nothing. What is the point of having federal law if you don't have the enforcement of law? </p>
<p data-HoCid="8301028" data-originallang="en">I think that this has come to a crisis point, and I'm very supportive of doing a study to figure out what exactly we can do to use the existing laws and enforce them, and what else we can add to that, because Jews don't feel safe in this country. I'm alarmed at the demise of what was Canada: a free nation where people could feel safe and worship. I think people don't feel safe, and we need to address it.</p>
