<p data-HoCid="7464948" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill <a data-HoCid="11893577" href="/bills/44-1/C-29/" title="An Act to provide for the establishment of a national council for reconciliation">C-29</a>, an act to provide for the establishment of a national council for truth and reconciliation. I want to begin by acknowledging that we are gathered on the traditional unceded lands of the Algonquin peoples.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7464949" data-originallang="en">At the outset, I want to acknowledge the incredible work of many of my colleagues from different parties, including the member for <a data-HoCid="278152" href="/politicians/jaime-battiste/" title="Jaime Battiste">Sydney—Victoria</a>, who is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations, the member for <a data-HoCid="278721" href="/politicians/michael-mcleod/" title="Michael McLeod">Northwest Territories</a>, the member for <a data-HoCid="278704" href="/politicians/lori-idlout/" title="Lori Idlout">Nunavut</a>, the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>, the member for <a data-HoCid="278619" href="/politicians/blake-desjarlais/" title="Blake Desjarlais">Edmonton Griesbach</a> and others, who, over the many years we have been here, have been inspirational in their work and advocacy as we make sure that as a government, we move forward on reconciliation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7464950" data-originallang="en">Reconciliation is multi-layered, is often complex and is an issue that will take generations to achieve in Canada. Canada has gone through 154 years of colonialism and deeply rooted legislation that often disempowered and displaced first nations, Inuit and Métis across Canada. We have gone from having over 90 indigenous languages to only a handful being spoken today. We have seen the horrific results of residential schools and the intergenerational trauma they have created, and the lasting effects of the hurt and loss. We saw this with the unmarked graves, starting last year, and I suspect we will see it again and again as we unpack this deeply hurtful issue over the next few years. Parliament recently acknowledged what happened with residential schools as genocide, and that, too, is a very important aspect of moving forward and speaking truth to power.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7464951" data-originallang="en">As we look at establishing the national council for reconciliation, it is important to look at history. In 2015, when we took office, the commissioners of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission presented their findings, with 94 calls to action. That was in December 2015. They outlined the bare minimum that needs to be done in order for our path to reconciliation to move forward. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7464952" data-originallang="en">Since then, we have seen a number of different initiatives, including the report of the MMIWG, the missing and murdered women and girls report, and the calls to justice, as well as several other very important findings, including the unmarked graves. These things put additional responsibilities on the government and on all Canadians to address.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7464953" data-originallang="en">The 94 calls to action are an all-encompassing set of guidelines for the federal government, provincial governments and in some cases municipal governments, as well as organizations, particularly national indigenous organizations, and all Canadians. It is important to recognize that reconciliation is not a journey that can just be undertaken by Canada as a government. It needs to be an all-of-Canada effort that includes all stakeholders.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7464954" data-originallang="en">When we talk about reconciliation, oftentimes we talk about what Canada is prepared to do, but it really comes down to how much trust and confidence indigenous people can have in this process. What we have seen in the last seven years is that while we have moved ahead on a number of very important initiatives, we have often seen this relationship be two steps forward and one step back because there is a lot of unpacking to do. As we approach and encounter these issues, it is important that as a government we double down and recommit to working harder to ensure we move forward on this process.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7464955" data-originallang="en">It is an imperfect process. It is an imperfect set of ideas that often may need reflection, and in that I am pleased to share with the House some of my experiences over the past seven years working across party lines with the members opposite. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7464956" data-originallang="en">I do want to start off with our work on Bill <a data-HoCid="8160636" href="/bills/42-1/C-262/" title="An Act to ensure that the laws of Canada are in harmony with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">C-262</a>, which was a private member's bill brought forward by my friend Romeo Saganash. It essentially called for the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and I was fortunate to work with Mr. Saganash over the couple of years he was actively advocating for Bill <a data-HoCid="8160636" href="/bills/42-1/C-262/" title="An Act to ensure that the laws of Canada are in harmony with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">C-262</a>. We travelled a fair bit in our committee work and spoke to many individuals: young people, elders, band councils and indigenous organization members. The enormous support the bill had across Canada with indigenous people was remarkable. However, we saw that the same level of commitment was not here in Parliament. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7464957" data-originallang="en">Over time, sadly, Bill C-262 did not pass, but we were able to get Bill <a data-HoCid="11007812" href="/bills/43-2/C-15/" title="An Act respecting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples">C-15</a> through Parliament in 2021, and basically it is calls to action 43 and 44, and it was able to pass. The second part of UNDRIP is the implementation of a national action plan, and our department is working very hard with indigenous partners and national indigenous organizations, as well as rights holders and many others, to make sure we have an action plan that can really address a review of laws and move us forward on this path.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7464958" data-originallang="en">One of the things that has really humbled me is the work we have done on indigenous languages. There is an act, Bill <a data-HoCid="10293463" href="/bills/42-1/C-91/" title="An Act respecting Indigenous languages">C-91</a>, which was passed in 2019, and it was a critical moment in Canada because, when we talk about language, it is so fundamental to all of us. Often, I look at the passion with which my colleagues from the Bloc Québécois address the issue of bilingualism and language, and the passion with which many of my colleagues on this side speak to the need to protect the French language.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7464959" data-originallang="en">I think it is so critical to ensure that linguistic minorities are protected across Canada, but often missing in that conversation is the need to protect and save the many indigenous languages that existed prior to Confederation. In many ways, those languages are in their last stages. Medically speaking, they are on life support because we have so many languages that are at a point of being lost permanently. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7464960" data-originallang="en">I know the member for <a data-HoCid="278265" href="/politicians/karen-vecchio/" title="Karen Vecchio">Elgin—Middlesex—London</a> spoke about Oneida Nation on the Thames, and that is one of the groups we met during the development of Bill <a data-HoCid="10293463" href="/bills/42-1/C-91/" title="An Act respecting Indigenous languages">C-91</a>. It was devastating to see that only a handful of people were able to speak that language, which shows how important it is that Bill C-91 is there. As well, we, along with the support of the New Democratic Party, repealed mandatory minimum penalties just last week, and we implemented the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7464961" data-originallang="en">These are some measures that speak to the work that has been done, but there is a lot more to do, and I believe the national council would be a very important tool for us to measure objectively what work we need to do. It would measure and report back to the House, as well as to Canadians, on the need to fill in the gaps and to make sure we fulfill all the commitments in the calls to action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7464962" data-originallang="en">I look forward to questions and comments from my friends, and I thank them for this opportunity to speak.</p>
