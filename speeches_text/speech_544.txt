<p data-HoCid="6476166" data-originallang="en">Mr. Wall, it's going to be impossible for all members to be able to pose questions if you don't respect the chair and the timeline. I would ask you, please, to pay attention when I attempt to interrupt so that we can try to maintain some sort of order here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6476167" data-originallang="en">Ms. Gazan, please go ahead, for six minutes.</p>
