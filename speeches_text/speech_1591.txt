<p data-HoCid="7089800" data-originallang="en"> In Crimea we observe three main trends.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7089801" data-originallang="en">Russia, for all these years, has been rapidly transforming the former resort into a powerful base. They formed a joint military union in the central Black Sea and concentrated on ballistic missile attacks. Such actions are a danger for not only Ukraine but others, because they can achieve their targets in the Baltic states, Poland, the Czech Republic, Israel, Syria, etc. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7089802" data-originallang="en">The second trend is that the entire permanent population of Crimea is considered by Russia to be potentially disloyal. Therefore, after the occupation, Russia enforced a policy of expulsion of the most active part of the population from Crimea and replaced them with citizens of the Russian Federation from different regions through controlled migration. As a result—and I don't know the current number—the population growth rate of Sevastopol three years ago was an unprecedented 14%, so we are dealing with forced displacement and colonization, which in itself is a war crime.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7089803" data-originallang="en">The last trend we observed over all these years is that after the Russian occupation, the peninsula became a proving ground for testing new tactics of information warfare, suppression of dissent and formation of military moves. Essentially, Russia has conducted a unique experiment for today of integrating annexed territory, and they have components, such as the forced imposition of citizenship in the Russian Federation and a total attack on the rights and freedom of the population, to keep them in subjection.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7089804" data-originallang="en">The final thing I want to emphasize is the deliberate discrimination and persecution of the Crimean Tatar people, the indigenous people of Crimea. In our list of political prisoners, the majority of them are Crimean Tatars. My friend and colleague Server Mustafayev, who is the head of Crimean Solidarity, was imprisoned for a huge term in a colony, after fabricated criminal cases, only because he had the courage to provide human rights work in the peninsula where people were left alone with only Russian occupiers.</p>
