<p data-HoCid="6666912" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6666913" data-originallang="en">There are a couple of suggestions that I want to pass on on behalf of my colleague <a data-HoCid="253019" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Leah Gazan</a>. One is to ensure the inclusion of perspectives on the guaranteed, livable basic income and how it could work in partnership with EI. The other is to ensure the inclusion of perspectives on the expansion of EI sickness benefits. Obviously, we know that was something that was somewhat addressed in the budget, but many, as we even heard today, are calling for Canada to go further.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6666914" data-originallang="en">Some key points that were also raised today were the particular perspectives of precarious workers. That could even be in the context of this crisis, where we saw precarious workers in long-term care and in other heavily impacted workplaces...and what it means to expand EI to make sure that it's available to them. Then there are the migrant workers, as well, who, as we heard again today, pay into EI but aren't able to access it.</p>
