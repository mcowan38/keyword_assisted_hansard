<p data-HoCid="7602182" data-originallang="en">Concerns have been raised. I think the minister received correspondence in this regard as well. One of the concerns that was raised was by Kenneth Stern, who wrote in The Guardian that “as the American Jewish Committee's antisemitism expert, I was the lead drafter of what was then called the 'working definition of antisemitism'”. He suggests that there are concerns with that definition because it is less clear. One of the concerns that has been raised is that white supremacists, the most vicious anti-Semites of all—and I reference the flying of the Nazi flag—can find loopholes through that definition that are not available for them to use through the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism.</p>
