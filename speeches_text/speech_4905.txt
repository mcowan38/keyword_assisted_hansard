<p data-HoCid="8576672" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for <a data-HoCid="278131" href="/politicians/lena-metlege-diab/" title="Lena Metlege Diab">Halifax West</a>.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576673" data-originallang="en">Just over 11 months ago, we had an emergency debate on Gaza, and now here we are again in another emergency debate as this conflict continues to escalate, from Gaza to the West Bank and now to Syria and Lebanon. I said it then and I say it again now: There must be a ceasefire. The violence must end.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576674" data-originallang="en">This is a very dangerous moment in world history that threatens to pull in more countries and put more innocent civilians at risk. I am very worried about this continuing pattern of escalation. From the start, my heart and my worry has been with the innocent civilians. The innocent civilians in Gaza, in the West Bank, in Lebanon and in Israel want no part of this war. They just want to be able to live their lives, to make a living and to raise their children without the fear of bombing, rockets, missiles or ground invasions. This should be the right of every person, no matter where they live or call home.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576675" data-originallang="en">I visited the West Bank in January, and I met small children who go to bed every night fearful of sniper bullets. I saw the bullet holes near their bedroom windows. No one should have to grow up like this.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576676" data-originallang="en">Scarborough Centre is home to a vibrant Lebanese population, and I have been on the phone and at in-person meetings with them nearly constantly over the past week. They are beside themselves with worry for their loved ones back in Lebanon. Communication with them has been spotty and unreliable. As these members of my community watch the news of days of Israeli bombing that has killed hundreds, they hold their breath, waiting for a message from their loved ones to know if they are alive or not.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576677" data-originallang="en">No one should be forced to live with this fear. No people, in any country, deserve this. Community members told me of one family in Lebanon who drove from the south to Beirut with their baby and small children, looking for safety. Israeli bombs hit the road ahead of and behind them. They say the children will forever be scared by this experience. They tell me schools are being used as shelters, with people gathering mattresses, food and water.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576678" data-originallang="en">With the news of today's missile attack by Iran, the pattern of escalation continues and the danger for the innocent people of the region increases. I condemn all attacks that target innocent civilians.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576679" data-originallang="en">This conflict did not begin 11 months ago. These are not the first bombings of Gaza or Lebanon. These are not the first rocket or missile attacks against Israel. The roots of this conflict are deep, and they must be addressed substantively.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576680" data-originallang="en">However, what must be abundantly clear is that Israel's actions are not making anyone safer: not the people of Palestine, not the people of Lebanon and not the people of Israel. Instead, this widening conflict is only making everyone more unsafe. The pattern must end.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576681" data-originallang="en">In December, Canada called for a ceasefire in Gaza. Last week, Canada joined the United States, the European Union and nine other allied countries in calling for a ceasefire in Lebanon. Unfortunately, last week's call for a ceasefire has been ignored, as was the one in December. Repeating the same thing that has failed again and again, and expecting different results, is a strategy proven to fail. It is time to move beyond statements; it is time for action.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576682" data-originallang="en">Canada must implement a clear and unambiguous two-way arms embargo. No Canadian-manufactured weapons should be used to kill any innocent civilians, and there must be no loopholes, such as shipping weapons via the United States.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576683" data-originallang="en">I welcome the recent comments by the global affairs <a data-HoCid="278918" href="/politicians/melanie-joly/" title="Mélanie Joly">minister</a> regarding an arms embargo, but I am asking the government for a clear statement that brokers no confusion: a clear and unambiguous two-way arms embargo with no qualifications, exceptions or asterisks for existing contracts.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576684" data-originallang="en">We must go further still. Calling for a ceasefire and an arms embargo is the least Canadians expect. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8576685" data-originallang="en">Let us look at the on-the-record, public comments of Netanyahu and his cabinet, who have a habit of saying out loud what would ordinarily be kept quiet. On Israeli TV, education minister Yoav Kisch said Lebanon and Hezbollah are indistinguishable, “Lebanon will be annihilated” and the people of Lebanon will pay the price. That was the latest in a pattern of disgusting and dangerous comments by ministers in the Netanyahu cabinet. Deputy Speaker Nissim Vaturi made a call to “wipe Gaza off the face of the earth” and added that “Gaza must be burned.” He went on to say, “There are no innocents there [in Gaza]”, and, referring to the Palestinian people, he said, “I have no mercy for those who are still there. We need to eliminate them”. These are just a few of many examples. These are not the words of a government that Canada can call a friend or ally.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576686" data-originallang="en">Canada cannot accept pro-genocide comments by any government. Officials advocating for genocide must be banned from entering Canada and there must be sanctions against a Netanyahu government that refuses to even consider peace.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576687" data-originallang="en">Last week at the United Nations, Jordanian foreign minister Ayman Safadi said Arab and Muslim countries would guarantee Israel's security if Israel agreed to the establishment of a Palestinian state. The proposal was dismissed outright by Netanyahu. He has shown no willingness to achieve a just peace that will bring safety and security for Palestinians, Israelis and Lebanese.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576688" data-originallang="en">It is past time for Canada to recognize the Palestinian state. It does not need to be studied at committee. The government can stand up today, in this House or outside it, and declare that Canada recognizes the Palestinian state. This would show that Canada believes in the right of self-determination for all people, and it would send a clear message to Netanyahu's ministers who want to “wipe Gaza off the face of the earth”: Canada will not stay silent in the face of genocide.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576689" data-originallang="en">I also worry deeply about the impact this conflict is having on people here in Canada. It is tearing communities apart. I see the rising incidents of anti-Palestinian racism, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism and I worry about the walls being built between Canadians. This cannot continue. It is very important that we make sure this conflict does not further increase anti-Palestinian racism, anti-Semitism or Islamophobia here in Canada. This summer, I heard from Canadians, from Scarborough to Vancouver, on anti-Palestinian racism, and I heard very clearly that this needs to end.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8576690" data-originallang="en">I want peace for the people of Lebanon, Palestine and Israel. I urge Canada to use all of its diplomatic tools, including sanctions, to exert pressure for an end to this conflict. Too many innocent civilians have already paid with their lives. If this is allowed to continue, many more will die as well. It needs to end. We need to make sure innocent civilian lives are protected. We have seen enough.</p>
