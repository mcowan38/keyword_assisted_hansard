<p data-HoCid="6791931" data-originallang="en">We are learning about the issue related to the UNRWA director in Gaza. We're looking into that. To me, it indicates the extreme tension that takes place in Gaza. You have an organization trying to represent the UN and support the people, and their values and interests are often extremely different from those of Hamas, a listed terrorist organization, and other groups in Gaza. The tension is always there. This is certainly another indication of that taking place.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6791932" data-originallang="en">On the issue of the educational materials, as mentioned, we have had a series of meetings and discussions. A number of measures have put in place, including the launch of a digital learning platform. That has a vetting procedure of three steps. Educational materials, before they're posted online, are evaluated in terms of neutrality and appropriateness. That is in place now. Those neutrality discussions, which Canada funds through its programming, are ongoing. We're having meetings every couple of weeks.</p>
