<p data-HoCid="7653462" data-originallang="en">We went through a very extensive review process, and there was a fairly high level of comfort from the review panel in terms of what's being done to accommodate both salmon and resident killer whales. In terms of biofilm, there was one question about which they felt they did not have enough information to reach a conclusion. That was not about the quantity of the biofilm, but the quality of the biofilm.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7653463" data-originallang="en"> Certainly, we've had numerous experts in the field who agree with us about the lack of impact, and the first nations in the area agree with us. It's interesting that there's great interest in first nations and indigenous knowledge when they agree with the department, but when they disagree, they suddenly don't want to talk to them.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7653464" data-originallang="en">When they said that the impact would be immediate, we made the offer that we would build, in effect, the shell of the facility, and then we would stop; we would take a break—which we have to in any event, because of fishing seasons and crabbing—and there could be a monitoring process. If there were signs of impact that couldn't be mitigated in other ways, we would pull it out. That's how confident we are. All of a sudden, the department came back to us and said, “Well, maybe not immediate; we really need a few years.”</p>
<p data-HoCid="7653465" data-originallang="en"> That's the frustration we've been dealing with.</p>
