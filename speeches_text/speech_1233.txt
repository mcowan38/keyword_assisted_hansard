<p data-HoCid="6834087" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6834088" data-originallang="en">Two minutes is too short for this, but thank you to all three witnesses. Mr. Fogel from the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, and Mr. Farooq and Ms. Omer from the National Council of Canadian Muslims, thanks for being with us and helping us through this very difficult conversation. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6834089" data-originallang="en">I'm going to ask a question that a couple of people attempted to ask and ran out of time, which is about balancing civil liberties and keeping Canadians safe, particularly when it comes to the Internet. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6834090" data-originallang="en">Mr. Fogel, I think it was you who said that we need new tools when it comes to regulating the Internet. I don't know if you were talking about criminal laws or civil remedies. Perhaps you could expand on that. What would civil remedies look like as far as that goes?</p>
