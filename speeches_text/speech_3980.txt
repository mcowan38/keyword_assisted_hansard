<p data-HoCid="8352003" data-originallang="en">Absolutely. Thank you for that. I was nearly done, but I had a couple of summary points. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8352004" data-originallang="en">The MMIWG inquiry called for justice reform to make systemic changes to ensure the justice system is culturally appropriate. The creation of a nationwide red dress alert program is a tangible step for the federal government to take to end the ongoing genocide of missing and murdered indigenous women, girls and 2-spirit people.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8352005" data-originallang="en">As MP Gazan has said, response times to reports of missing indigenous women, girls and 2-spirit people are far too slow. A red dress alert, similar to the Amber alert, would make a difference.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8352006" data-originallang="en"> What we, as indigenous people, are asking for is fairly simple. It is the same care, attention and respect afforded to the rest of the population. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8352007" data-originallang="en">We believe that we can find solutions and lead the way. I think that's one thing that is often missing. We saw it even in the inquiry, where it wasn't indigenous-led, even though we had indigenous professionals, experts and community members in the room. The oversight by the government was too much to allow it to move ahead the way it needed to.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8352008" data-originallang="en">Thank you. </p>
