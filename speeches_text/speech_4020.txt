<p data-HoCid="8391246" data-originallang="en">Just for the record, the motion asks to condemn anti-Semitism. I've noticed that the member across the way refuses to use that word. He's accusing me of wanting to condemn people. That's not true at all. That's not what this motion says. It says that it condemns anti-Semitism.</p>
