That is hugely problematic. As you mentioned, there are the Security Council seats that we've lost. There are many emerging economies that.... The global south is looking at the decisions that Canada makes, and it doesn't see us as a legitimate, ethical actor anymore. We are losing that reputational benefit that Canada, as a country, has had.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8139351" data-originallang="en">You spoke a lot about what's happening, the horrific atrocities that we're seeing in Gaza right now. I want you to speak a bit about the issue of recognition of the state of Palestine. Should we, as a committee, be pushing the Canadian government to recognize the state of Palestine? Would that help in moving the political and justice processes forward?</p>
