<p data-HoCid="8705557" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, UNRWA is exactly the way that it has been described. It's providing basic, life-saving aid to those who need it the most. We support providing international humanitarian assistance to everybody who needs it, and, in particular, today, to Palestinian civilians in Gaza, especially Palestinian children who are not only caught in the violence that's ongoing, but who are suffering a polio epidemic and are dying from things like malnutrition. UNRWA is helping there.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8705558" data-originallang="en"> We support Canada to get aid to those children using the most effective means available as quickly as possible to save their lives. We don't think that children should suffer punishment because of the political conflict going on around them. That's why we support Canada to increase aid to those who need it mostâ€”not just Muslims, but Muslims, non-Muslims and all people who have the greatest need for this. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8705559" data-originallang="en">That's the kind of life-saving aid that UNRWA is providing. That's why we support Canada continuing to support it. </p>
