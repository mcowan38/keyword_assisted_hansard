<p data-HoCid="8479620" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Babili, I'm so terribly sorry about the indifference you encountered with your elected official and with the University of Victoria. It truly is unacceptable that you went through such a terrible and harrowing experience and that they did not address it appropriately.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8479621" data-originallang="en"> Here is my question now for the panellists, and I will start with Mr. Babili. Unfortunately, we've seen a steep rise in anti-Semitism over the course of the past seven months. Is it your assessment that the rise in Islamophobia has increased considerably in the last seven months as well?</p>
