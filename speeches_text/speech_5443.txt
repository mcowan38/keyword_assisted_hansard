<p data-HoCid="8714692" data-originallang="en"> Chair, that is a very interesting question, and it illustrates what I mentioned in my statement.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714693" data-originallang="en">There are different ways of doing that. There isn't an instruction booklet that indicates how a state can declare its recognition of a new state. What's sought by international law is clarity and absence of ambiguity on the matter.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714694" data-originallang="en">For those countries, as far as I could see, they made very official public and outward statements to the international community to indicate that they were taking that step. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8714695" data-originallang="en">In terms of their internal communication, I would not be familiar with what they did. By “internal”, I mean how the recognizing state and the State of Palestine transacted between themselves. Normally there's an exchange of diplomatic communication, diplomatic notes, an exchange of communications between foreign ministers or heads of government and heads of state. Again, that's how it's done. It's normally an agreed arrangement between the two entities, but I am not privy to the detail of how it was done, precisely, by Norway, Spain, Ireland or Slovenia.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714696" data-originallang="en">I would anticipate that's how they did it, Chair.</p>
