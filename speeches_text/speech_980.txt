<p data-HoCid="6702625" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, we are following the situation with grave concern. We call on all parties to end the violence, de-escalate tensions, protect civilians and uphold international law.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6702626" data-originallang="en"> Rocket attacks against Israel are completely unacceptable, and Canada supports Israel's right to ensure its own security. Violence at Al-Aqsa is also unacceptable. Places of worship are for people to gather peacefully and should never be sites of violence. We are also gravely concerned by continued expansion of settlements and evictions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6702627" data-originallang="en">Canada supports the two-state solution, and we urge all parties to renew their commitment to peace and security.</p>
