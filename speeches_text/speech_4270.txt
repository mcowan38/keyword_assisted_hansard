<p data-HoCid="8435133" data-originallang="en">This isn't new. Its deep roots are evident in the speed, intensity and acceleration of anti-Semitic hate. Canadian campuses began convulsing with anti-Semitic activity while Hamas terrorists were still in Israel slaughtering innocent civilians, long before Israel launched its military response. Many on campuses say they're not anti-Semitic but merely anti-Zionist. You will even hear that a small minority of Jewish students and faculty share this view. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8435134" data-originallang="en">Do not be fooled. Political criticism of Israel is absolutely acceptable and appropriate. Spend time in Israel and you will hear similar criticisms. A willingness to engage in criticism is core to Jewish values. However, this is not what we're seeing. Rather, calls for the violent erasure of the only Jewish state in the world and of the long history of Jewish people in this place and claims that Israel is uniquely evil or categorically unfit to determine its own destiny are racist. We see that overt racism in the campus examples we cited earlier, and in many others. </p>
