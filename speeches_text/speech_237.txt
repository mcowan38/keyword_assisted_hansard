<p data-HoCid="6216072" data-originallang="en">Thank you. Thanks, Ms. Gazan.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6216073" data-originallang="en">You will recall that we were very late getting started because of a number of technical issues. I said that I would ask the committee, because we need unanimous consent to continue after the hour.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6216074" data-originallang="en">Is it the wish of the committee to continue to fill out our round of questioning? Are there any comments? Does anyone have issues that would not enable them to?</p>
