<p data-HoCid="8016421" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, for the last 32 days, I, along with colleagues for<a data-HoCid="278775" href="/politicians/tim-louis/" title="Tim Louis"> Kitchener—Conestoga</a>, <a data-HoCid="278723" href="/politicians/valerie-bradford/" title="Valerie Bradford">Kitchener South—Hespeler</a> and <a data-HoCid="278642" href="/politicians/bryan-may/" title="Bryan May">Cambridge</a>, have been listening to and consoling residents in the Waterloo region for the deaths of thousands of innocent Israelis and Palestinians. We feel their pain and grief, and we bring their calls to action to this chamber.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8016422" data-originallang="en">There are parents having to explain to their kids why they are seeing death and horror in their social media feeds. We have children who are afraid to wear religious symbols, neighbours grieving the loss of loved ones, faith leaders fearing for the safety of congregations and people feeling silenced and kept from publicizing their views.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8016423" data-originallang="en">We hear the range of calls from Canadians for a humanitarian ceasefire, the release of civilian hostages, the safe return of all Canadians and a dedicated humanitarian corridor. We must continue working hard to achieve a just and lasting peace for all Palestinians and Israelis for the sake of humanity.</p>
