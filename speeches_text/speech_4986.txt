<p data-HoCid="8597905" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the evidence is clear. Samidoun, also known as the Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network, is knowingly acting on behalf of, at the direction of or in association with at least one terrorist entity listed under the Criminal Code: the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8597906" data-originallang="en">Samidoun is based in Canada and incorporated as a not-for-profit under the Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act. Other jurisdictions have taken action. Germany and Israel have listed Samidoun as a terrorist entity, and the European Union has banned this group from entry. The Liberal government needs to take terrorism and anti-Semitism seriously; it needs to take the evidence seriously and list Samidoun as a terrorist entity under the Criminal Code of Canada.</p>
