<p data-HoCid="8712731" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, reconciliation is an issue because Canada attempted to perpetrate a genocide, and the first step of the genocide was to target the children. The second step was to bring in hunger and forced famine to force people off the land.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8712732" data-originallang="en">I think my colleague would agree that, many days, the House of Commons is like <em>The Jerry Springer Show</em>. However, we are not hearing any talk about the genocide in Gaza or of the fact that, two days ago, Human Rights Watch found that Israel is guilty of crimes against humanity for using famine and targeting children. About 70% of the deaths in Gaza are women and children. That is a targeting of a people to destroy them. We have seen nothing from the <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> on the international stage.</p>
