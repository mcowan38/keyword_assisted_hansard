<p data-HoCid="8455541" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Madam Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8455542" data-originallang="en">I want to start by thanking all of the witnesses for being with us on this study. I do believe it's one of the most important things on which we've embarked. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8455543" data-originallang="en">In particular, I want to thank Mr. Sandler for being very forthright in placing the situation Canadian Jews face before this committee in a forceful manner.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455544" data-originallang="en">One of the things you didn't get to was the discussion about the 10 reasons why anti-Semitism is so pervasive. It's important we understand where it's coming from if we're going to make recommendations on how to combat it. I'd like to give you as much of my time as you need to talk about that.</p>
