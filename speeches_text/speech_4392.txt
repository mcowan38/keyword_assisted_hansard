<p data-HoCid="8455545" data-originallang="en"> Thank you. I appreciate that very much.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455546" data-originallang="en">I've identified the following factors, and I'm happy to elaborate on them as might be necessary. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8455547" data-originallang="en">We see the active involvement of extremists and extremist organizations in Canada, which are operating with impunity here. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8455548" data-originallang="en">We see foreign money infused into Canada. We've seen one expert describe Canada as a major hub for extremist financing and money laundering worldwide.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455549" data-originallang="en">We see the misuse of social media by circulating misinformation, anti-Semitic tropes and historical distortions. This misuse is orchestrated in many instances by extremists and foreign governments.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455550" data-originallang="en">We see radicalized faculty members who seek to indoctrinate students rather than engage in a discussion where controversial topics are discussed.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455551" data-originallang="en">We see in many classrooms a culture that does not promote respectful dialogue on controversial issues, and that does not encourage critical thinking and active listening.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455552" data-originallang="en">We see the confusion and often deliberate obfuscation of the distinction between protected speech and hate speech designed to immunize those who engage in hate speech or hate activities from accountability.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455553" data-originallang="en">We see the underuse and inconsistent use by law enforcement and prosecution services of existing criminal law tools. From my perspective, the issue is less about defining a hate crime and more about training through case scenarios, so police officers actually understand what you do in a specific case situation. I've worked with the Toronto Police on case scenarios pre-October 7, and I think it's of critical importance, especially now.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455554" data-originallang="en">We see the failure by many school administrations to enforce their own codes of conduct to protect students from harm.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455555" data-originallang="en">We see the use of slogans that incite violence, promote hatred and mirror unequivocal jihadist language and activities.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8455556" data-originallang="en">Finally, we see mainstream media stories. I don't bash the media generally, but what I see here are mainstream media stories that often minimize or ignore pro-Israel perspectives, subject Hamas's assertions to a lower level of scrutiny than Israeli assertions, treat unsupported assertions of fact and repeatedly fail to correct or give appropriate attention to the disproof or undermining of inflammatory assertions about Israel.</p>
