<p data-HoCid="8594926" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Speaker, I gave the foreign affairs minister two opportunities to condemn the increasingly common and terrifying anti-Semitic chants we hear in the streets, such as “Israel will soon be gone” and “There is only one solution! Intifada, revolution!” Twice she refused to condemn those remarks. She continues to pander to Hamas supporters and the Liberal Party as part of her leadership campaign rather than doing her job.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8594927" data-originallang="en">I will give her another chance. Will she publicly support Israel's right to retaliate against the tyrants of Tehran and the terrorists of Hezbollah and Hamas to protect itself, yes or no? </p>
