<p data-HoCid="7957664" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I know my hon. colleague is very sincere in her convictions on these matters.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957665" data-originallang="en">I wanted to pick up on the issue of the importance of establishing a humanitarian corridor and safe zones for the distribution of essential humanitarian assistance. Our party supports that and has called for that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957666" data-originallang="en">I want to note that the last time there was conflict between Gaza and Israel, there was one instance that we heard about at the foreign affairs committee where Hamas intentionally targeted a humanitarian crossing point.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7957667" data-originallang="en">I asked Canadian officials why Hamas would intentionally target a humanitarian crossing. Canadian officials at the time said:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7957668" data-originallang="en"> In terms of the reason...obviously the intention and the pressure on all parties Hamas may not have wanted alleviated instantly, to keep the pressure on and keep sending the message. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7957669" data-originallang="en">I wonder if the member would agree that as vitally important as establishing these humanitarian corridors are, one of the challenges has been, historically, that Hamas has shown capricious disregard for the lives of Palestinians and has, in fact, used their pain and the prevention of access for humanitarian aid as a tool to try to exert more pressure on the international community.</p>
