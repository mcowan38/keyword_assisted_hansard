<p data-HoCid="8342450" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Rivers, I would like to follow up on the comment made by my fellow member Ms. Gazan.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8342451" data-originallang="fr">From what we've heard so far in our red dress alert study, it's all based on trust. However, there does not seem to be any trust in the police forces.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8342452" data-originallang="fr">How do we square that circle? We want to do something to help indigenous women and girls. We want them to be involved in the decisions, but they don't trust the police, who must also be involved in the process. How do we do that?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8342453" data-originallang="fr">I'd like a quick answer. I know it's a tough question and you may need more time.</p>
