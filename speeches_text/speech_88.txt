<p data-HoCid="6110731" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Madam Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6110732" data-originallang="en">Thank you all.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6110733" data-originallang="en">Mr. Perrault, good to see you. Thank you for being here. I want to thank you and your entire team across the country. Elections Canada is the guardian of democracy, and it's very important that you continue to maintain public confidence in what you're doing. We're all grateful for the work you do.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6110734" data-originallang="en">I want to give you the opportunity to talk about what happened in the last election. There was an issue of election day falling on a Jewish holiday. I'd like to give you the opportunity to explain what happened and also discuss, moving forward, what your plans are in dealing with the potential conflict of holidays, especially in our increasingly multicultural country.</p>
