<p data-HoCid="8420490" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I want to pay tribute to three great Canadians who recently passed away. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8420491" data-originallang="en">Jerome Abraham struggled with addiction for many years before entering the recovery program at Discovery House in Penticton. After treatment, Jerome went on to lead Discovery House through a period of dramatic growth, helping so many men get their lives back and return to their families. We lost Jerome to cancer earlier this spring, but we will always be inspired by his legacy.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8420492" data-originallang="en"> Laura Savinkoff was the centre, the heart, of a very active peace community based in Grand Forks. I last saw Laura at a workshop she organized to discuss the horrific situation in Gaza. She died suddenly two weeks later, gone too soon, but we will remember her spirit.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8420493" data-originallang="en"> Finally, I want to mention the passing of Dr. Bruce Falls, a noted scientist and humble champion of nature conservation in Canada. Bruce died last month at the age of 100 after a lifetime of inspiring service to his country.</p>
