<p data-HoCid="8679240" data-originallang="en"> I would add that in respect of the opposition to settlement expansion and the creation of illegal settlements, which is what is happening right now in very significant numbers, Canada has done something. It has imposed sanctions on certain of the worst of the settlers who are creating violence in the West Bank, but it could do much more. It should consider imposing sanctions on ministers of the Israeli government who are advocating annexation and resettlement of Gaza. Those measures are directly contrary to a possible two-state solution. If we support a two-state solution, then we should be sanctioning those who try to prevent it. </p>
