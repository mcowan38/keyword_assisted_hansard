<p data-HoCid="8255473" data-originallang="en">Thank you. I won't be long. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8255474" data-originallang="en">I want to highlight that we have six requests to have the <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">minister</a> appear at this committee. I also want to highlight that we have very limited time in the coming weeks. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8255475" data-originallang="en">I'll quickly remind you there's a motion by Ms. Kwan on the Auditor General's report from October, which we need to have the <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">minister</a> appear on. I have another one to talk about immigration levels. I must also add that, just recently in the House, the Bloc had an opposition day when they also requested—and it was adopted—that we review the immigration targets. Those go together. That's very pertinent information we need to get from the minister. We also have a motion by my colleague Mr. McLean on Hong Kong MPF funds, which requests the minister—and the ministers of finance and foreign affairs—to be here. We then have the motion by Ms. Kwan on international students and the task force, as well as the cap on international study permits, with another request for the minister. The motion by Ms. Kwan on the ongoing conflicts in Sudan and Gaza needs the minister. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8255476" data-originallang="en">Finally, we have the motion I put forward about the supplementary estimates (C). As you know, we need to have the <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">minister</a> before the end of the supply period, which is the end of March. That means he must appear here either this week or the week we're here in March. I also note the IRB did not put in supplementary estimates (C). We don't need to hear from them on this, but we need to hear from the minister.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8255477" data-originallang="en">These are very important requests this committee has made to the <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">minister</a>. I'd be curious to know where we're at with those. If we aren't getting the minister, and if he's afraid to come to committee, as it sometimes seems he is.... He has been willing to come here and that's good, but we have lots of questions we need to get his answers on. I hope he would be willing to come to give those answers.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8255478" data-originallang="en">I'm curious to know where we're at with that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8255479" data-originallang="en">Thank you.</p>
