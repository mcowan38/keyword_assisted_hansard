<p data-HoCid="8467658" data-originallang="en">We're coming back to order, colleagues. I know some of you are just grabbing a coffee, but I want to keep us moving.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8467659" data-originallang="en">This is always a great opportunity to hear from our lovely civil servants. We have about 45 minutes. I have to leave you in about 10 or 15 minutes, but you'll be in the capable hands of Mr. Barlow, and we'll handle the estimates process.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8467660" data-originallang="en">There will be no opening remarks on this panel from our civil servants. We'll just dive right into questions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8467661" data-originallang="en">I'll start with six minutes, and I'll turn it over to the Conservative Party.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8467662" data-originallang="en">Mr. Barlow, it's over to you.</p>
