<p data-HoCid="6403376" data-originallang="en">You know, I have enormous respect for you and your questions. You did ask me that question in the House on one or two occasions.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6403377" data-originallang="en">I think our explanation of the vote speaks for itself, and you are well familiar with that. I had a chance to speak to Jewish communities across Canada to explain our position. I also spoke to my counterpart in Israel, with whom we have an extraordinary collaboration.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6403378" data-originallang="en">The Jewish community in Canada and around the world understands that Canada is a steadfast ally of Israel. You know well that we vote against the vast majority of these yearly Israel-related resolutions. We explained the reason why we voted in that manner, and we said that we reaffirm the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. I will continue to engage with the community, with whom I have many friends, probably as many as you, and for whom I have enormous respect. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6403379" data-originallang="en">We explained that. Ambassador Rae did that. The <a data-HoCid="214296" href="/politicians/justin-trudeau/" title="Justin Trudeau">Prime Minister</a> did that. It's not inconsistent with being a steadfast ally of Israel. If you look at our voting records, you will realize that our government has a position on votes. If you look at previous governments, it demonstrates very clearly that we are a steadfast ally, which is what our friends in Israel expect from Canada. </p>
