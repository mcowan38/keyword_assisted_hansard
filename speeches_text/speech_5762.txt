<p data-HoCid="8783175" data-originallang="en"> Well, I'm going to push back on this. In your departmental plan, under the heading “International cooperation on criminal justice”, it says:</p>
<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8783176" data-originallang="en"> Justice Canada will continue to support Canada’s criminal justice priorities internationally, ensuring that Canadian values and approaches are considered in the development of international norms and standards on crime prevention and criminal justice, as well as on genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. </p>
</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8783177" data-originallang="en">You're not even able to give a simple answer. What are Canada's values on those things? You can't even give me a clear answer on something that is very clearly happening in the West Bank at this moment. What are our values, if you as the minister are unable to provide a clear answer at this committee?</p>
