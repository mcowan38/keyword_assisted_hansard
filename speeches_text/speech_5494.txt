<p data-HoCid="8714988" data-originallang="en"> Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8714989" data-originallang="en">Again, thank you to the witnesses for being here.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714990" data-originallang="en"> I just want to get some clarity from you with regard to the Government of Canada's position.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714991" data-originallang="en"> Mr. Lévêque, obviously you know about the international court's decision that the illegal occupation of the territories is in fact illegal. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8714992" data-originallang="en">Canada does have a free trade agreement with Israel. I am wondering what the implications would be on the Canadian government if we were to recognize Palestine. Are there further actions that would need to be taken with regard to the fair trade agreement, considering that even at this point we're not adhering to international law by continuing to allow a free trade agreement that has specific indications for human rights abuses that are very clearly being committed?</p>
