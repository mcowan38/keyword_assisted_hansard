<p data-HoCid="8391497" data-originallang="en">What I am trying to say, Mr. Chair, genuinely, as somebody who has spent years trying to bring communities together, working with the Jewish and Muslim communities in my riding, bringing them together to try to solve problems together, instead of pitting people against each other.... I'm somebody who actually cares about this issue, who has six synagogues, two Jewish schools and a lot of Jewish constituents who are deeply concerned. I'm somebody who is begging people on this committee to say, for God's sake, for once, let us put partisanship aside and sit together and come up with a resolution that every single one of us can support.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8391498" data-originallang="en">Why is that so difficult? That is what I don't understand.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8391499" data-originallang="en">If you want to call this a filibuster, Mr. Chair, that's not what this is. This is somebody who genuinely cares about this issue who is saying that we need to find a way to work together.</p>
