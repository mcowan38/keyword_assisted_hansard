<p data-HoCid="8714660" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714661" data-originallang="fr">Thank you, Mr. Aumais, for your testimony and statements.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714662" data-originallang="en"> You said something that I think is very important for the committee. You answered a question that I was going to ask, which is whether or not, from the Government of Canada's perspective, the recognition of statehood is a political or a legally determined decision. You've clearly answered in the former rather than the latter.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8714663" data-originallang="en">Clearly, as you said, the recognition of statehood is something that should be approached with caution and should be done clearly and deliberately, but ultimately it is a deliberate political decision, and the manner of recognition is also a deliberate political decision. I appreciate your clarity on that point in your opening remarks. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8714664" data-originallang="en">I was going to ask what criteria would be in place and would have to be met in order for the recognition of statehood to be obtained. I think you'll probably answer by saying that it is a deliberate political decision of the political executive, so I won't ask that question. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8714665" data-originallang="en"> Maybe I'll ask a different question. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8714666" data-originallang="en">Broadly speaking, is it the department's view that the Oslo accords are the path for a two-state solution? </p>
