<p data-HoCid="8277130" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I would like to take us back in time almost 108 years. When the Treaty of Versailles was signed, one witness walked out saying that the terms were so harsh that they might lead to a second world war.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8277131" data-originallang="fr">Today, we are dealing with a situation where civilians were brutally attacked and have been detained since October 2023. On the Israeli side, they were attacked by Hamas. On the Palestinian side, civilians are also being brutally attacked by the Israeli government.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8277132" data-originallang="fr">We have a duty not to protect Hamas, but we also have a duty not to protect the Israeli government. There must be a limit to the escalating “eye for an eye” approach. Civilians, both Palestinian and Israeli, are the ones in need of protection.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8277133" data-originallang="fr">Does my colleague agree that civilians, not governments, are the ones we need to protect?</p>
