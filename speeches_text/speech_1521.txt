<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">I'm not familiar enough with NATO countries more broadly. I can speak to a couple of countries that have invested in this differently in the context of their military service. </p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">For example, Israel has a program in which they have required military service. Because they are responsible for accepting basically all citizens, they have established military service for people who are neurodivergent, for example, people on the autistic spectrum, and have found a way to have meaningful involvement by neurodivergent people within their military.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">In the United States there is more concern with injured veterans, particularly from the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. In the same way that Canada has a few ways that people who have been injured can continue to serve, I think that's really the best way of thinking about how we can expand those exemptions, particularly when we start looking at recruiting people in non-traditional occupations like cyber-operator. Is there a way of thinking about how we connect promotion to supervising, and could we perhaps look at disentangling those so people could maintain their one job without having to necessarily advance in a way that is traditionally viewed as “military”, by, for example, taking on supervisory work, and instead could kind of stay with their preferred cyber job at their computer or whatever? </p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">I'm sorry that I'm simplifying that a little bit, but there certainly are other countries that have expanded the definition of what it means to be able to “serve”. Oftentimes, that is rooted in more of a national service or semi-conscripted version of what military service is.</p>
