<p data-HoCid="8703291" data-originallang="en"> You know, I take the fringe accusation as a bit of a compliment, because Jews are actually commanded to wear tzitzit, which are literal fringes, to remind them of God's commandments. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8703292" data-originallang="en">I'm not saying that we are a fringe, because IJV and organizations like us are actually growing very significantly. Just since October 7, we've just about doubled in members and now have about 25 chapters across the country, including in Cape Breton. Really, we're all over the country.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703293" data-originallang="en">I think that is a way to delegitimize voices within the Jewish community who are supporting Palestinians. There's a lot of fearmongering in the community—and I grew up with it—to keep the community behind Israel. There's a lot of financing of different charities and things like that. There is sort of a reward for that. </p>
