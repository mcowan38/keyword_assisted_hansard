<p data-HoCid="6672325" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the <a data-HoCid="253393" href="/politicians/karina-gould/" title="Karina Gould">minister</a> says she takes anti-Semitism seriously, but her government is funding it in UNRWA-produced study materials. Again, these are UNRWA-produced study materials. The European Parliament has denounced UNRWA for hateful comments in study materials that it produces and continues to use, but the minister is still badly mis-characterizing the situation by referring to Palestinian authority textbooks. She had promised an investigation. She is failing to follow up and Canadian taxpayer dollars are still funding anti-Semitic hate.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6672326" data-originallang="en">When will the <a data-HoCid="253393" href="/politicians/karina-gould/" title="Karina Gould">minister</a> recognize what is happening and actually take action in response?</p>
