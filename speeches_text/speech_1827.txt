<p data-HoCid="7345422" data-originallang="en">I want to make this absolutely clear: The comments made by this individual are absolutely appalling. I've said this before and I'll say it again. They are reprehensible and vile. We condemn the anti-Semitism, racism and hatred that he has spread in the strongest possible terms.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345423" data-originallang="en">I thank MP Housefather for bringing this individual to our attention. When this issue was raised, we immediately asked the Department of Canadian Heritage to confirm the organization's project funding details and to inform us on the procedural next steps. After the review by the legal department, we followed the process in place to cut funding to the organization, as well as terminate the project.</p>
