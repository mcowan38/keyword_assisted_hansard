<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for <a data-HoCid="252741" href="/politicians/sven-spengemann/" title="Sven Spengemann">Mississaugaâ€”Lakeshore</a> for his hard work on this issue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">The $25 million in funding announced last week is being provided through trusted partners and will ensure that emergency relief quickly reaches Palestinian civilians whose humanitarian needs have only been worsened by this conflict. It will go beyond these urgent and immediate needs to also support recovery and rebuilding efforts. It will support critical peacebuilding and people-to-people initiatives to advance the goal of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. </p>
