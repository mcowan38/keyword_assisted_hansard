<p data-HoCid="8574329" data-originallang="en"> That's right. You are correct. Thank you very much to both of you for confirming that. It's been about a year, so I'm a little rusty. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8574330" data-originallang="en">I would like to propose, I suppose, a subamendment, but first I'll just discuss it, and then I'll move the subamendment.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8574331" data-originallang="en">I recognize that we have had officials' time to come, and we very much appreciate that. Also, the <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">minister</a> has made quite clear—and <a data-HoCid="300017" href="/politicians/dominic-leblanc/" title="Dominic LeBlanc">Minister LeBlanc</a> alluded to this as well, of course, and it's been public—that there are ongoing investigations in Immigration, CSIS and the RCMP, and CBSA are also involved in that. According to what the minister said today, he made it sound like in quite short order, a number of weeks, I believe was the quote, that would be concluded. He several times alluded to how we may have answers by then. I appreciate that there's an investigation, and Canadians expect that.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8574332" data-originallang="en">To give that a little bit of time, I think what we would propose is—since we've already agreed as a committee to have three additional meetings outside this current one, so three extra was already agreed to—rather than ask for more, we would amend the original motion, or this one, whatever works best, to say that both the <a data-HoCid="300017" href="/politicians/dominic-leblanc/" title="Dominic LeBlanc">Minister of Public Safety</a> and the <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">Minister of Immigration</a> would come respectively for two hours each, plus officials. That's what would be included in those remaining three meetings. The ministers would each come for two hours themselves, plus officials. That way we can ask them questions in response to the investigation.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8574333" data-originallang="en"> It is a bit like we're hitting a wall, and I think the Jewish community and others deserve answers on this. We've been hitting that “it's under investigation” wall. I would like to give the <a data-HoCid="300022" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">minister</a> an opportunity to respond once he can tell us more about the findings, and I would like the <a data-HoCid="300017" href="/politicians/dominic-leblanc/" title="Dominic LeBlanc">Minister of Public Safety</a>—I believe he would agree to it—to come back and answer once he has more information as well.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8574334" data-originallang="en">Our proposal is that. I could amend this motion or I could amend the original one, whatever you think would be better.</p>
