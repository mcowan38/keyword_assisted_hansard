Humanitarian aid needs to get to the civilians on the Gaza Strip and aid has to get there unconditionally, no matter where it comes from. To do its work under these circumstances, Canada needs a strong voice. It needs a strong voice to convey the desire for peace on behalf of our Israeli friends, Palestinian friends or friends of peace in general.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7959510" data-originallang="fr">In that spirit, will Canada join the initiative undertaken by the United States with Italy, Germany, France and the United Kingdom? </p>
