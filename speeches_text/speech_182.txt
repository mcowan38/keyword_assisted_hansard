<p data-HoCid="6116510" data-originallang="en">I agree with MP Gazan that we do want to be focused in this study, because I'm not sure of how many meetings we will have. I was just adding them up and it looks like there may be seven, maybe eight meetings, or maybe six, so we need to be focused. Of course, I have had my concerns about the homeless indigenous population in the city of London. I have since talked to the mayor of Brantford who has the Six Nations of the Grand River reserve in that community.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6116511" data-originallang="en">I think there is more than enough to study on the off-reserve housing, knowing full well that some urban communities have reserves incorporated into them and that it will be a part of our discussion.</p>
