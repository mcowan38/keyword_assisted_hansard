<p data-HoCid="8604951" data-originallang="en"> I would like to point to the second recommendation in our submission, which is our strategy for an IHRA literacy program. Canada adopted the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism in 2019. It is part of our anti-racism strategy, which was renewed in 2024 for another four-year period. However, there is a disconnect between the government strategy and its implementation. As a result, we aren't seeing enough familiarity with the strategy and the definition among the general public. That's leading to the growing figures as they relate to Holocaust denialism and disinformation. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8604952" data-originallang="en">By ensuring the next generation of Canadians—that's why we specifically want to target secondary and post-secondary students—is familiar with and understands the IHRA definition and what really constitutes contemporary anti-Semitism, we can begin to reduce some of those alarming figures you alluded to. The IHRA has a working definition. It's a guide. It has examples. If you don't understand the examples or are not using the guide, and if the guide isn't made expressly available to all Canadians, we're not properly implementing the definition.</p>
