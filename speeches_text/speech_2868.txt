<p data-HoCid="7966368" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my hon. colleague for this very important question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7966369" data-originallang="fr">I think everyone in the House is truly concerned about this right now. There is no place for hatred or violence here in Canada. We know that both the Jewish and Muslim communities, both the Israeli and Palestinian communities, are really hurting right now. They are scared.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7966370" data-originallang="fr">We all need to come together because, first and foremost, we are Canadians. We should be there for each other.</p>
