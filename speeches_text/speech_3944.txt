<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, today I met with Mansour Shouman, a Palestinian Canadian who risked his life to report on the devastation and horror of the war in Gaza. Weeks ago, the Liberals promised to stop selling military goods to Netanyahu and to sanction extremists. As innocent children continue to die, the Liberals have not issued export notices or announced sanctions. This is a betrayal of the hundreds of thousands of Canadians who want peace for Palestinians and Israelis.</p>
<p data-HoCid="0" data-originallang="en">We need a two-way arms embargo and sanctions. How many more people will die before the government acts?</p>
