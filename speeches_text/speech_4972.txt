<p data-HoCid="8594844" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, one year ago today, Jews experienced the worst attacks since the Holocaust. Innocent Jews were barbarically slaughtered; women's bodies were broken from vicious rape. Children were tortured in front of their parents, and people were burned alive and mutilated. Twelve hundred Jewish lives were horrifically ended that day, and 101 hostages continue to be held by the Hamas terrorists responsible for this massacre. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8594845" data-originallang="en">Unbelievably, right here in Canada, Jews have experienced relentless anti-Semitism since then, targeting Jewish businesses, schools, retirement homes and synagogues. It is a national failure that Jews no longer feel safe in this country, yet Jewish people continue to fight. Their resolve is stronger than ever. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8594846" data-originallang="en">Conservatives stand with them and with the State of Israel. We condemn the anti-Zionist hatred and the spineless Canadian leaders who have allowed it to take root here at home. Today, we pray for Israel and for the victory of western democratic values. </p>
