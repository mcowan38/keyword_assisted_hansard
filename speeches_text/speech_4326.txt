<p data-HoCid="8417159" data-originallang="en"> Madam Chair, in March there were several events in Canadian communities in which real estate sales of settlement homes in occupied Palestinian territory were promoted and real estate was potentially sold. There was a real estate tour called the Great Israeli Real Estate Event, which was held in Montreal and Toronto.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8417160" data-originallang="en">Israel's far right government has been expanding and authorizing illegal settlements at a rate that exceeds those of all previous years. Settlements are illegal under international law, and under Canadian policy they are an impediment to peace. They should be a priority of the department, given that this is illegal under domestic law and also given the increasing settler violence in the West Bank, which the <a data-HoCid="299996" href="/politicians/arif-virani/" title="Arif Virani">minister</a>'s government acknowledged last week when it imposed sanctions on extremist settlers.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8417161" data-originallang="en">Has the minister's department investigated these illegal sales that may violate the Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act, which lists population transfer by occupying powers as a recognized war crime under domestic law?</p>
