<p data-HoCid="7570933" data-originallang="en">I'll give two very tangible examples.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7570934" data-originallang="en"> One, as you mentioned, comes from budget 2022, and that is a patent box regime. Again, this is something that many other countries do very well. The idea is that you are taxing commercialized technologies that are developed here in Canada at a lower corporate tax rate to really encourage those patents. This is something that we should get up and running as soon as possible.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7570935" data-originallang="en">Another idea, which Israel does quite effectively, is a payback clause in terms of IP. When a company decides to offshore or sell technology that has been publicly invested in by Canadian taxpayers, there would be an obligation to repay that investment back to taxpayers, typically at a multiple of two or three times, just as a private sector investor would expect. Again, the idea is really to stimulate opportunities to protect that intellectual property and create that wealth over time.</p>
