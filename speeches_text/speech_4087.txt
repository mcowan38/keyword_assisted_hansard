<p data-HoCid="8406057" data-originallang="en"> I think a lot of it has to do with Jew hatred. I'm always saying that I think I'm more pro-Palestinian than the people who are screaming the things they're screaming, because I actually want the people in Gaza to have a decent life, but in order to do so, we have to get rid of Hamas. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8406058" data-originallang="en">I didn't see these people standing outside and screaming and chanting when Syria killed—murdered—500,000 Arabs or when Egypt didn't open the borders for the people of Gaza. I didn't see them going into the streets and protesting about it. I think it has everything to do with Jew hatred and it has nothing to do with the people in Gaza. It's sad to see.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8406059" data-originallang="en"> I also think that once you let criminals commit crimes without any consequences, they will continue to commit crimes. Once we see university administrations and university presidents taking steps and doing something against it, we will be able to stop it. We have to make sure that the university presidents are going to do something and are standing up against the criminals. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8406060" data-originallang="en">That's my opinion. </p>
