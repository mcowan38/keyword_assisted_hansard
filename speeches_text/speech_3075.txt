<p data-HoCid="8057139" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, while a four-day pause is delayed by a day, Israel has only intensified its bombing of the Gaza Strip. For six weeks now, the government has been unequivocal in demanding hostages be returned, as the government should be, and yet the government cannot even seem to bring itself to say the word “ceasefire”. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8057140" data-originallang="en">An estimated 5,500 children have now died in the Gaza Strip alone in recent weeks. Therefore, I ask again: How many children need to die before the government calls for a ceasefire?</p>
