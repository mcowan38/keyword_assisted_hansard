<p data-HoCid="7953994" data-originallang="en">Perhaps I could expand slightly. When you look at the history of innovation programming in this country, it's focused, really, on the inputs and on crude outputs, which is to say that if we're spending research dollars, then innovation will come. Too often in Canada that just hasn't been the case, so to take a very commercialization-focused approach is, as Nick said, a fairly substantial departure from what's been done before.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7953995" data-originallang="en"> I think it is a very interesting model. There is a lot of good evidence from abroad. Of course, it was built on the model of the Israeli Office of the Chief Scientist and on Business Finland, which have both been quite successful as peripheral agencies with a broad mandate to pursue change in a way that is insulated from core day-to-day government. That has worked well—in very different countries as well, I should add. In that sense, we think that's the right model to look at, and we're encouraged, as Nick said.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7953996" data-originallang="en"> It is crucially important that the leadership of that corporation be sensitive to industry and be from industry. I think that very often in this country—and I say this with great respect— the post-secondary education institutions have not been the key to unlocking productivity in this country and are going along on a simple research focus. I will say research is an essential component of innovation, but in itself, it is not innovation. Turning research and insights into products that we export and sell, and that drive wealth and productivity growth in this country, is the essential ingredient that we're missing, and we hope this will go some way to address that.</p>
