<p data-HoCid="8417400" data-originallang="en">Madam Chair, hate is on the rise in Canada. In fact, at our committee right now, we are studying anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. We could study anti anything these days.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8417401" data-originallang="en">I believe there is so much going on in the world that people just want to express their anger, and there is a lot happening. It is alarming ,and it is distressing to hear numerous accounts of hatred against people in our public forum. I firmly believe that hatred should have no place in Canada, but we do know that it exists. All people should feel and must feel safe to express themselves online and off-line. We know that is not the case.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8417402" data-originallang="en">I want to ask the <a data-HoCid="299996" href="/politicians/arif-virani/" title="Arif Virani">Minister of Justice</a> to please discuss this and to elaborate a bit further on what we can do to keep people safe from hatred.</p>
