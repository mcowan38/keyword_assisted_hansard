<p data-HoCid="8703289" data-originallang="en">Mr. Balsam, I want to give you the opportunity to reflect on what I consider to be an obvious contradiction. We heard about how the diversity of Palestinian ideologies and political affiliations somehow doesn't qualify them for statehood, yet there are some groups, including those who provided testimony today, who claim to speak on behalf of all Jewish people in Canada.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8703290" data-originallang="en">I would put to you, sir, that I've witnessed you and your organization sometimes being denigrated, sometimes being positioned as not having a legitimate Jewish voice, a progressive Jewish voice, in this conversation. I want to give you the opportunity to respond to that and to say why you feel that the diversity within this country might reflect a greater call for state recognition for Palestine than perhaps what some of the other witnesses may have presented to committee.</p>
