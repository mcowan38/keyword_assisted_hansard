<p data-HoCid="8212432" data-originallang="en">Mike, it's the <a data-HoCid="300012" href="/politicians/ahmed-hussen/" title="Ahmed Hussen">Minister of International Development</a> who has been in contact, but it was UNRWA itself that raised the issue with Canada. It was they who connected with us to talk about this issue. That is why we took note of what they were saying, and that is why we worked with other countries on this issue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8212433" data-originallang="en">I'm confident, and I have total trust in the head of the the investigation. She used to be my colleague. She's a person whom I respect a lot, the former minister of foreign affairs for France, Catherine Colonna. I really hope that the investigation can be, as I mentioned, very thorough, but also rapid, because we need to continue to provide humanitarian aid to Gaza, and UNRWA is fundamental in offering that humanitarian aid.</p>
