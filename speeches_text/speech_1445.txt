<p data-HoCid="6937165" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I would like to acknowledge my colleague, who is also from Manitoba, for his absolute disdain for the symbols of hate that have been flown during this illegal occupation. I would also like to thank him for his work around raising awareness around Holocaust denial. Holocaust denial is dangerous and we must put an end to it.</p>
