<p data-HoCid="6884426" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I imagine my Conservative colleague will take some solace in the fact that what the member for <a data-HoCid="278257" href="/politicians/kevin-lamoureux/" title="Kevin Lamoureux">Winnipeg North</a> said was not true. In fact, the government has taken the advice of the Conservatives and cancelled the Canada recovery benefit program. It has created a Canada worker lockdown benefit that so far has not applied anywhere in the country. Despite the program being retroactive, nobody will be able to qualify for it retroactively. I regret to say it may apply in some cases going forward because of omicron.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6884427" data-originallang="en">I was at a press conference earlier. My colleague for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a> has done some excellent work on the idea of a guaranteed livable basic income and has brought a bill forward to the House that I look forward to debating and passing. When we give people who are already living below the poverty line enough income to live with dignity, we are not giving them disposable income. We are giving them enough for rent and groceries.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6884428" data-originallang="en">There are a lot of people who could use more financial support who are not going to get disposable income out of it. What they are going to get is a bit of dignity and the ability to have a home, to depend on that home in the future and to not pay rent at the expense of knowing where they are going to get money for medication and groceries.</p>
