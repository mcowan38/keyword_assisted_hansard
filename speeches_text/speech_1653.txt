<p data-HoCid="7163625" data-originallang="en">To echo that, but in closing, I'd say it's about being proactive. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If we can get away from trade irritants before they become something, and have an expert on the ground who can walk local regulators through why it's not a concern and how Canada has already addressed an issue, it will go a long way. It won't be attention grabbing, but it will be something that facilitates trade and market access before it becomes a trade dispute or irritant.</p>
