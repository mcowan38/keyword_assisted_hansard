<p data-HoCid="6706490" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I would like to wish <em>Eid Mubarak</em> to everyone celebrating Eid al-Fitr in Pierrefondsâ€”Dollard and elsewhere.</p>
<p data-HoCid="6706491" data-originallang="en">Eid al-Fitr is a day of celebration after Ramadan, a month of fasting, patience and self-reflection. Normally, Eid is festive, filled with family visits, friends and food. For a second year, this Eid is unique. While many are taking the day off, socializing will have to keep Public Health guidelines in mind. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6706492" data-originallang="en">I know that this Eid many have a heavy heart. The strife in Jerusalem at Al-Aqsa Mosque and in other parts of the world is heartbreaking. Durable and dignified peace is possible, but the path to it is never easy. It requires continuous and ongoing work. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6706493" data-originallang="en">As we pass through these challenging times, let us pray that the next Eid is filled with family, friends and loved ones. </p>
<p data-HoCid="6706494" data-originallang="en"> <em>Eid Mubarak</em>.</p>
