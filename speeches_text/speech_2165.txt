<p data-HoCid="7663377" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, seniors across Canada are facing significant challenges. I hear from seniors, largely single women, who are struggling to make ends meet. They cannot afford housing, basic food, medication and heat. Almost 600,000 Canadian senior women are living in poverty. Far too many of those women are further marginalized because of who they are: indigenous, Black, persons of colour and those from the 2SLGBTQIA+ community. Others are widows of veterans who married their spouse of after 60 years of age and are left without a pension because of a sexist, outdated gold-diggers clause. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7663378" data-originallang="en">In Canada, we should have a guaranteed livable basic income, as Bill <a data-HoCid="11498374" href="/bills/44-1/C-223/" title="An Act to develop a national framework for a guaranteed livable basic income">C-223</a> by my friend, the member for <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>, would do. It is an amount that would would allow no one in this country to fall below the bar of basic dignity. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7663379" data-originallang="en">Canadians must ask themselves about the expense of abandoning those most in need and of their suffering. It is time to do better for seniors.</p>
