<p data-HoCid="8451219" data-originallang="fr">With all due respect to you, Mr. Champoux, I have to say that, frankly, I'm shocked by what you said.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8451220" data-originallang="fr">If the minister responsible for combatting racism doesn't have time in the next three weeks to appear before the committee with respect to Canada's anti-racism strategy—an important strategy for the Liberal government—what are we doing here?</p>
<p data-HoCid="8451221" data-originallang="fr">The Department of Canadian Heritage funds those efforts, and it is within the committee's purview to ask the minister what she's doing on the issue. We regularly invite ministers to appear before the committee. Talking about anti-Palestinian hate in Canada and other forms of hate such as anti-Semitism and Islamophobia is hugely important. As far as I'm concerned, that should be one of the Liberal minister's priorities. Otherwise, that tells you how much the Liberals prioritize Canada's anti-racism strategy and the serious work required to address the issue.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8451222" data-originallang="fr">For those reasons, I'm not going to withdraw my motion. I hope that the minister can find at least one hour in her schedule, in the three weeks remaining before the House adjourns, to come and speak with the committee about this essential strategy.</p>
