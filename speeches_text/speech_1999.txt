<p data-HoCid="7406421" data-originallang="en"> Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you for inviting me to speak to your committee.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7406422" data-originallang="en">The last time I had the honour of addressing the honourable parliamentarians of Canada, it was in relation to the Darfur genocide some 20 years ago. Here we are again, with “never again” happening again, this time in the Tigray region of Ethiopia. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7406423" data-originallang="en">I speak on this tragic matter from my perspective of experience with comparable situations. I was the first British government official to enter Rwanda in 1994 during the hundred days of killings, and I witnessed first-hand what a genocide looks like. I recall comparing notes, subsequently, with that great son of Canada, your former senator Lieutenant-General Roméo Dallaire, who headed the United Nations forces in Rwanda. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7406424" data-originallang="en">Not long afterwards, I had a ringside seat to the atrocities in Bosnia-Herzegovina, culminating in the Srebrenica genocide. Then, as special adviser to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, I was in Cambodia to examine the long and toxic aftermath of the 1975 genocide. Subsequently, in 2003-04, I headed the United Nations in Sudan, trying to stop the Darfur genocide, which unfolded on my watch. Sadly, we never prevented any of these genocides, although we had ample warning of them and could track their nasty progression in minute detail in real time; we could not claim ignorance of these matters. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7406425" data-originallang="en">The same is happening now in Tigray. Others will have testified before you about the depths of brutality and depravity being plumbed. My professional assessment is clear, based on my experience of nearly 30 years of international war and peace efforts: Progressive acts of genocide are being perpetrated by the governments and agents of the states of Eritrea and Ethiopia against Tigrayans. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7406426" data-originallang="en">I assert this categorically for the following reasons.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7406427" data-originallang="en">First is the orchestration of the violence on Tigrayans through the use of dehumanizing hate speech over Ethiopia's state communication channels and state-encouraged social media. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7406428" data-originallang="en">Second is the pattern of violence being experienced by Tigrayans. This includes direct attacks on civilians and mass rapes, as well as induced starvation, malnutrition, and epidemic risk and disease progression through a deliberate Ethiopian blockade of humanitarian relief, food and medicine. This is complemented by the systematic destruction of urban and rural livelihoods, including by cutting off electricity, Internet and banking. As these efforts are not targeted at combatants, generally, they are consequently violations of humanitarian law. They are war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7406429" data-originallang="en">Third is the systematization of these crimes through the Ethiopian and Eritrean authorities' command and control structures, in their official capacities. This imputes intent as well as proactive commission, not random acts of violence that can occur in the fog of war.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7406430" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, the Genocide Convention was defined in the aftermath of the Holocaust in the 1940s. Our world has changed immeasurably in the subsequent 70-plus years, and we must interpret the convention in today's context and realities. Putting together the pattern of the multi-faceted violence in Tigray in this, the second decade of the millennium, it is my conviction that the situation in Tigray is nothing less than a genocide.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7406431" data-originallang="en">Of course, there are many deniers. Denial is a hallmark of genocide, as we know from history. There are also apologists and distractors who argue that the conflict has complex causes and that atrocities have been committed on both sides. That may be true. It probably is true, but, as we saw in Second-World-War Europe, soldiers on all sides did terrible things, yet the genocide was committed only by the Nazis against Jews. Similarly, all groups suffered from violence in Rwanda, but the genocide was against only the Tutsi. Here, too, all of Ethiopia is suffering, including the Amhara and Oromo, but the genocide is against only Tigrayans.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7406432" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chair, war is not illegal. Sometimes it is even necessary. Civil war crosses all boundaries, but the commission of crimes against humanity, especially genocide, is always illegal. To test my assertion, we could ask the UN Security Council to rule on the matter or refer it to the International Criminal Court, but that's not going to happen any time soon, due to paralyzing UN geopolitics and the restricted referral rules at the ICC. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7406433" data-originallang="en"> African regional mechanisms for accountability are similarly handicapped, but that should not paralyze the planning. Genocide is a crime of universal jurisdiction, and all states have a duty to use their domestic legal systems to investigate it. Canada's courts could also do that. It would be good to get such legal determination, but parliamentarians are the supreme lawmakers in democratic states like Canada, where you have already declared the repression of the Uighurs in China as genocide. I would urge parliamentarians in Canada to consider such an inquiry, and for you to make your own determination.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7406434" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chairman, in conclusion, the explicit recognition of a genocide is important, not because we can prevent it, but to mitigate its worst effects so that humanity can rise again. That's why it's important that we don't keep on talking about the causes of the conflict and who attacked whom first and so on. That may or may not be relevant, but genocide, the commissioning of acts against humanity and crimes against humanity, is something that every country in the world and all legislatures in the world have a duty to do something about. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7406435" data-originallang="en">Mr. Chairman, I believe you and your colleagues have a prime duty, in a democracy in which you are the supreme lawmakers, to act through the mechanisms you have so that we can put an end to the inhumanities we're seeing in and around Tigray.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7406436" data-originallang="en">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p>
