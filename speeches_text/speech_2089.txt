<p data-HoCid="7494502" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the government has said a lot of words over the last seven years, and the government has spent, or claims to have spent, a lot of money, yet here we are. I appreciate the <a data-HoCid="278922" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">minister</a>'s willingness to be non-partisan, but at the end of the day, he is the one who writes the memorandums to cabinet. He is the one who has responsibility for oversight. It is actually his fiduciary responsibility to the country to break down the silos, and here we are.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7494503" data-originallang="en">Would the <a data-HoCid="278922" href="/politicians/marc-miller/" title="Marc Miller">minister</a> today commit, in light of these murders, to immediately implementing the call for justice that would require an independent oversight body to ensure that the government is actually meeting its spending objectives, as opposed to just making announcements and then, per my colleague from <a data-HoCid="278288" href="/politicians/leah-gazan/" title="Leah Gazan">Winnipeg Centre</a>'s Order Paper question from earlier this year, spending minimal amounts of money while indigenous women are still being taken, still being murdered and still freezing to death on the streets of Winnipeg?</p>
