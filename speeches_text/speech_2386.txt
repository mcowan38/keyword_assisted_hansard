<p data-HoCid="7835937" data-originallang="en">Thanks very much, Mr. Chair. We all owe you.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7835938" data-originallang="en">I want to reiterate the importance that the money is being reclaimed in the Laith Marouf case, though I do believe, given that there are members of the Conservative caucus who met with a vile anti-Semitic and Islamophobic neo-Nazi, that it's a bit rich for the Conservatives to give any lessons around anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7835939" data-originallang="en">That said, I wanted to come to the issue of copyright. </p>
<p data-HoCid="7835940" data-originallang="en">A number of organizations are looking to update the Copyright Act. It is a little unclear who is taking that one and it is a little unclear what the timelines are. Can you update us on this badly needed update to the Copyright Act and how much of it is on your desk and how much is on other ministers' desks? </p>
