<p data-HoCid="7345457" data-originallang="en"> Thank you so much to the honourable member for her important question.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345458" data-originallang="en">I will say once again that part of our responsibility is to make sure that we learn from the fact that, in this particular case, the vetting process failed, and we're taking swift action to make sure this never happens again. We're doing so by introducing a new vetting process that is being established by the Department of Canadian Heritage. We're enhancing the agreement between Canadian Heritage and applicants—organizations applying for funding—and introducing further penalties to successful applicants who showcase racism, hate and bigotry. We will continue to take every measure to ensure this never happens again.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345459" data-originallang="en">We are also putting in place enhanced vetting training for program officers, ensuring that multiple officials review each and every application, and enhanced anti-racism and anti-Semitism training for all program officers. To develop this training, we will be working with the special envoy to combat anti-Semitism, the Honourable Irwin Cotler. We'll also be working with the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center and the Jewish Public Servants' Network to develop this program. It will also include training on the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345460" data-originallang="en">We'll also implement conditions in all funding agreements to allow the government to take immediate action if any organization or individual is identified as having promoted hate and to ensure that all organizations that see their funding cut in this manner will never be eligible for future funding.</p>
<p data-HoCid="7345461" data-originallang="en">I want to assure members of the committee that not a single federal dollar will be rolling out until these measures are fully in place. We're working to ensure that these measures are in place as quickly as possible.</p>
