<p data-HoCid="8057141" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, of course, we condemn the October 7 terrorist attack by Hamas. We are extremely preoccupied with what is happening in Gaza. I have said it many times. It is one of the worst places, if not the worst place, to live in the world, and too many women and children have died. That is why we welcome the humanitarian pause that will be happening, starting tomorrow, that has been agreed to between Israel and Hamas and brokered by Qatar. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8057142" data-originallang="en">We will continue to support the fact that Canadians need to get out of Gaza. Civilians must be protected. Humanitarian aid must go. Hostages need to be released.</p>
