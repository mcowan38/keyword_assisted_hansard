<p data-HoCid="8756834" data-originallang="en"> Madam Speaker, I appreciate that the <a data-HoCid="311624" href="/politicians/pam-damoff/" title="Pam Damoff">parliamentary secretary</a> spoke of the importance of humanitarian aid getting into Gaza. She also spoke of condemning the murder of civilians in Gaza. In light of that, what I have been calling for is what we have heard from activists across the country: Canada should resume its work as a peacemaker in the world. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8756835" data-originallang="en">If we are going to stand up in the face of this genocide in Gaza, we should start by calling for a true, two-way arms embargo and following through on that. The <a data-HoCid="311624" href="/politicians/pam-damoff/" title="Pam Damoff">parliamentary secretary</a> and I have spoken about that in this place before, along with recognizing the state of Palestine, as I shared earlier. In light of her comments tonight, will she advocate within the government to ensure that we have a true, two-way arms embargo in place?</p>
