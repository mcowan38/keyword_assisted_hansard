<p data-HoCid="8459706" data-originallang="en">If you have an issue with the actions of a member who you feel violated your privilege, then I'm asking you to state specifically where that violation occurred. The outside circumstances or the opinions of others do not matter to this committee. What matters is whether a member feels like their privileges have been violated.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8459707" data-originallang="en"> I'll remind members as well, and I'm reminding you, Ms. Khalid, that anything that happens outside of this committee, whether it's a social media post or otherwise, is a matter that can be taken up by the Speaker of the House of Commons. We have seen in the past that points of order or questions of privilege have been raised in the House of Commons, and the Speaker has in some circumstances ruled on those.</p>
<p data-HoCid="8459708" data-originallang="en"> Any form of litigation related to this, any Twitter messages...because, look, speaking frankly to the committee, we can go down a very deep rabbit hole on the issue of Twitter. </p>
