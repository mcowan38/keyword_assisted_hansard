<p data-HoCid="8303162" data-originallang="en">Through you, Madam Chair, Professor Luciuk, my colleague Mr. Kmiec just said, we will never provide a propaganda win for Russia again. However, if we think back to what transpired after Mr. Hunka's gallery appearance and the conduct in the House by Conservatives—and by all parties, to be fair—for Conservative members to now suggest that we can't provide Russian propaganda a win, when in fact some of their own tweets and responses were actually used by Russia to further propaganda, I can only imagine how hurtful and harmful this is to the Jewish community and certainly to Holocaust survivors to see that heightened. </p>
<p data-HoCid="8303163" data-originallang="en">Could you speak to the propaganda that was actually perpetrated by the House reaction, by some members more than others, and actually used by Russia?</p>
