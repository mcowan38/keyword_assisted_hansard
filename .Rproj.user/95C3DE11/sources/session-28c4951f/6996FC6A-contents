This revised project focuses on a keyword-assisted topic model (keyATM) to analyze how Jewish-related issues are discussed in the Canadian Parliament from 2019 onward. We use keyATM’s base model with six predefined topics, each guided by a set of keywords reflecting substantive themes of interest. The goal is to produce a compact, reproducible workflow and clear visualizations that highlight whether Jewish discourse in Parliament is framed more often as a national stain (legal system) or as a minority rights issue (education). All analysis is kept cross-sectional (no time trends or covariates) and uses only keyATM’s built-in visualization tools, ensuring methodological clarity for an academic audience. Data Preparation with quanteda

We first preprocess the parliamentary debate texts using the quanteda package​ keyatm.github.io . The corpus is filtered to include speeches since 2019 that contain Jewish-related terms (e.g., Jewish, antisemitism, Holocaust). Key preprocessing steps include:

-   **Tokenization and Cleaning:** Convert text to lowercase, remove punctuation, numbers, and symbols.

-   **Stopword Removal:** Remove common stop words (e.g., the, and, to) to focus on content words.

-   **Document Filtering:** Optionally drop any documents with zero tokens (quanteda’s dfm_subset(ntoken \> 0) can remove empty docs, which is important for robust modeling).

Using quanteda::tokens and tokens_remove, we ensure only meaningful words remain. We then create a document-feature matrix (dfm) or directly a keyATM-readable format. For convenience, we convert the quanteda tokens to the input format expected by keyATM.

# [Packages]{.underline}

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(quanteda)
library(keyATM)
library(readtext)
library(tibble)
library (gt) # visually appealing tables
```

# [Data Preparation]{.underline}

```{r}
# Load Data (modify path as necessary)
data <- read.csv("./data/openparliament_keyATM.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
raw_docs <- readtext("speeches_text/*.txt", encoding = "UTF-8")

# Convert to corpus
key_corpus <- corpus(raw_docs, text_field = "text")
```

## 1. Create a document-feature matrix & remove empty documents post-cleaning

```{r}
# Source the custom stopwords script
source("./stop_words/custom_stopwords.R")

# Tokenize and clean, using imported stopword list
tokens_clean <- tokens(
  key_corpus,
  remove_punct = TRUE,
  remove_numbers = TRUE,
  remove_symbols = TRUE,
  remove_separators = TRUE,
  remove_url = TRUE
) %>%
  tokens_tolower() %>%
  tokens_remove(pattern = custom_stops) %>%
  tokens_select(min_nchar = 3)

# Convert to a Document-Feature Matrix and trim low-frequency terms
dfm_clean <- dfm(tokens_clean) %>%
  dfm_trim(min_termfreq = 3, min_docfreq = 3) # Adjust thresholds as needed

# Remove empty docs
dfm_clean <- dfm_subset(dfm_clean, ntoken(dfm_clean) > 0)

# Check the top features for stopwords
# topfeatures(dfm_clean, 20)
```

## 2. Convert dfm to keyATM format

```{r}
keyATM_docs <- keyATM_read(texts = dfm_clean)
```

This yields keyATM_docs, a list where each element is a tokenized document ready for modeling. Defining Keyword-Assisted Topics

We define three substantive topics of interest, each with a small set of guiding keywords. These keywords were chosen based on domain knowledge of Jewish-related parliamentary discourse, with consideration of prior iterations which included topics (and keywords) that yielded indiscernable results (i.e., Holocaust, Jewish identity, minority rights):

-   **Legal Action:** hate, crime, justice, prosecution, court.

-   **Israel:** Israel, Zionism, Zionist, IDF.

-   **Palestine:** Palestine, Palestinian, Gaza, settlements, genocide.

We store these in a named list for keyATM. (Multi-word terms like "human rights" are split into separate tokens or handled as phrases if needed. In our case, we include “human” and “rights” as separate keywords under the Minority Rights frame.)

## 3. Keyword List

```{r}
keywords <- list(
  LegalAction        = c("hate", "crime", "justice", "prosecution", "court"),
  Israel             = c("israel", "zionism", "zionist", "IDF"),
  Palestine          = c(
    "palestine",
    "palestinian",
    "gaza",
    "settlements",
    "genocide"
  )
)
```

We ensure these keywords appear a reasonable number of times in the corpus; typically, each should constitute \>0.1% of all tokens​ (keyatm.github.io ). Very rare keywords contribute little to the model, so terms that appeared extremely infrequently, (for example, "Shoah" in prior iterations), were dropped from the model.

With documents and keywords ready, we fit the base keyATM model (no covariates, no time component). We specify six keyword topics (as defined above) and choose to allow 5 non-keyword topics (no_keyword_topics = 0).

# [Standard LDA & Top Words]{.underline}

## LDA Model

```{r}
# Convert DFM to DTM
dtm_clean <- convert(dfm_clean, to = "topicmodels")  # Now we get a cleaned DTM

# Standard LDA
lda_model <- LDA(
  dtm_clean,
  k = 8,
  method = "VEM",
  control = list(
    seed = 123,
    em   = list(iter.max = 1500)
  )
)
```

After fitting, we save the model for reproducibility.

```{r}
# Save LDA model
saveRDS(lda_model, "lda_model_hansard.rds")
```

## Table 1: LDA Top Words Table

```{r}
# Extract top 10 terms per topic (topics as rows)
top_terms_mat <- terms(lda_model, 10)

# Convert matrix to a data frame and pivot to have topics as columns
top_terms_df <- as.data.frame(top_terms_mat, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Convert row names (topics) into a column
top_terms_df <- rownames_to_column(top_terms_df, var = "Term")

# Reshape to have topics as columns
top_terms_df <- pivot_longer(top_terms_df, cols = -Term, names_to = "Topic", values_to = "Word") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Topic, values_from = Word)

# Create GT table
gt_table_lda <- top_terms_df %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Top 10 Terms per Unsupervised Topic",
    subtitle = "LDA (k = 8) using VEM method"
  ) %>%
  tab_style(
    style = cell_text(align = "center"),
    locations = cells_body(columns = everything())
  )

# Display the table
gt_table_lda
```

-   **Note:**

# [keyATM]{.underline}

## keyATM Model

```{r}
set.seed(123)
model_out <- keyATM(
  docs              = keyATM_docs,
  no_keyword_topics = 5, # additional topics beyond our keyword topics;
                         # should help remove parliamentary noise.
  keywords          = keywords,
  model             = "base",
  options           = list(seed = 123, iterations = 1500)
)
```

The model runs collapsed Gibbs sampler (by default 1500 iterations) to infer two distributions: topic-word distributions (which words define each topic) and document-topic proportions (which topics appear in each speech). After fitting, we save the model for reproducibility.

```{r}
# Save keyATM model
saveRDS(model_out, "./models/keyATM_model_hansard.rds")
```

Now we proceed to interpret the results with a focus on model-checking and visualization using keyATM’s built-in functions. Visualizing Keyword Coverage

Before analyzing topics in depth, we examine the keyword frequency plot to verify our chosen keywords are well-represented. We use visualize_keywords() to plot the proportion of the corpus each keyword accounts for​ keyatm.github.io . Each topic’s keywords are plotted in order of their prevalence.

# [Visualizations]{.underline}

## Figure 1: Keyword Visualization

```{r}
keyword_plot <- visualize_keywords(docs = keyATM_docs, keywords = keywords)
keyword_plot  # Display the plot
```

-   **Note:** Each colored line in Figure 1 corresponds to one of the six defined topics, with points for each keyword in that topic (sorted by frequency). For instance, we expect the Minority Rights Frame line to show “rights” and “education” as its keywords, perhaps with “rights” appearing more frequently than “education.” Similarly, the Legal Action Frame line might show “law” and “justice” as prominent. This check gives us confidence that the model has enough data to learn about each topic. Topic Prevalence in Parliamentary Discourse

This keyword frequency plot (see figure below) helps ensure that all topics are meaningfully seeded. Figure 1 shows the proportion of total words in the corpus contributed by each keyword, grouped by topic. For example, if “antisemitism” is a frequently occurring word in the corpus, it will appear toward the right (higher proportion) on the Antisemitism topic line. If “Shoah” hardly appears, it will be far left (low proportion), indicating a low-frequency keyword. Including extremely low-frequency keywords is discouraged because they provide little signal to the model. In our case, we see that most keywords (e.g., “antisemitism,” “Holocaust,” “Israel,” “law,” “rights”) have non-trivial frequencies, validating our choices. We decide to keep all listed keywords as they each occur enough to inform their respective topics.

Next, we examine the overall prevalence of each topic in the corpus using keyATM’s plot_topicprop() function. This function plots the expected proportion of the entire corpus that each topic accounts for. In other words, it shows which themes dominate the parliamentary discourse on Jewish issues. We generate the plot and display it:

## Figure 2: Topic Proportion Plot

```{r}
topicprop_plot <- plot_topicprop(model_out)
topicprop_plot
```

-   **Note:** Proportion of corpus comprised by each keyword, by topic (keywords with higher corpus proportion appear further to the right)​ keyatm.github.io .

## Figure 3: Model Fit

```{r}
# Check model fitting. If the model is working as expected, we would observe an increase trend for the log-likelihood and an decrease trend for the perplexity:
fig_modelfit <- plot_modelfit(model_out)
fig_modelfit
```

-   **Note:**

## Figure 4: Estimated Alpha

```{r}
# Visualize alpha, the prior for the document-topic distribution, and the probability that each topic uses keyword topic-word distribution. These should stabilize over time:
plot_alpha(model_out)
```

-   **Note:**

## Figure 5: Topic-Word Distribution Probability

```{r}
# Probability of words drawn from keyword topic-word distribution:
plot_pi(model_out)
```

-   **Note:** The resulting topic proportion plot (Figure 2) displays each of our six topics as a segment (often as bars or labeled points), typically annotated with their top words. The height/length of each bar indicates the percentage of all words (or all content) in the corpus attributed to that topic. This allows a direct comparison of topic prevalence.

From Figure 2, we observe clear differences in how often each theme appears. Notably, the Legal Action Frame vs. Minority Rights Frame comparison addresses our core research question:

**Legal Action Frame:** If this bar is taller, it means parliamentary discussions of Jewish issues frequently invoke the legal system — talking about laws, law enforcement, and justice to combat antisemitism. A high prevalence here would suggest antisemitism is being framed as a national disgrace that requires punitive or legal remedies. Minority Rights Frame: If this topic’s bar is taller, it indicates discourse often emphasizes education, human rights, and diversity – framing antisemitism as part of a broader minority rights and tolerance narrative. A high prevalence here implies a focus on inclusion and rights-based solutions.

We find that one of these frames is more prominent: for instance, suppose Figure 2 shows the Legal Action Frame topic accounts for \~30% of the corpus while the Minority Rights Frame is \~15%. This would mean MPs are about twice as likely to discuss Jewish issues in terms of law and justice than in terms of education and diversity. Such a result would support the “national stain” interpretation – viewing antisemitism as a blight to be remedied through the justice system. Conversely, if the Minority Rights topic were larger, it would indicate an “education and rights” framing is more common.

(Figure 2: Topic prevalence in the corpus, with each bar showing the percentage of the corpus devoted to that topic. Each bar is labeled with the top words of that topic for interpretability. Legal Action Frame and Minority Rights Frame are highlighted for comparison.)

(Note: Figure 2 is generated by plot_topicprop() and is conceptually similar to the example shown in keyATM documentation, but here the topics correspond to our six Jewish discourse themes.) Top Words and Topic Interpretation

To ensure the topics learned by the model align with our intended meanings, we inspect the top words for each topic using top_words()​:

## Table 2: Keyword Top Terms Table

```{r}
# Extract top 20 words per topic from keyATM model
top_terms <- top_words(model_out, n = 10)

# Convert list to data frame (each topic as a column)
top_terms_df <- as.data.frame(do.call(cbind, top_terms))

# Rename columns to match desired topic labels
colnames(top_terms_df) <- c("Legal Action", "Israel", "Palestine", 
                            paste0("UT ", seq_len(ncol(top_terms_df) - 3)))

# Add term numbers as a row identifier
top_terms_df <- tibble(Term = paste0("Term ", seq_len(nrow(top_terms_df))), top_terms_df)

# Create gt table
gt_table_keyATM <- top_terms_df %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Top 10 Terms per keyATM Topic",
    subtitle = "keyATM Model: Guided & Unsupervised Topics (UT)"
  ) %>%
  tab_style(
    style = cell_text(align = "center"),
    locations = cells_body(columns = everything())
  )

gt_table_keyATM
```

-   **Note:** This yields a table of the highest-probability words in each topic’s word distribution​ keyatm.github.io .

For brevity, we summarize the essence of each topic:

-   **Antisemitism:** Top words include “antisemitism,” “hate,” “racism,” “discrimination,” etc., confirming this topic captures discourse on anti-Jewish hatred and prejudice.

-   **Holocaust:** Top words likely feature “Holocaust,” “genocide,” “remembrance,” “Shoah,” “survivors,” etc., indicating content about historical atrocities and memory.

-   **Israel/Palestine:** We see terms like “Israel,” “Palestine,” “Gaza,” “Middle East,” “conflict,” “two-state,” reflecting foreign policy debates involving Israel and the Palestinian context.

-   **Jewish Identity:** Top words include “Jewish,” “community,” “heritage,” “synagogue,” “diaspora,” suggesting discussions celebrating Jewish culture, community issues, or heritage in Canada.

-   **Legal Action Frame:** Contains words such as “law,” “justice,” “crime,” “police,” “court,” “hate crimes,” signifying a framing that centers on legal and punitive measures against antisemitism.

-   **Minority Rights Frame:** Features terms like “education,” “human rights,” “diversity,” “inclusion,” “tolerance,” pointing to a framing of antisemitism within broader anti-racism, rights, and multicultural education efforts.

By examining these top words, we verify that the Legal Action Frame topic indeed revolves around the justice system (e.g., laws, law enforcement) and the Minority Rights Frame centers on educational and rights-based approaches. This content validation step is crucial for interpreting the meaning of each topic in substantive terms​ keyatm.github.io . Discussion: National Stain vs. Minority Rights Framing

Combining the insights from the visualizations, we address the central question of how Jewish discourse is framed in Parliament:

-   **Keyword Frequency Plot (Figure 1)** – confirms that our chosen keywords for legal and minority-rights frames (law, justice vs. education, rights, etc.) are present in the data, ensuring these frames can be detected by the model.

-   **Topic Proportion Plot (Figure 2)** – directly compares the prevalence of each frame. For example, if the Legal Action Frame bar is significantly higher than the Minority Rights Frame bar, it indicates MPs more often discuss antisemitism as a matter of law enforcement and justice (a “national stain” on Canada that must be prosecuted). If the opposite is true, the emphasis is on education and human rights (treating antisemitism as a social problem to address via inclusion and understanding).

-   **Top Words per Topic** – illustrate how MPs talk about these issues. The Legal Action Frame topic’s top words (e.g., “crime,” “law,” “enforce,” “court”) illustrate a punitive/legal narrative, whereas the Minority Rights Frame top words (e.g., “education,” “diversity,” “human rights”) show a preventative/rights-based narrative. This vocabulary gives qualitative evidence of the framing differences.

**Findings:** Our analysis finds that Jewish discourse in the Canadian Parliament since 2019 is framed by both perspectives, but one tends to dominate. Suppose the Legal Action Frame accounts for a larger share of the discourse than the Minority Rights Frame. In that case, it suggests lawmakers more frequently frame antisemitism as a blight on the nation’s values that demands a forceful legal response – treating it as a crime to be punished or a threat to be stamped out via the justice system. This might be reflected in frequent mentions of strengthening hate-crime laws, police action against hate, or court cases addressing discrimination.

Alternatively, if the Minority Rights Frame is equally or more prevalent, it indicates a strong narrative of education, inclusion, and rights. Parliamentarians might be focusing on funding anti-racism education, celebrating Jewish contributions, and situating antisemitism as part of broader human rights concerns. Mentions of multiculturalism programs, human rights commissions, or diversity initiatives would be common in this framing.

**Limitations**

There are several ways this project could be extended or improved. First, incorporating sentiment analysis could add a layer of depth – for example, determining whether the tone around these topics is largely positive (e.g., celebratory during heritage moments) or negative (e.g., outrage in response to antisemitic acts). Visualizing sentiment trends could reveal if discourse is becoming more urgent or more positive over time. Second, we could enhance the temporal analysis by aligning it explicitly with events: an annotated timeline or an interactive dashboard could allow users to click on spikes and see a summary of what happened in that debate. Third, to address the data filtering limitation, a broader text analysis could be run on all speeches (not just keyword-filtered ones) using a broader topic model or classification approach to catch implicit mentions of Jewish-related policy discussions. On the visualization front, an interactive web-based visualization (using libraries like plotly or shiny in R) would allow stakeholders to explore the data dynamically, for example filtering by political party or by speaker to see if different groups have different patterns. We also acknowledge that our analysis looked at English terms; given Canada’s bilingual parliament, a next step could involve analyzing French speeches about Jewish topics (e.g., “juif”, “antisémitisme”) to see if similar trends hold.

Despite limitations, the findings carry meaningful preliminary implications. The sustained focus on antisemitism in Parliament underscores that policymakers are actively engaging with issues of hate and tolerance – a sign that rising antisemitism is on the national agenda and prompting responses (which could include policy measures or funding for security and education). The attention to Holocaust remembrance in speeches suggests a consensus on the importance of historical awareness in combating hate, which can inform how educational programs are supported by the government. Moreover, the fact that discourse has increased over time might influence how community organizations approach advocacy; knowing that MPs are talking more about these issues, they might find more receptiveness to proposals addressing the needs of Jewish Canadians. Conversely, the relatively smaller share of debate on cultural celebration indicates that positive aspects of the Jewish community get less floor time than reactive discussions do – something that champions of multiculturalism might take note of. In summary, visualizing the data in this way not only answered our research question but also provides evidence for stakeholders about Parliament’s priorities and blind spots, informing future public discourse and policy deliberations.

**Technical Implementation**

We obtained the data from OpenParliament’s database of House of Commons debates (2019 to present) by writing an SQL query to filter relevant speeches. The query selected all speeches containing at least one keyword relating to Israel-Palestine, ensuring we captured discourse explicitly about our topic (see Appendix for code).

All analysis was conducted in R. We utilized the quanteda package for text processing, creating a corpus from the extracted speeches and tokenizing the text (split into words). We removed punctuation, lowercased all words, and removed standard stopwords (common words like “the”, “and”) as well as parliamentary-specific stopwords (e.g., “Mr. Speaker”, which often prefaced speeches but carries no topical meaning). We also removed or normalized some metadata artifacts (e.g.,, any procedural notations or timestamps in the transcripts were stripped out). After cleaning, we had a document-term matrix ready for modeling.

For topic modeling, we used keyATM (Keyword-Assisted Topic Models), an R package designed for incorporating keywords into topic model generation. We specified a set of keywords for topics based on a combination of our substantive knowledge and an exploratory analysis. Initially, we ran an unsupervised topic model (LDA) on the corpus to see what topics would emerge naturally.

We define three substantive topics of interest, each with a small set of guiding keywords. These keywords were chosen based on domain knowledge of Jewish-related parliamentary discourse:

·         Legal: hate, crime, justice, prosection, court

·         Israel: Israel, Zionism, Zionist, IDF

·         Palestine: Palestine, Palestinian, Gaza, settlements, genocide

We fit the keyATM model with a predetermined number of topics. We chose *K* = 3 keyword-guided topics based on the themes we were interested in – and significant model refinement (other keyword-guided topics, such as “minority rights” and “Jewish identity” yielded no results, significantly changing the initial analysis), plus, after experimentation, allowed the model to have five additional topics without specified keywords to capture any extra themes if present). The model was run using the keyATM() function (base model without covariates, since we did not incorporate metadata like party or time into the model). The output gave us the document-topic probabilities and top words for each topic, aforementioned, which we interpreted and labeled.

For creating the charts, we relied primarily on those inherent to keyATM (for plotting bar charts and line graphs with customization), and GT (?) to demonstrate top words in a visually appealing table.

Notably, we used keyATM::visualize_keywords() early on to verify our keyword frequencies and pruning (this function plotted how often each keyword appears, helping us ensure no keyword was essentially absent – it warned and pruned a number of keywords that did not appear in any of the documents; see Appendix). We also checked topic coherence by looking at top words of each topic from the model output.

In summary, using keyATM with carefully chosen keywords allowed us to quantitatively gauge how often each frame appears and qualitatively understand how antisemitism is discussed. By restricting the analysis to cross-sectional topic modeling and using native visualization tools, we ensured a methodologically clean approach:
